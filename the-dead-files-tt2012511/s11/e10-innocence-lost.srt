1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,612
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

2
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,081
There is a vortex here.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,316
It's just out of control.

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,418
I'm getting attacked.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,522
She's, like, praying and crying
and praying and crying.

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,093
I saw a dark figure
standing right there.

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,528
They can kill
the living person here.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,664
He died instantly.

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,636
It's not okay to be
in this location at all.

10
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,771
This is not a good situation.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,873
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,208
There is death here.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,110
Don't want to go down there.

14
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,478
I see dead people.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,513
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

16
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,249
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,886
She is definitely
a serial killer.

18
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,520
...and they speak to me.

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,090
She is going to torture them.

20
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,593
But there is only one way
to know if my findings are real.

21
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,662
They were all murdered.

22
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,364
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,932
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,733
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,203
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

26
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,240
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,944
There is no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

28
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,846
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,381
Who do you think possessed you?

30
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,216
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,318
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,586
...until the very end.

33
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,154
Well, you're not gonna
wanna see this.

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,623
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,058
Hell no.

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,392
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,762
Everyone is in jeopardy.

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,311
I'm in the small town
of Elkview, West Virginia.

39
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,813
It's about 15 miles
north of Charleston.

40
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,882
I got a call from a mother
of two named Sara.

41
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,885
Now, she says something
in her house is attacking her,

42
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,320
scaring her kids,

43
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,689
and she thinks someone
is gonna get hurt.

44
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,091
She sounded really bad,
and I'm hoping Amy

45
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,226
and I can help her out.

46
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,164
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,435
I clear the area of
any leading information.

48
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,305
This house is filled
with family photos,

49
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,774
so it's important that
I cover or remove them all.

50
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,780
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,663
Boy. Boy. Boy.
Boy. Boy.

52
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,431
There is at least
three time periods

53
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,133
of different dead people here,

54
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,601
and they're stuck
with each other,

55
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,003
so they're always fighting.

56
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:55,641
So it's kind of a mess.

57
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:01,279
This location here is kind of
caught in the crosshairs

58
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,384
of this crazy...

59
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,719
It's really bad.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,031
You know, Sara, when we spoke
on the phone,

61
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,198
you sounded terrified.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,867
What the hell's going on
in this house?

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,570
I'm at my breaking point.

64
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,574
The activity now
has got violent,

65
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,309
and it's just out of control.

66
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,577
I'm getting attacked.

67
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,446
My boys are being scared.

68
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,314
We need help.

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,516
If something can't be done,

70
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,920
it's gonna tear
my family apart.

71
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,657
All right. So who exactly
lives in the house?

72
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,127
Myself. We have my husband,
Mark, our youngest boy,

73
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,065
Tanner, he's 10,
and we have Lane that is 13.

74
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,034
All right, so how long have
you guys been living here?

75
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,670
We bought the house in 2002.

76
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,440
We had Tanner in 2006.

77
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,809
By the time that he was 2,

78
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,144
that's when we really
started noticing things

79
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,013
going on that
we could not explain.

80
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,282
- Do you think he caused it?
- Yes.

81
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,819
Nothing happened here
until he was born.

82
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,288
What type of experiences
are you guys having?

83
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,457
We've heard voices.

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,094
We have seen things
move on their own.

85
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,631
We've seen shadow figures.

86
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,699
We'll have nightmares,

87
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,036
and it's finally
getting physical.

88
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,640
We are...scared.

89
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,108
Now, is everybody in the house
being affected?

90
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,410
To some degree.

91
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,247
But it seems like
I'm the one that's seeing

92
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,617
and hearing
the majority of it.

93
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,385
So why don't you just move?

94
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,254
We just really love this place,

95
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,090
and I want to fight
for what's ours.

96
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,732
Something going on here.

97
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:05,270
There is a vortex here,
but it's huge.

98
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:09,641
It's massive.

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,679
Dead people can come and go
through it, also beings,

100
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,815
entities, like, things
that have never been human.

101
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:22,621
It's very concentrated
energy, very focused.

102
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:27,559
This is too much energy for
living people to be exposed to.

103
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,496
Being near this vortex
can cause a lot

104
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,300
of physical issues
with the living.

105
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,435
You're not gonna be
able to sleep here.

106
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,038
You're gonna have...
insane dreams here.

107
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,706
You're gonna lose time here.

108
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,408
You're gonna see crazy...

109
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,313
It's not okay to be
in this location at all.

110
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,623
What's going on down here?

111
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:03,929
I was down here one day,
and I go to walk up the stairs.

112
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:09,200
I see the bottom half of
an apparition as plain as day.

113
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,869
Where were you
when you saw this?

114
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,403
At the back door.

115
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,372
Any chance it could've
been one of the kids?

116
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,074
They were upstairs.

117
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,678
After I saw the apparition,
I got this intense pain.

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,882
It felt like lightning had went
from my head to my toes.

119
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,216
All right. So what else?

120
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,720
I have heard, say, two people
having a conversation,

121
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,823
whispering, almost like
they didn't want me

122
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,391
to hear what they were saying.

123
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,293
Does it sound like
it's a man and a woman,

124
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,828
a couple of men,
couple of women?

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,897
It varies. I've heard all.

126
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,165
Could the TV be on upstairs,

127
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,267
and it's just filtering
down into --

128
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,302
There is no television
on at these times.

129
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,637
This was late at night.

130
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,173
We don't leave TVs on.

131
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,674
Okay.
What else is going on?

132
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,910
One night, it was, like,

133
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,881
someone was shaking
the door violently.

134
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,315
Could somebody have
gotten into the garage?

135
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,552
That was my first thought,
and I was ready to call 9-1-1.

136
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,086
Did you investigate it?

137
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,622
I actually was too scared.

138
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,596
Wow.

139
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,732
There's Native Americans.

140
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,802
This is theirs, man.

141
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,536
I honestly thought
they were all men,

142
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,672
but I'm seeing all of these
Native American women

143
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,641
here with children.

144
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:26,010
I think that the living would
have experiences of feeling,

145
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:31,015
like, back it up.

146
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,686
I think that the living

147
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,289
would have a hard time

148
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,758
being down here for very long.

149
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,229
They would definitely
have experiences,

150
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,698
hearing children
laughing and playing,

151
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,834
hearing women's voices.

152
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,768
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

153
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:59,610
The Native Americans are
constantly, like, moving things.

154
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,381
They don't want anything
down here or person,

155
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,450
and it really
bothers them, you know?

156
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,451
They want it all out.

157
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,760
Okay. So what's going on?

158
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:20,332
The other night, I had a dream
that there was a man

159
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,200
that was chasing me

160
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,168
down the stairs
with a knife.

161
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,703
Okay. How often are you
having those?

162
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,205
Several times a month.

163
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,206
All right.
Listen, I have nightmares.

164
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,174
Why is it paranormal for you?

165
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,878
These nightmares have just
started this year

166
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,747
when the activity
really started ramping up.

167
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,284
And I've never had nightmares
like this before.

168
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,053
Okay. All right.
What else is going on in here?

169
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:46,157
One night, I woke up
and there was just a shadow

170
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,825
leaning over me.

171
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,027
Where was the shadow?

172
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,828
It was along that wall
right there.

173
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,498
It couldn't have been somebody
outside casting a shadow.
No, no.

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,767
At nighttime, I always
shut our blinds.

175
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,836
Bad dreams.
Seeing shadow figures in here.

176
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,171
What else is going on?

177
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,107
There is times that
I've woke up, that it feels like

178
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,942
I've been in a car accident.

179
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,812
It feels like someone has taken
a baseball bat to my ribcage.

180
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,615
Do you ever see
any markings from it?

181
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,850
- We've taken some pictures.
- Okay.

182
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,253
This is my calf.

183
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,922
I mean, this is bad.
You know that.
Yeah.

184
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,457
Anything else physical
like that ever happened?

185
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,058
I'll go to bed feeling fine.

186
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,927
I will wake up in the middle
of the night

187
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,197
and have a migraine to where
it will make me so sick,

188
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,066
to where I'll get nauseous,

189
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,002
my head just feels like
somebody has just caved it in.

190
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,737
How the hell are you
living like this?

191
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,940
It's really scary sometimes.

192
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,076
And I'm just trying
to get through it,

193
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,012
make everything
okay for my boys,

194
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,683
my husband and just
try to block it out.

195
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:53,691
I see a woman here
with straight dark hair.

196
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,159
Is this a living person?

197
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,096
I think it's a living person.

198
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,833
I feel like she's being
beat up, like,

199
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,036
physically assaulted
by a dead male.

200
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,943
She's, like, praying and crying
and praying and crying.

201
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,880
This person in here
is sick already

202
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,018
and is sicker
because of living here

203
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,521
because it's such a bad
place to be physically.

204
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,577
- So, Lane, how old are you?
- I'm 13.

205
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,912
So I was talking to mom.

206
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:51,049
She says things in the house
are pretty scary.
Yes.

207
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,550
Are you having trouble
sleeping here?

208
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,885
I've had nightmares in here,

209
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,654
and that's caused me
to not sleep.

210
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,357
So, Lane, what have you seen
that you can't explain?

211
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,394
Downstairs, I saw the rocking
chair rocking by itself.

212
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,129
Now, Lane, is it possible
one of your dogs

213
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,465
might have ran by
the chair and hit it?

214
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,000
No, because it's only happened

215
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,734
whenever I'm down
there long.

216
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,802
Okay. What else?

217
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,539
One time, I saw a dark
figure standing

218
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,075
right there looking at me
through the doorway.

219
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,344
It scared me so bad, my heart
just, like, leapt out of me.

220
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,880
So what did you see?
What did it look like?

221
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,414
Like a man.

222
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,817
It was, like,
darker than the room.

223
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,286
Do you think what's here
could be dangerous?

224
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,655
Yeah.

225
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,923
Boy.

226
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,091
I'm seeing a group of men.

227
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,627
They look weird.

228
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,029
They're dressed up
like pirates or bandits.

229
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,767
It makes them look
really creepy,

230
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,505
but they're all in shadow except
their eyes are white, like,

231
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,041
this intense,
bright, white light

232
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,445
comes out of their eyes
and puts them into shadow.

233
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,447
Living people here
are seeing them.

234
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,684
They wake up at night,
and they're being stared at.

235
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,119
Very scary.

236
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,093
Mark, talking to your wife,
she said that the activity

237
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,528
kind of started

238
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,963
maybe two years after
your youngest son was born.

239
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,965
I mean, did that
make sense to you?

240
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,134
Yes.

241
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,336
There is something going on
with the youngest.

242
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,205
Any experiences you could
tell me about?

243
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,606
Absolutely. Yeah.

244
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,876
We were all down
in the kitchen.
Okay.

245
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,011
And there was this
real loud beep.

246
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,513
It was really, I mean, you know,
it made your ears ring.

247
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,282
Now, Mark, smoke detectors
make that noise

248
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,284
when the battery
is starting to go.

249
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,519
Was that the case here?

250
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,556
I searched everything down
there, I mean, everything.

251
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,824
There was nothing.

252
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,993
Nothing logical
could explain it.

253
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,427
Okay. Anything else happen?

254
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,064
One time, I came in and fell
asleep on the love seat

255
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,833
and had my head back.

256
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,202
And it just felt like
somebody grabbed my jaw

257
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,704
and slammed it shut.

258
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,772
- You sure it wasn't a dream?
- Yeah.

259
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,444
And then afterward,
the bottom of my chin tingled

260
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,079
and then my teeth
started hurting.

261
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,848
I'm like, "Holy crap."
I mean, it hurt my teeth.

262
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,051
Working with Amy, knowing that
things are really physical here,

263
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:10,088
this is not a good thing.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,923
I worry every day, especially
when I'm out of town.

265
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,491
It's tough.

266
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:17,128
I'm really worried about
the boys being mentally scarred.

267
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,000
These pirate bandit people

268
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,636
are causing a lot
of stress for the living.

269
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,406
One of them tried to talk to me.

270
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:33,310
It made this weird noise.

271
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,215
I've seen them, like,
creeping up on a male here

272
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,116
as he's going up these stairs,

273
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,219
and there's a little dead guy

274
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,355
jumping on this
living dude's back.

275
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:48,293
This living guy just explodes.

276
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,761
He's feeling choked.

277
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,896
He's feeling like the wind's
being knocked out of him.

278
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,064
He's feeling pushed.

279
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,199
A lot of really
brutal experiences.

280
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,741
- Tanner, how old are you?
-10.

281
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,109
So, Tanner, when I was
talking to your mom today,

282
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,778
she told me that you were
having a tough time

283
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,513
with the activity in the house.

284
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,482
- Does that sound right to you?
- Yeah.

285
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,384
Any experiences
you could tell me about?

286
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,622
In the TV room,
the ceiling fan light,

287
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:23,161
it was off then
it flickered on by itself.

288
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,496
- That kind of scared you.
- Yeah.

289
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,764
Anything else?

290
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,067
I had a headache that

291
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,739
progressively got stronger.

292
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,542
And you think this was caused
by the paranormal?

293
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,010
Yeah.

294
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,812
Did you have them ever again?

295
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:41,879
Yes.

296
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,681
Your mom mentioned
she gets headaches.

297
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,749
You ever been around mom
when she got them?

298
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,684
Yeah.

299
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:50,288
I got them the same time
as she did.

300
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,223
If things are so bad here
for everybody else

301
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,893
and they've got to move,
would you be okay with that?

302
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,895
Yeah.

303
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,568
There is about
two or three women here.

304
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,636
I think they're whores.

305
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,372
I guess they probably had
Syphilis, I'm thinking.

306
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,640
They're rotting.

307
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,576
One of them doesn't
have a nose, you know?

308
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,378
The other one is, like,
missing, you know,

309
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,679
pretty much her whole face.

310
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,548
And they look scarier than...

311
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,889
You know if they interact with

312
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,090
the living in any way?

313
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,194
These whores are pulling
memories out.

314
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,863
I think that the living
have headaches from that,

315
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,865
and I think that they have
nightmares from that.

316
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,533
It's very unhealthy.

317
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:45,376
They like this room.

318
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,613
They're attracted to this
living person here

319
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,549
'cause they're
a physical medium.

320
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,952
These whores think that this
person has been neglected.

321
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,289
They basically want
to adopt this person.

322
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,158
- Is this person in danger?
- Yeah.

323
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,094
The whores have been
attached to this person

324
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,262
for their whole life
and make bad...

325
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:10,301
happen, and they can kill
the living person here.

326
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,801
Look, Elkview is a tiny town,
barely over 1,200 people.

327
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,469
So when I made my usual calls,

328
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:31,439
just about everyone knew
Sara and Mark's property.

329
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,307
I'm heading over to meet
with an archivist who says,

330
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,809
one of the original owners

331
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,711
suffered a lot
of tragedies there.

332
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,617
Now, Matt, you mentioned
on the phone

333
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,386
that the Pauley family
suffered some tragedies

334
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,255
while they were on
my clients' property.

335
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,089
When did they get
my clients' property?

336
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,827
Daniel Pauley bought your
clients' property in about 1858.

337
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,762
So how much property
did he have?

338
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,898
Well, he purchased 670 acres.

339
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,333
Wow.

340
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,602
Does he move on the property
right then and there?
Yes. Yes.

341
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,270
He and his wife, Cinthya,
and their eight children,

342
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,207
they moved their immediately
and built a house.

343
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,676
You mentioned on the phone,
there were some deaths

344
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,911
in regards to the family.
What happened?

345
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,748
Cinthya gives birth to
a baby boy named Benjamin.

346
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,018
But unfortunately, Benjamin dies
when he's only 4 months old.

347
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,287
4 months?

348
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,089
Yeah, same year they move
onto the property.

349
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,490
This is the death record of it?

350
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,091
- That's right.
- What happens after that?

351
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,259
Several years later,

352
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,328
the American Civil War is
going on.

353
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,631
Daniel goes off
to fight for the North.

354
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,499
I mean, how old is
he at this point?
He's 50.

355
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,368
All right.
So let me get this straight.

356
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,304
The guy's 50,
joins the Union Army.

357
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,438
That's correct.

358
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,973
And we do know that the company
he served in lost

359
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,711
about 200 men to disease,
probably dysentery.

360
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:45,780
And a lot of that was due
to the, you know,

361
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:48,182
the sanitation conditions.

362
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,051
So in these camps, it just was
not a very healthy place to be.

363
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:55,990
And that's
a horrible way to go.
Yes.

364
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,126
I'm seeing that
group of bandits,

365
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:01,495
and they don't look good.

366
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,464
They all got sick,
and they all died

367
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,500
horrible deaths
from this illness.

368
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,203
And they are damned
to wander here.

369
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,509
The leader of these bandits

370
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,413
is a colonial rogue soldier.

371
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,948
So can you describe this guy?

372
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,685
He looks to be in his 40s,
I would guess,

373
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,154
very tall and he had on this

374
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:31,526
very rich velvet blue

375
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,360
Military jacket.

376
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,098
He was in the military,
and I believe he went rogue.

377
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:44,105
How does it go for him
after that?

378
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,574
He's able to come home
to Cinthya and the children

379
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:50,278
unscathed at the end
of the war in 1865.

380
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,783
As time wears on, though,
on October 5, 1888, he dies.

381
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,051
- Do we know how old he was?
- Yes.

382
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,253
He was 73 years old.

383
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,521
Okay.
What are we thinking, stroke?

384
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,790
More than likely a stroke.

385
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,925
All right.
So Daniel is dead.

386
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,294
Does Cinthya remain
on the property?

387
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,462
She does, and she
winds up dying in

388
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,131
February of 1890
when she's 72.

389
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,334
- And on my clients' property?
- That's correct.

390
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,802
What happens with the property?

391
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,804
Well, it stays in the family
and it is Daniel's grandson,

392
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,541
George, who actually
buys the property.

393
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:25,412
In 1894, he and his wife
have a young son named Romey

394
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,482
who dies before
he's even a year old.

395
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:29,884
What happens after that?

396
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,820
Well, George actually
is the final chapter

397
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,889
of the Pauley tragedies.

398
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,824
In 1906, when he's
only 36 years old,

399
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,428
he dies very quickly,
very mysteriously.

400
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,500
All we have to go on
is his obituary.

401
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,569
So we don't know if it was
an accident, illness.

402
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,471
It doesn't tell us
what happened to him.

403
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,473
But we do know
it was very unexpected.

404
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,145
I think there are so many
dead people here

405
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:01,115
because of the vortex.

406
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,986
Dead people can come
and go through it, also beings,

407
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,688
entities, like, things
that have never been human.

408
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,325
They can come and go through it.

409
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:14,395
And how would the living
be affected by the vortex?

410
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:16,597
They would feel anxious.

411
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,500
They would have
equilibrium issues.

412
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:23,203
It could cause
long-term illnesses,

413
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,872
also neurological damage.

414
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,676
This thing is really dangerous.

415
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,745
I think that it can kill people.

416
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,318
A local EMT just called me.

417
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,021
Now, he says Elkview has been
completely flooded

418
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,789
several times.

419
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,558
It turns out, one of the most
recent ones was deadly,

420
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,960
and one of the victims died

421
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,361
right near
Mark and Sara's house.

422
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:55,902
Now, Tim,
thanks for meeting me.

423
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,339
I really appreciate that.

424
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,041
You mentioned on the phone that
one of my clients' neighbors

425
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:03,577
perished during this big flood.
What happened?

426
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,512
Little Sandy Creek
runs along the property

427
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,448
that you're investigating.

428
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,218
In June of 1998, a big powerful
storm hit the Elkview area.

429
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,054
Okay. So how bad did it get?

430
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:16,057
İt got pretty deep, and it
destroyed a lot of property

431
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,558
and took some lives.

432
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,927
Wow. All right.

433
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,795
So obviously, the water rose.

434
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,265
What were the flood levels
at my clients' property?

435
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:27,101
Wow.
It got really high.
Okay.

436
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:28,669
So what do we know
about the poor guy

437
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,071
that died in this flood?

438
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,406
Well, Mr. Richard Varium, he was
an 83-year-old guy that lived

439
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,607
about 1,000 feet from
the property

440
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:34,942
you're investigating.

441
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,010
I have a picture of Mr. Varium
when he was younger.

442
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:41,148
He had been living alone
for quite a while.

443
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,852
He was bound to a wheelchair
and also blind.

444
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:46,887
He was in a bad situation.

445
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,322
What happened?

446
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:51,525
Family tried to get him out,
and they got him to the porch

447
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,861
and realized that the water
was too swift, muddy,

448
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:56,097
with a lot of debris
and then went to get help.

449
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,898
By the time they got back,

450
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,100
he had washed away
along with the porch.

451
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,502
And he was found
downstream about 1/4

452
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,604
of a mile in some trees.

453
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,747
There was something about
water issues here and flooding

454
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,351
'cause I saw water
come down, like, a wall.

455
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,859
These water issues
are due directly

456
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:28,462
to the paranormal
phenomena here.

457
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:31,065
That's not good.

458
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:33,334
The problem here is the land.

459
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:38,538
Exposure to the land
seems to trap the dead here

460
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,143
or bring them back
to be trapped here.

461
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,283
For more information
about the show

462
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,887
and if you need us to
investigate unexplained activity

463
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:53,954
in your home...

464
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,157
Please visit
travelchannel.com/thedeadfiles.

465
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,492
Click on
"Help Me, Dead Files!"

466
00:22:58,494 --> 00:22:59,994
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

467
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,889
So far, I've got a family
being tormented

468
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,827
in their own home on a property
where at least five people died.

469
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,264
But I want to see
if there is anything else.

470
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,299
Searching through old records,

471
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,402
I find an article about another
member of the Pauley family.

472
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,439
It turns out he was murdered
right next to Sara

473
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,175
and Mark's property.

474
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,110
I'm heading over to meet
historian and old friend,

475
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,711
Jim Casto.

476
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,647
He's looked into
this case for me

477
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,483
and says it's got all
the ingredients for violence --

478
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,552
friendship, love, and betrayal.

479
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,426
Well, Jim, it's good
to see you again.

480
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,496
Now, the homicide, it happened
right near my clients' property,

481
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,298
and it involved
one of the Pauleys.

482
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,665
So what can you
tell me about it?

483
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,536
The victim was 27-year-old
Clarence Pauley,

484
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,439
and he and his wife
and his three kids lived

485
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,775
just down the road
from the property.

486
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,078
There is a photo of him
in his Navy uniform

487
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,581
during his World War II service.

488
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,849
Despite being a married man,

489
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,286
Clarence was
conducting an affair

490
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,255
with the wife
of his best friend,

491
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,592
Arnold Eldgewick,
and her name was Mary.

492
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,127
What happened with
the homicide?

493
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:29,266
On the night of
May 27, 1947,

494
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,403
Clarence drove Mary
to her sister's house,

495
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,538
where she had been staying.
- Okay.

496
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,977
What they didn't know was that
Arnold was there waiting on them

497
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,981
in the dark, shotgun in hand.

498
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,318
They pulled up.
Mary saw him standing there.

499
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,719
She got out of the car.

500
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:52,289
He fired a shotgun blast
to her but missed.

501
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,525
She fled and went down the road.

502
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,093
Clarence gets out of the car.

503
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,595
But before he gets
out of the car,

504
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:00,964
he picks up a heavy hammer
and he starts toward Arnold.

505
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,733
The guy's got a shotgun,
and he grabs a hammer?

506
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,802
- It seems odd.
- Yeah.

507
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,904
Arnold fired again.

508
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,706
This time, his shot
hit its mark.

509
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,110
It pierced Clarence's chest
right into his heart.

510
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,248
He died instantly.

511
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,050
Okay.
So Arnold kills this guy.

512
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,318
Do the cops arrest him?

513
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,787
Well, they didn't have
to bother looking for him.

514
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,491
He drove himself straight
to the county jail,

515
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,394
turned himself in,
confessed what he had done.

516
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,529
And when they asked
him why, he said,

517
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,798
"I thought I had
done a good deed."

518
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,402
Here is a mug shot taken
at the West Virginia prison.

519
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,005
He's got psycho
written in his eyes.

520
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,006
I can tell you that.

521
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,340
- Absolutely.
- All right.

522
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,275
So how much time
did he wind up getting?

523
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,978
He served three years
in the West Virginia State Pen.

524
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,915
He got away with pretty
much premeditated murder.

525
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,215
So it would seem.

526
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,958
Something happened where
this woman is freaking out.

527
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,693
I'm hearing, like, men's voices
talking, yelling.

528
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,902
Some jealousy issues,
I heard a gunshot.

529
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:18,242
I'm getting just
a lot of sadness.

530
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,387
I saw a lot of dead
during my walk,

531
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,790
but two groups
concerned me the most.

532
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,025
First, the gang of bandits,

533
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,195
these figures
are completely black.

534
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,832
Their eyes were white.

535
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:47,670
They look like kind of
these mutant monsters.

536
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:52,743
Next, I describe the prostitutes
terrorizing a young boy.

537
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,210
He is pissed off.

538
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:59,283
He's like this because
they keep him up all night.

539
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,086
One of them is kind of
missing half of her face.

540
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,187
It's been rotted off already.

541
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,956
The other one,
her nose fell off.

542
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,499
Amy, is this what you saw?

543
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,902
Yes. That's what I saw.

544
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,891
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

545
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,893
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

546
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,429
and our clients
for the first time.

547
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,298
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Sara and her husband, Mark.

548
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,968
Now, they live here
with their two young sons.

549
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,303
I've got a photo.

550
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,571
This is Lane, who is 13.

551
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,340
This is Tanner, who's 10.

552
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,776
Now, Mark here travels
a lot for work,

553
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,378
so Sara and the boys
are left here a lot

554
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,580
to face the violent
activity alone.

555
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,149
She told me,
with everything going on,

556
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,317
this place is just
a house, not a home.

557
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,954
But they're both hoping
we can change that.

558
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,523
So now that Amy
has met you guys,

559
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,327
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

560
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,862
When I got here,

561
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:23,800
I saw something
that is really not good

562
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,671
for living people --
a vortex.

563
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,074
It's something that's
always been here,

564
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:34,077
and this one is so large
and is very powerful.

565
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,879
People who live in areas
like this

566
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,215
will have a lot
of paranormal phenomena

567
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:43,554
because entities and dead people
come and go through vortexes.

568
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:48,492
The dead here, due to this
kind of energy, are stronger.

569
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,894
They're gonna be
much more physical.

570
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:55,065
They're gonna be able to do
a lot more to the living.

571
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:59,035
And for the living, it makes
you guys a lot weaker.

572
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,371
If you have a lot of
dead people around you,

573
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,907
you're gonna have
a lot of dead energy

574
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,510
which isn't
particularly healthy.

575
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:11,181
And also, because the movement
of energy is so intense,

576
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,051
the living here would be,
like, constantly falling,

577
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:17,454
having vertigo-type
experiences.

578
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,057
Now, we never talked about
equilibrium problems.

579
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,261
You or anybody in the family
have any problems with that?
Yes.

580
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,463
Months ago, it was just, like,

581
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,732
someone had spun me
around 50 times.

582
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,536
I could not get out
of the bathroom.

583
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,873
This vortex can also cause you
to have nightmares

584
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,742
and bad anxiety.

585
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:43,013
I feel high, high anxiety
for no reason.

586
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,416
Mark, do you or the boys
feel that way at all?

587
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:49,453
- The boys definitely do --
- Okay.

588
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,421
...especially Lane.

589
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,124
Plus,
you mentioned nightmares.
Yeah.

590
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,759
You feel like when you wake up,

591
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,161
you have to look
around to be like,

592
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,029
"Where the heck have I been?"

593
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,898
And I spoke to both boys,

594
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,901
and they're having
nightmare issues as well.-

595
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,571
Long-term, what is this
gonna do to us?

596
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:11,107
Being exposed to just
the vortex alone

597
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,110
on a consistent
basis can develop

598
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,581
into long-term
and terminal illnesses,

599
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,182
things like brain cancer,

600
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:23,820
dementia, Alzheimer's,
heart issues.

601
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,855
Do you guys suffer
from anything like that?

602
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,891
High blood pressure, yeah.

603
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,561
But it seems like it probably
got worse when I came here.

604
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,862
Exactly. That's the vortex?

605
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,331
It could be, yeah.

606
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,003
What else did you get?

607
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,540
There are three groups
of dead people here.

608
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:47,844
They are each from
a separate time period.

609
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,414
One of the groups
is Native American.

610
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,783
And basically, they've taken
over this basement area.

611
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,386
There is a lot of
physical phenomena.

612
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:01,325
Native Americans are constantly,
like, moving things.

613
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:05,361
They don't want anything
down here or person,

614
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,431
and it really
bothers them, you know?

615
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,233
They want it all out.

616
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,768
So I thought the living would
hear maybe the women talking,

617
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,906
the children laughing
and playing, objects moving.

618
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,374
When I spoke with Sara
down here in the basement,

619
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,011
she told me about hearing voices
down here, conversations, right?

620
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,445
Just whispers.
Imagine just people, you know...

621
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,184
Yeah, I'll hear that.

622
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,585
Now, you've also heard
someone screwing

623
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,987
with the basement doorknob.

624
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,588
Tell Amy what
happened that time.

625
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,025
Imagine somebody walking up
the stairs and can't get up,

626
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:38,594
got angry and just did
one of those.

627
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,196
Now, Mark, did Lane tell you
about the story

628
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,799
with the rocking
chair down here?

629
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,934
Yeah. Just out of
the corner of his eye,

630
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,338
he would see this
rocking chair move.

631
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,073
Now, does that make sense
with all

632
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,608
the Native Americans down here?

633
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,944
Yes.

634
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,348
There is one dead male
I saw very clearly.

635
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,351
He is the leader of
the second group

636
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,353
of dead people that are here,

637
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,757
and I'll get to those
guys in a minute.

638
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,894
This guy was extremely tall,
very thin, very pale.

639
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:14,630
He looked to be in his 40s.

640
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,767
He was wearing
an interesting hat.

641
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,170
He also had a royal blue

642
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,140
Military-style jacket.

643
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:27,644
I think he was in the military,
and he went rogue.

644
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,447
And like I said,
he had a team of men.

645
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,717
I mean, I kept calling them kind
of, like, pirates or bandits

646
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,586
because of how
they dressed and acted.

647
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,455
Eventually, though,
all of these men

648
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,791
became extremely ill
from some kind of illness,

649
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,695
and they all died
horrible deaths.

650
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,264
Some of the stuff you're talking
about reminds me

651
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,332
of one of the original
owners of your property,

652
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,269
and this guy goes back to 1858.

653
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:57,007
He bought 670 acres, including
the property the house sits on.

654
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,541
Now his name was Daniel Pauley.

655
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,677
Now, you said the guy you saw
was in the Military

656
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,013
and might have had
a Military jacket on?-

657
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,550
Pauley served in the Union Army
during the Civil War

658
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:10,220
which would have been
a blue uniform.

659
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,321
He was 50 years old
when he joined.

660
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,958
You said you saw a bunch of men
dying of some horrible illness.

661
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,961
Now, when Pauley was serving,

662
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,464
200 of the guys he served
with died of dysentery.

663
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,633
But he managed
to survive somehow.

664
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,836
Now, is it possible Pauley
could be the guy you saw?

665
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,503
I kind of think it's unlikely.

666
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,141
I didn't really feel
like they lived here.

667
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,343
Okay.
At least we know who it's not.

668
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,812
Now, does this guy in blue
and his men do anything

669
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,714
to the living here?
- Yes.

670
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,316
I think you might hear them

671
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,054
and I tried to speak to them.

672
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:47,724
But because they can't
physically manifest words,

673
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,193
this weird noise came out.

674
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,395
It's like this crackling
weird noise.

675
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,529
Well, it's funny
you mention that

676
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,598
because I just looked at Mark.

677
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,800
He told me about hearing
these, like, a beep?

678
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,004
Yeah, just a beep
out of nowhere.

679
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,505
It sounds like it's right
next to you,

680
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,142
but there is nothing there.

681
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:09,012
I got that there is one male
that they don't particularly

682
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:13,683
like here, that they do focus
on and pick on often.

683
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,753
One of them attacked
this male here.

684
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:21,024
I saw him jumping on his back,
pushing him up the stairs

685
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:24,261
there into
the family room area,

686
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:29,733
maybe feeling, like, an,
you know, a hit here maybe,

687
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,236
maybe choking sensation,
maybe feeling like, you know,

688
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,606
the wind's getting
knocked out of you.

689
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,708
It sounds to me like
you're talking about Mark.

690
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,076
Tell her about the experience
you had on the couch

691
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,511
'cause that was pretty bad.

692
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:45,281
One night, okay, my mouth was
wide open and I was snoring.

693
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,317
And it just felt like
somebody had come up

694
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,286
and took their hand
and slammed my mouth shut.

695
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,957
And the bottom side of my chin

696
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,126
tingled for at least
an hour or two.

697
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,962
You mentioned you'd saw
a male getting attacked.

698
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,198
- Yeah.
- But I got news for you.

699
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,536
I got photos of Sara
waking up with bruises.

700
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,206
Here, look at these.

701
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,340
Wow.

702
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:16,646
It feels like somebody has taken
a baseball bat to my ribcage.

703
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,481
Is there any other way
Mark and Sara

704
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,083
would experience these guys?

705
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:23,520
It's possible that the living
could see them.

706
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:28,258
They were in shadow and I had
a sketch done of what I saw.

707
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:38,835
Wow.

708
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:43,573
Wow.

709
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,976
I have seen a dark apparition,

710
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,247
a shadow figure,
that I thought was Mark,

711
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:53,183
and he backed into the wall.

712
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,652
So it sounds like these bandits
are what they're seeing?

713
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,221
Correct.
These guys are always around.

714
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:02,725
They don't ever leave.

715
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,661
You said there were three
groups of dead people

716
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,895
you were concerned about.
- Yeah.

717
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,731
What was the third one?

718
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,066
So there is this other group
of dead people

719
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,469
that are here
that are prostitutes.

720
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,705
There's two or three of them.

721
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:20,276
I think that these women
suffered from syphilis.

722
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,113
For instance,
one doesn't have a nose.

723
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,516
There is another one
who has the sores.

724
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,352
It can be a rotting disease.

725
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,354
As far as what the living
would experience,

726
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,155
they will go into your minds

727
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,661
and pull out
really bad memories,

728
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,097
causing wicked headaches
and nightmares.

729
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,199
You and Tanner
both have headaches.

730
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,070
I mean, we're talking
full-blown migraine to where,

731
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,639
you know, you're nauseous.

732
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:54,477
The other thing that's going
on is, they love children.

733
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,747
They wanted the child
who's in the yellow room.

734
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,449
That's Tanner.

735
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:04,220
They're attracted to him
because he is a physical medium.

736
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,127
A lot of this activity started
after Tanner hit about 2.

737
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:12,996
Is there a connection
between him turning 2

738
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,799
and what's going on here?
- Yes.

739
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:20,002
He's becoming a little bit
more cognizant, you know, aware.

740
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,538
So he can interact
with them in a way

741
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,675
that a lot of other
people can't.

742
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,443
You didn't have a surprised
look on your face

743
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,678
when she said he was
a physical medium.

744
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,747
You were like, "Yeah."

745
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,149
- We kind of suspected it.
- You did?

746
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,352
Yeah. I'm really worried
about him because ---

747
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,621
...what's his life
going to be like

748
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,022
and what do we tell him now?

749
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,957
He strikes me as a kid,
when you talk to him,

750
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,994
as somebody that has
been through a lot.

751
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,162
A lot, exactly.

752
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,499
I did have a sketch done of him

753
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,336
being agitated by these women.

754
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,978
That's gonna be tough
for you to see.

755
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,579
Wow.

756
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,953
I mean, I've seen him sit
in his bed like that.

757
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,356
You can tell that
something bothers him.

758
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,591
All right.

759
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,727
So what do these prostitutes
want with Tanner anyway?

760
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,462
These women are nuts.

761
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,065
What they're trying
to figure out right now

762
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:26,068
is if they want to take him

763
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,606
or if they want to
attach to him.

764
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,475
And if they were
to attach to him,

765
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:36,345
they would then cause
issues throughout his life.

766
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:40,950
If they decided to take him,
that would result in death.

767
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,604
So Sara and Mark, you guys got
a lot of information tonight,

768
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:05,041
probably a lot more
than you bargained for.

769
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,576
But we still haven't
answered the big question.

770
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,546
Is there anything you can do
to stop the activity here

771
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,914
so that you guys can protect

772
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:15,585
Tanner and live in peace
as a family again?

773
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:20,390
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

774
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,458
Okay. So here we go.

775
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,628
Basically, what can be done
about the vortex

776
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,131
is a reversal
of the vortex energy.

777
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,701
Take it from negative
to positive.

778
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,805
That way, the entities aren't
anymore coming out at you.

779
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,775
They're going in,
and then they're moving on.

780
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,744
And negative energy
would dissipate over time.

781
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,913
So how can they make
that happen?

782
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,948
The one that I know,
she is a psychic knower

783
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,517
and a Reiki master.

784
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,851
Okay.

785
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:52,288
And she also specializes
in working with vortex.

786
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,090
It's an extremely
difficult task.

787
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,927
I would give the odds 50/50.

788
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:02,464
You'll know within a week, after
the practitioner were to leave,

789
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,601
if it worked or not.

790
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:08,170
Obviously, if it doesn't take,
I would recommend that you move.

791
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:16,679
If it did work, then you would
need to find a physical medium

792
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,883
and a shaman to move on the rest
of the dead that are here,

793
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,953
the ones who think
that they're trapped.

794
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,089
What about the whores?

795
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,325
They're gonna be
harder to grasp,

796
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,361
but the medium
will be able to do it.

797
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:37,166
Yeah. They're not gonna have
another chance to kill my kid.

798
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:42,405
They are not harming him
ever, ever, ever again.

799
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,841
Even if all of this works,
you have to start dealing

800
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,444
and learning about
the abilities that your son,

801
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,247
Tanner, has, especially
focusing right now

802
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:55,251
on protection measures
and meditation techniques.

803
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,253
If you were in their shoes,
what would you do?

804
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,356
- I would be out of here.
- Shoot.

805
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,392
If they move and Tanner learns
how to deal with his abilities,

806
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:07,463
should they be okay?
- Yeah.

807
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,399
You know, normally,
I stick it to the clients.

808
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:11,935
I'm like, "You're gonna do
what Amy advises you."

809
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,203
This is one of those cases
where it's, like, you guys

810
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,005
really got to figure this out

811
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,673
and, you know,
this is your family.

812
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,609
Not a tough decision
when it comes

813
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,345
to the well-being of the family.

814
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,615
- This is just a physical place.
- Yeah.

815
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:26,749
I don't see how we can stay.

816
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,553
We're definitely
gonna move.

817
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,689
There is no guarantee
that a psychic knower

818
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,625
and a Reiki master
can reverse the vortex on Mark

819
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,160
and Sara's property,

820
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:41,263
so I really hope they take
my advice and move.

821
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,901
If they do that and teach Tanner
how to deal with his abilities,

822
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,903
they should be able to
lead a peaceful life.
