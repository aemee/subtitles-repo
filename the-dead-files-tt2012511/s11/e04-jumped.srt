1
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,678
Over here is really bad.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,147
It breeds psychopaths.

3
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,384
I've been jumped.

4
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,386
He is breaking her neck.

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,590
I had to get out of the building
as quickly as I possibly could.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,327
The dead can't rest.

7
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,462
I'm convinced it was
a homicide.

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,232
He likes killing people.

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,768
This is not a good situation.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,669
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,238
There's death here.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,973
Don't wanna go down there.

13
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,241
I see dead people.

14
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,343
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

15
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:47,112
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,848
She's definitely
a serial killer.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,717
...and they speak to me.

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,852
She's going to torture them.

19
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:57,589
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,725
They were all murdered.

21
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,226
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,828
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,629
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,365
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,935
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:14,940
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

27
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,642
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,277
Who do you think
possessed you?

29
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,446
But Steve and I
never speak...

30
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,514
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,748
...until the very end.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,350
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,452
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

34
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,987
<i>Hell,</i> no.

35
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,589
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,591
Everyone is in jeopardy.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,007
I'm out here
in Sauk Centre, Minnesota.

38
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,877
It's about 100 miles northwest
of Minneapolis.

39
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,645
I got called in
by a woman named Kelley.

40
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,481
Now she thought she was
doing a good thing for her town

41
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,750
by buying and restoring
an historic hotel.

42
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,952
But no good deed
goes unpunished.

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,154
Activity in the building
is out of control,

44
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,758
but she says she's not leaving
no matter what,

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,195
so it's up to me and Amy
to find a solution.

46
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,368
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

47
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,105
of any leading information.

48
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,639
This is a large space,

49
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,444
and there are a lot of
historical photos and antiques.

50
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:29,514
I need to cover or remove each
and every one of them.

51
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,685
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,967
There's, like,
a dead guy here.

53
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,203
He's, like, being a stalker.

54
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:56,274
All you see is a skeleton
with, like, sharp teeth,

55
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,543
and he has a woman,
and he's holding her

56
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,246
by the back
of her head and neck.

57
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,687
He indicated that he murdered
her along with others.

58
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,656
He is a killer.

59
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,531
So, Kelley, when we spoke
on the phone,

60
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,633
you sounded really upset

61
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,201
about the things that are
happening here.

62
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,037
I'm really glad you're here.

63
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,507
The Palmer house is
so incredibly important to me.

64
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,377
I want it to be here
for generations to come,

65
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,580
and with the type of activity
that's going on,

66
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,683
it's become a real concern,

67
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:42,454
and now I begin to wonder
if it's even safe.

68
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,590
What are some of
the experiences
people are having?

69
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,192
There's been a lot of things
that are going on,

70
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,227
hearing footsteps,

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,696
objects being moved,

72
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,867
shadow figures,
and, in some cases,

73
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,137
people are being
touched and pushed.

74
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,540
I got to think, with all
the activity that's going on,

75
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,075
it's got to be bad
for business.

76
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,644
I definitely think
it is.

77
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,847
I've had guests that
have left.

78
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,917
It's frequent enough that
I actually created these binders

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,686
for guests to be able

80
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:19,725
to write their experiences down
themselves if they would like.

81
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,897
I got to tell you, this is
pretty interesting stuff.

82
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,700
What about employees?
Are they being affected?

83
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,902
I've had employees
that have quit

84
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,706
and mood shifts happen.
- Okay.

85
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,509
They can become
very quarrelsome,

86
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,245
very argumentative
with one another.

87
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,414
And you think that has something
to do with what's going on here?

88
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,316
I definitely think
it is.

89
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,619
Is it affecting you at all?

90
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,855
Sometimes,
I feel a little anxious

91
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:54,125
and really angry
and short-tempered,

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,396
but I can't imagine my life
anywhere but here.

93
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,731
It has my heart.

94
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,934
I love it with every fiber
of my being.

95
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,138
I want to make it work,
but I need it to be safe.

96
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,545
I walk in here
and my stomach drops,

97
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,349
and I hear a woman
crying and screaming.

98
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,188
This living woman,
she's just losing her...

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,160
The killer,
the skeleton face dude,

100
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,431
he's making me feel
extremely stressed out.

101
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,304
Also, the living people here
will feel,

102
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,207
sudden, extreme nausea

103
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,576
and projectile vomiting.

104
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,150
Okay, Kelley.
So what's going gonna in here?

105
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,786
There's just sometimes
that I end up

106
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,523
getting really sick
with no explanation.

107
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,692
Okay. What kind of sick?
What are we talking about?

108
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,397
Extreme nausea and terrible,
terrible headaches.

109
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,533
When you're away from here,
does the symptoms go away?

110
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,401
Yes, they do.

111
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,669
Okay. Anything else?

112
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,006
There's many times
I'm hearing voices.

113
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,275
Okay.
So what kind of voices?

114
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,743
Male, female.

115
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,947
Sometimes, it's even children
laughing and playing.

116
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,949
Kelley, in the building here,
I can hear people outside.

117
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,419
I can hear people in the back,
here in the kitchen.

118
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,886
How do you know
it's not that?

119
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,023
There's many occasions
when it's happened,

120
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,194
and we're already closed
for the night.

121
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,963
Is there anything else
going on in here?

122
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,297
One time, actually,

123
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,234
when I was just passing
through the kitchen,

124
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,772
this bowl on the end here
flew 10 feet across the kitchen.

125
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,442
Well, this can't really
fall off of here.

126
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,845
You're damn lucky that
it's that and not a knife.

127
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,513
My feelings exactly.

128
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,988
I'm seeing this living woman

129
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,591
being pushed out of here.

130
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,664
But I'm hearing, "Thrown,"

131
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,268
and I see that the dead woman,

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,304
that the skeleton-face guy
killed,

133
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,174
is the one who's doing it.

134
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,577
I don't think she likes
women very much.

135
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,615
She's very tough.

136
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,719
She's able to physically
interact with the living.

137
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,122
And, yeah,
she doesn't like women.

138
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,830
Okay, Kelley.
What's going on down here?

139
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:51,369
There's a very,
very large black shadow

140
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,539
that I've seen down here
on multiple occasions.

141
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,908
Can you describe
what it looks like?

142
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,378
Extremely tall,
very broad-shouldered.

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,948
Because of the sheer size,
I tend to say man,

144
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,650
but I don't know.

145
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,518
You ever see him anyplace else
in the building?

146
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,021
Sometimes upstairs.

147
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,723
Okay.
Anything else going on?

148
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,791
Well, the reason
I called you in for help

149
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,595
was because I've been
jumped.

150
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,298
What do you mean?
Like a spirit jumped you?

151
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,501
- Yes.
- So what was the feeling like?

152
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:29,474
It was absolutely like
somebody had complete control

153
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,010
over my body.

154
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,346
Did you get a sense of who
or what it might be?

155
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,182
It felt like a man.

156
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,318
I don't think that he
particularly cared for me.

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,487
That was as intense
as it comes.

158
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,955
So what do you think
this thing wants?

159
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,156
You have any idea?

160
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,960
I sometimes wonder if
it just wants me to leave.

161
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,161
I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,763
You're going to fight this.

163
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,699
Every step of the way
for as long as I have to.

164
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,976
This guy with
the skeleton-like face,

165
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,778
I don't feel to comfortable here

166
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,381
because I feel like

167
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,584
I'm constantly having
to push him away from me

168
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:16,054
because he can jump people.

169
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,661
So are you saying
he's trying to jump you now?

170
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,630
Yes, he's been trying to jump me
the whole time, the whole night.

171
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,934
Do you have any idea
what he wants from the living?

172
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,271
He indicated that
now he's death,

173
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,539
and he's enjoying that.

174
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,674
He likes killing people,

175
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,177
and he would like
to continue doing that.

176
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,517
So, Wyatt, I understand
you live at the hotel.

177
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,787
- How long has that been?
- Been here around 7 months.

178
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:07,388
Do you think this place
is dangerous?

179
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,124
I wouldn't like to say
it was dangerous,

180
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,391
but there has definitely
been times

181
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,660
where I've been
a little worried.

182
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,994
Okay.
So if you're uncomfortable,

183
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,662
could I assume
you've had experiences?

184
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,397
A few of them, yeah.
Absolutely.

185
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,932
I hear these banging sounds.

186
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:20,735
It's almost like a 30-pound
weight is being dropped.

187
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,603
All right. So how do you know
it's not guests?

188
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,139
Steve, I've been in this
building when I absolutely know

189
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,376
there has been nobody else
in the building with me.

190
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,877
Okay. Anything else?

191
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,346
I was sleeping one night.

192
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:34,783
All of a sudden, I felt like
somebody had laid in my bed

193
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,017
and put their arm around me.
- All right.

194
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,753
So can you actually feel
this person net to you?

195
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,056
Yeah, and I could feel
the fingertips

196
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,457
run across my chest,

197
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,225
and as it's touching me,
I feel almost like

198
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,361
being shocked
by an electric fence.

199
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:47,629
What'd you do?

200
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,730
I actually had thought about
climbing out of my window.

201
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,766
I couldn't move, so I just
kind of laid there,

202
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,033
and I just
kind of closed my eyes

203
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,969
and just hoped that
it would go away.

204
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,371
All right.
So anything else?

205
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,739
So I went into the basement.

206
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,475
As quick as snapping my fingers,
something had entered me.

207
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,712
The insides of me, it was almost
like they had changed.

208
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,448
My emotional state had changed.

209
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,951
I felt like a sickness had just
kind of embedded inside of me.

210
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:13,254
I had to get out of the building
as quickly as I possibly could.

211
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,089
I know Kelley mentioned
about an experience she had

212
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,093
where she felt she actually got
physically jumped by a spirit,

213
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,928
and it sounds a lot like
what you're talking about.

214
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,430
You think that's what
happened to you?

215
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,766
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

216
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,001
So you're hearing noises
when people shouldn't be here.

217
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:29,204
You're getting something
crawling into bed with you.

218
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:31,339
You're getting...sounds like
jumped by a spirit

219
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,740
in the basement,

220
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,676
but yet you don't think
it's dangerous here.

221
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,913
Yeah, I can see why you'd think
that that would be a problem,

222
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,348
and, I, you know, sometimes,
it does worry me.

223
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,386
Are you not taking it
as serious as you should?

224
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:45,786
That's possible.

225
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:55,163
The skeleton-face dude, he is
very protective of this area,

226
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,332
so I think that he would

227
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,900
probably get physical
with the living down here

228
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,970
because he doesn't
want them down here.

229
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,406
Over here is really bad.

230
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:10,278
People would be pushed, hit,
slapped, punched.

231
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,046
I don't know how many people
he's actually had

232
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:15,717
to physically assault
to get them out of here.

233
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,620
It seems like he does more
of the killing upstairs.

234
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,995
Kelley is here all the time, and
you don't get here that often.

235
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,630
You know, with some of
the stuff she talked about,

236
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,998
it's pretty dangerous.
- Yeah. That's true.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,068
You know, the amount of time
she spends here, that scares me.

238
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,671
I'm concerned about something,
you know, jumping on.

239
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,073
I'm concerned about her
bringing something home.

240
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,943
- Have you had any experiences?
- Yeah.

241
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,411
We were downstairs with a group
of people and just really,

242
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,181
all of a sudden,
it just turned black,

243
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,083
couldn't really even see
the hand in front of your face.

244
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,785
It startled me.

245
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,287
Now you say you were
down there with a group.

246
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,788
- What are you talking about?
- There was an investigation.

247
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,691
All right, so you had
a paranormal investigative group

248
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,827
in the building.
- Yes.

249
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,463
Is that something
you regularly do here?
Yeah.

250
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:04,031
I gotta warn you,
Amy's not gonna like that.

251
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,866
All right.
So any other experiences?

252
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,769
Well, in this room,
I was here one evening,

253
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,972
and there was this sound
of glasses clanking together,

254
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:15,176
and a bottle on this back bar
just burst on its own.

255
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,445
I mean, is it possible that
bottle already had a crack in it

256
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,814
and just finally gave way?
- I suppose it's possible.

257
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,283
To me, was hard to explain.

258
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:25,019
I've learned one thing
from my partner is that

259
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,988
when things get physical
like they are here,

260
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,823
it's only gonna get worse.

261
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:35,930
Wow. Okay.
There's a lot of residual here.

262
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,932
A lot of residual.

263
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,201
Now this is going back,
and so I'm seeing,

264
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:45,073
like, people drinking,
partying, having a good time,

265
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:50,211
and this looks like
a<i> long</i> time ago.

266
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,648
So how might all this
residual affect living people?

267
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,483
Wouldn't be surprised
if the living are

268
00:13:55,485 --> 00:14:00,855
hearing the partying
from way back in the day --

269
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,758
glasses clinging,
chairs being moved,

270
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,826
like, stuff like that.

271
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,663
Or they'll hear bits
of conversation.

272
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:13,034
Residual energy is funny because
it can cause health problems.

273
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:14,035
Like?

274
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,170
Having flu symptoms
or cold symptoms.

275
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,539
Like, getting sick often.

276
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,442
I talked to a bunch of people
who spend time

277
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,810
at the Palmer House...

278
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:26,314
One time I was here,
I heard a loud explosion,

279
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,848
like a bomb went off.

280
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,951
...and all of them
had strange things happen

281
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,652
that they couldn't explain.

282
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,522
I stayed overnight,
third-floor room upstairs,

283
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:38,393
and I had a big wicker chair
move on its own.

284
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,596
As a cop, I always look for
witnesses whose stories match.

285
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,131
And just about everyone here

286
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,933
talked about seeing
shadow figures.

287
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:48,503
I can tell you about my most
emotional, scary experience.

288
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,737
One time, in the basement,

289
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,072
I was shoved by
a big black shadow figure.

290
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,008
Can you describe
what it looked like?

291
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,277
An outline, a silhouette
of a man in a suit

292
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,811
with very broad shoulders,

293
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,683
and his head went all the way up
to the top of the doorway.

294
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,551
Okay.

295
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:06,854
There's just a lot
of people.

296
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:10,424
Kind of looked like
shadow people, but they're not.

297
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,427
I don't know
what they're doing here.

298
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:13,961
I don't know why.

299
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:17,598
I would say, like, five or six.

300
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,834
It seems that they're men.

301
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:27,775
They seem confused,
and they seem a little crazy.

302
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,510
How would the living
be affected by them?

303
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:34,982
I think being exposed to them
would make a living person angry

304
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,385
and kind of nuts.

305
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Look, this is a small town,
and the Palmer House

306
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,670
is probably the most important
local landmark.

307
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:58,205
So all the historian types
know all about it.

308
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,541
But one woman
just called me back and says

309
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,878
the man who owned the property
before it became this hotel

310
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,180
has a story I'm definitely
gonna wanna know about.

311
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,286
So, Jill, thanks
for reaching out to me.

312
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,522
I appreciate that.
Who was this guy?

313
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:17,258
Yeah, that would have been
Cassius Sprigg.

314
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,660
He was one of
the early pioneers in town.

315
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,463
Okay. So what was so interesting
about this guy?

316
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,199
He was a soldier in one of
the bloodiest battles

317
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,068
between settlers
and Native Americans.

318
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,070
Okay. So now tell me about
this battle.

319
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,172
He was just, like, 15 years old
when he fought in the battle

320
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,875
that become known
as the Battle of Ridgely.

321
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,843
It's about 90 miles south
of here.

322
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:37,678
- And this kid was only 15?
- Yes, he was.

323
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,480
That was not uncommon
for that time.

324
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,949
Okay. So how does this
bloody battle end?

325
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:44,251
Well, on December 26, 1862,

326
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,388
38 Native Americans
were hung.

327
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,325
To this day, it's the largest
mass execution in history.

328
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,861
Jeez.

329
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,168
I'm seeing a woman,
and she is hanging herself.

330
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:08,009
The skeleton-face guy,
he is breaking her neck.

331
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:10,277
He's directly involved.

332
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,280
He's killing people,

333
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:16,083
actually killing them.

334
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,487
This land is very, very bad.

335
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,956
It draws the dead in.

336
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,427
The dead can't rest,
so it's like a gathering place.

337
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,796
It breeds psychopaths.

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,533
Okay.
So now the war's over.

339
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,468
When does Cassius get ahold
of my client's property?

340
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,304
He would have bought it
in 1898.

341
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,772
- Okay.
- It was a hotel

342
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,908
called the Sauk Centre House
at the time.

343
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,643
It was not
a great investment.

344
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,446
- Why?
- On June 27, 1900,

345
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,114
it burned completely
to the ground.

346
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,650
All right.
This poor guy had the property
2 years and lost everything.

347
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,853
Yes. Now, there have been
several fires

348
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,187
on that property
over the years.

349
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:54,655
You might want
to look into that.

350
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,424
That's interesting.
Okay. I will.

351
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,659
Okay. Any idea what started
this fire?

352
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,828
It started in the kitchen,
they believe.

353
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,063
- Anybody die?
- No.

354
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:03,865
There were 30 guests
in the hotel at the time.

355
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,199
There were no fatalities.

356
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,466
Okay, but it's destroyed
totally.

357
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,669
- Completely.
- What happens next?

358
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,738
He collected
the insurance money

359
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,374
and then sold it
to the family, the Palmers.

360
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,310
Who built the hotel
that's there today.
Correct.

361
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,078
Okay. So what happens to him
after he sells the property

362
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,280
to the Palmers?

363
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:21,149
Well, his fortune seemed
to change after that.

364
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,950
He went into banking.

365
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,153
By the end of his life,
he owned 12 banks.

366
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,554
Okay.
So he it turns out this fire

367
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,355
might have been
a good thing for him.

368
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,424
You can look at it that way.

369
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,695
I'm trying to figure out

370
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,565
who this skeleton-face guy was
when he was alive.

371
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:42,737
He had a lot of money,
something with a bank.

372
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,107
I'm seeing a bank had
a direct connection here.

373
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,975
Do you know when this was?

374
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:51,245
Around 1890.

375
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,247
He's protecting something.

376
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,650
I know that this is part
of his secret.

377
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:03,257
He admits to killing people
when he was alive.

378
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,660
He let that slip out.

379
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,862
He's pissed.

380
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,001
Jill said there were
other fires on the property,

381
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,703
and it turns out she's right.

382
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:18,205
I'm headed over to meet with
the city's former fire chief,

383
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:19,673
who dug through
the records for me

384
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,243
and found four major fires
on the land.

385
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:29,550
Now, John, you mentioned
on the phone

386
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,018
that there were
four major fires

387
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,419
at the property
I'm investigating.

388
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,822
Now I know one happened
in 1900.

389
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,024
I know there's three more.
Let's start with the first one.

390
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:40,027
Okay. It was back
in September of 1873.

391
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:41,295
The fire was in the barn.

392
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:43,965
They believe it had
caught on fire

393
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:47,000
from a cigar discarded
into a bale of hay.

394
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,969
All right.
Was anybody injured or killed?

395
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,905
No injured or nobody killed.

396
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:54,108
All right, John.
So what about the second fire?

397
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,478
February of 1885,
there was a large fire.

398
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,182
I'm not sure where or how
it started.

399
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:02,583
One oddity to it is that

400
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,519
the current owner of
that building at that time

401
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,388
was the Sauk Centre
Fire Chief.

402
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,723
Jeez. Okay.

403
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:11,391
So now we got three fires
on my client's property.

404
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:12,726
What about the fourth one?

405
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:17,598
July 31, 1905. It happened
at the Palmer House.

406
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,269
And as you can see, it looks
pretty much as it does today.

407
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:25,006
And it was quite big news
at the time.

408
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,741
According to this, boarders
jumped from the windows?

409
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,811
There was eight employees,
I believe, on the second floor

410
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,848
that were trapped which had
to jump out of the building,

411
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,017
onto a canopy.
- Wow.

412
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,353
Yeah, desperate times,
desperate measures.

413
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:41,622
You know, over a 30-year-period,
you got four major fires,

414
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:44,491
two really bad ones.
- Yes.

415
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,694
And I'm just shocked that
nobody got injured or killed.

416
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,328
It's amazing.

417
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,311
Getting, like, a lot of smoke.

418
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,114
Yeah, there's a lot of smoke
up here.

419
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:10,518
I'm seeing a woman,
and she can't get out.

420
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,686
I don't know what this is.

421
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,455
She is panicked.

422
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,924
She feels very dizzy,
lightheaded.

423
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,927
She can't breathe.

424
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,269
I- I don't feel good.

425
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:29,904
This is bad.

426
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,413
For more information
about the show

427
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,948
and if you need us
to investigate

428
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,883
unexplained activity
in your home...

429

and we'll help if we can.

432
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,266
So far, I've got
employees and guests

433
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,001
being tormented
by bizarre activity

434
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:05,239
on a property devastated
by four mysterious fires.

435
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,708
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

436
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,477
Searching through old records,
I find a local police officer

437
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,613
named Jason Rosenburger.

438
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:15,149
Turns out, Jason was found dead
right down the street

439
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,151
from the Palmer House.

440
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,286
So I have a local reporter

441
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,021
looking into
this cop's death for me.

442
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,490
He did some digging and said
not only did he figure out

443
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:24,792
what happened to this guy,

444
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:27,294
but he found another death
associated with the Palmer House

445
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:28,896
that may help me out.

446
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:37,171
Mark, this article I came across
where the cop wound up dead,

447
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:39,373
what were you able
to find out?

448
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,975
On April 17, 1929,

449
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:44,745
Jason Rosenburger was
a policeman,

450
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:48,849
also night patrol,
was found dead at City Hall.

451
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,251
How far is this
from the Palmer House?

452
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,352
Approximately 500 feet.

453
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:54,288
In fact, the last person
to see him alive

454
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,790
was the night clerk
at the Palmer House.

455
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,325
I know this guy got shot,

456
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,860
so do we know
where the bullet entered?

457
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,396
Next to his nose,
just right underneath the eye.

458
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,031
So I'm assuming
this is a homicide.

459
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,099
Not necessarily.

460
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,001
The coroner's jury came back

461
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,536
and said it was accidental
discharge of the firearm.

462
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,071
All right.
So if it's accidental,

463
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,240
I guess a round
from his firearm was missing,

464
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:14,708
and that's what
he shot himself with.

465
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,344
Well, that's where it gets
interesting, because the round

466
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:20,548
that they found
did not match his gun.

467
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,751
Plus, his gun was
still fully loaded.

468
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:27,021
So how the hell is this
an accidental shooting?

469
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:28,289
That, I don't know.

470
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,624
To me, it's a homicide.

471
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:31,791
I mean, it sounds almost like

472
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,161
there's something being
covered up.

473
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,831
Somebody lost their left eye.

474
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,268
It's a male.

475
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,905
This male is getting shot,
definitely a shooting.

476
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:48,141
The guy in there
got shot in the eye.

477
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:50,644
I'm not being able
to see out of it.

478
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,213
He could absolutely be
in denial.

479
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,081
So, Mark, you mentioned
on the phone

480
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,984
there was another death
that might help my case.
Yes.

481
00:23:56,986 --> 00:24:00,654
Back in 1870, there was
a freed slave named Mose

482
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,523
that lived and worked
at the property

483
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,757
you're investigating.

484
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,993
It was called the Barnum Hotel
at that time.

485
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,528
So do we know anything
about this guy Mose?

486
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,130
Well, it was known that
he was terrified of ghosts.

487
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:13,734
And also, he had experienced
some paranormal activity

488
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,269
at the Barnum Hotel.

489
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:17,004
Well, this is something
new I've never come across.

490
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:20,941
So back in 1870, somebody
was having experiences

491
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:23,177
on the property
I'm investigating now.

492
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,212
- Correct.
- How did he die?

493
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,215
A couple of local boys
wanted to pull a prank on him,

494
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,650
dress up as ghosts.

495
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:32,920
They hid in the hotel,
and everywhere he turned,

496
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,855
he'd run into a ghost,
and he got so scared

497
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:36,757
he just ran off into
the woods,

498
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,559
and he ended up spending
the night out there.

499
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,161
It was a cold and rainy night.

500
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,297
Right. So did this guy
die out in the woods?

501
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,898
No. They found him
the next morning,

502
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,968
and he was horribly sick,
brought him back to the hotel,

503
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,538
where he later died
on your client's property.

504
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:59,446
I saw several disturbing
things during my walk,

505
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,915
but two stood out.

506
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,852
First, the shadows figures
who hang out upstairs.

507
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:07,054
There was one crawling
on the ceiling.

508
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,989
There was one
crawling up the wall,

509
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:13,660
and then others that were
just really fragmented.

510
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:18,532
One looked like he was dripping,
like, chunks of tar.

511
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,268
Next, I described
the skeleton-face man

512
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,204
attacking the living.

513
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,406
There was this dead guy,

514
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:29,610
and he was pretty tall,
really thin,

515
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,046
and he was punching
a living person.

516
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,488
Amy, is this what
you saw?

517
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,324
Yes, that's what I saw.

518
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,428
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

519
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,630
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

520
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,299
and our clients
for the first time.

521
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,768
Well, Amy, I want you
to meet Kelley.

522
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,637
She owns the hotel and called us
in because activity is bad

523
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,072
and it's getting worse.

524
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,407
I got to be up front
with something.

525
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,043
No matter what you say tonight,
she ain't leaving.

526
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,247
Wyatt's been living here
for about 7 months,

527
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,482
and he's already been through
a hell of a lot,

528
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,784
and I don't think
it's going to take a lot

529
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,385
to convince him to move.

530
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,153
But they're hoping
you can figure out a way

531
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,722
to make this place safe.

532
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,524
So now that
Amy has met you guys,

533
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk for us.

534
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:44,301
I got that this was
a gathering spot
for the dead,

535
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:47,203
and it has been for
a very, very long time,

536
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,139
and because of that,

537
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,275
there is
this<i> huge</i> collection

538
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,680
of residual information.

539
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,716
I think that living would
maybe hear partying going on.

540
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,019
You'd hear, like, glasses
clinking, chairs moving,

541
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,620
people walking around.

542
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,957
If you're consistently exposed
to this kind of energy,

543
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,160
it can make somebody sick.

544
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,495
Well, it's funny.

545
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,664
You hit on some of
the experiences they're having.

546
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,165
Now, Wyatt,
you mentioned it sounded like

547
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,566
somebody dropped a...

548
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,835
30-pound weight above me,
and it's during a time

549
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,772
when I know
there's nobody in the hotel.

550
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:25,041
- Kelley, you've heard footsteps.
- That's very common.

551
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,045
I've had other guests
talk about that as well.

552
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:32,482
Now, Kelley, and you as well,
Wyatt, told me about being sick.

553
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,854
There are some days that
it's just unexplainable fatigue,

554
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,323
the headache, nausea...

555
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,658
...feeling a little off-balance
or dizzy.

556
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,861
I get the exact same
kind of feeling.

557
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,664
Sick to my stomach,
a little woozy.

558
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,533
Amy, you said you got a lot
of residual information.

559
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:55,139
Well, this building we're
sitting in was built in 1901.

560
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,641
I have a photo right around
when it was built.

561
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:01,445
There's been a hotel on this
property since at least 1867.

562
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,780
You can imagine, there's been
a lot of people over the years

563
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,482
that have come through here.

564
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,984
That totally makes sense

565
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,319
with all the residual energy
that's here.

566
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,990
Okay, so what else?

567
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,425
So I'm on the third floor.

568
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:19,963
I'm literally tasting smoke
in my mouth and coughing.

569
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,033
Then I'm feeling this woman,
but she was all alone

570
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,235
and she was freaking out,
so she was panicking, too,

571
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,236
which was making it worse

572
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,105
because she was
breathing more in.

573
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,573
There's something
you should know about, Amy,

574
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,874
about this place.

575
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,976
There were
four major fires here.

576
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,511
Holy...

577
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,480
First fire happened in 1873

578
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,449
when this hotel was known
as the Sauk Centre House.

579
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,786
Here's a photo of
the original hotel.

580
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,788
Then in February of 1885,

581
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,090
the Sauk Centre Hotel
partially burned down.

582
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,792
Records are kind of thin
on that fire,

583
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,595
so we don't know what happened,
but nobody was hurt.

584
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,197
The next fire was in 1900,

585
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,564
and this one started
in the kitchen.

586
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,001
Once again, no casualties,
but the building was destroyed.

587
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,070
After that fire,
this hotel was built.

588
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:04,074
Now, the final fire happened
in July of 1905

589
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,776
at about 2:45 a.m.,

590
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,077
and that was the scariest one.

591
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,346
They had 45 employees and guests
in the hotel at the time.

592
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,949
They were forced to evacuate,
but eight of those people

593
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,418
were trapped upstairs
on the second floor.

594
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,020
They had to jump out
of the window...

595
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:20,123
...onto the old canvas tarps
to escape.

596
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,026
I actually have an article
on that fire.

597
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,894
Now, the building
was badly damaged.

598
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,831
But amazingly enough, again,
there was no casualties.

599
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,501
- That's a lot of fires.
- I did not know that.

600
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:36,272
So I'm in the dining room,
and now I'm getting this guy.

601
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,207
And he's shot
in one of his eyes,

602
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,244
'cause I couldn't see
out of the eye.

603
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:45,582
He is a dead person,
but he's in denial.

604
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:49,920
I did come across one individual
that was shot in the eye,

605
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,988
and his name was
Jason Rosenburger.

606
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,959
Yeah, he was a Sauk Centre
policeman and a night watchman.
Wow.

607
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,929
April 17, 1929, his body
was found in the old City Hall,

608
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,463
less than 500 feet from here.

609
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,000
In fact, the Palmer House Hotel
was on Rosenburger's beat,

610
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,669
and the night that he died,

611
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,137
this was the last location
he was seen alive.

612
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,740
He had been shot in the face,
and the bullet entered

613
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,276
just underneath his eye.

614
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:15,279
Now the coroner's jury decided
it was an accidental death.

615
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,813
I don't buy it.

616
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,349
The bullet on the scene didn't
match the bullets in his gun.

617
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,819
Not only that, no round
was discharged from his firearm.

618
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm convinced it was a homicide.

619
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,689
I...Yeah.

620
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,324
- You agree?
- Absolutely.

621
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,026
Whatever happened,
happened so quick.

622
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:33,564
He had no knowledge because he's
in complete denial of his death.

623
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,699
I- I didn't know any of this,

624
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,169
and everything is
so much more real.

625
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:47,310
So another thing that I saw --
now we're going back up

626
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,778
to the third floor,

627
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,482
and I see about
four to six shadow beings,

628
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:55,785
and I knew
pretty damn quickly

629
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,122
that they were
actually dead men,

630
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,623
and the thing is,
is that these are

631
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,726
severely mentally ill people.

632
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:07,230
I think the biggest problem
with this for the living

633
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,468
is that, when you're exposed
to that kind of energy,

634
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,106
you're going to start having
behavioral changes yourself --

635
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:21,144
anger, acting kind of off
would begin to happen.

636
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,746
I've noticed that myself.

637
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,480
In yourself?
Even in myself.

638
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,318
What kind of thoughts
or emotions were you having?

639
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,587
A lot of anxiety, panicky,
a lot of nervousness

640
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,623
that came out of nowhere.

641
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,326
There's days where
all of the employees,

642
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:39,162
there can just be
very erratic,

643
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,364
unreasonable behavior,
actually.

644
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,834
- Really?
- You got a hotel here.

645
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,168
Why don't you
just sell it, right?

646
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,604
But I want you to tell Amy
how important this is.

647
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,975
I have come to take it
very personal and very seriously

648
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,577
that this is my purpose,

649
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,281
and my life is to be
the steward for it now.

650
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,649
And this is why, I told you
at the beginning,

651
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,150
she's not giving up.

652
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,686
She's not moving.

653
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,253
The crazy people
that look like shadows,

654
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,723
now would the living see that?

655
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,725
Or is that something
only you saw?

656
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:12,796
I do think that the living would
occasionally see shadow figures,

657
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,433
and I had a sketch done
of specifically what I saw.

658
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,846
Here you go, guys.

659
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,089
I gotta say that that's exactly
kind of how it feels.

660
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:42,092
It just feels like
I'm falling apart.

661
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:46,697
Just about everyone I talked
to here has seen shadow figures.

662
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:49,366
Other guests have shared
with me...
Right.

663
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,600
...lots of
different things...
Yeah.

664
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,369
...that are fairly extreme.

665
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,271
What did you consider
extreme?

666
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,939
On the ceiling, for example.

667
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,808
- Yeah.
- Up the wall.

668
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,175
That would be terrifying.

669
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,511
Yeah.
I would think so, yeah.

670
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,580
Kelley here has seen
specific shadow figures

671
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,181
down here in this basement.

672
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,316
He is so big.

673
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,686
His mass is so wide
and he's so tall.

674
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,923
- Is that what she's seeing?
- No. Mnh-mnh, no.

675
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,392
- That's somebody else.
- Ooh.

676
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,261
- That's not good news.
- Yeah.

677
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,401
So one of the dead people
that I encountered

678
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:28,338
was a dead woman
who was murdered.

679
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,408
She was murdered by the guy
that she was with,

680
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,745
and he's here,
and he's very active here,

681
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,546
but I'll get to him
in a second.

682
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:40,050
The woman is most active
in the kitchen.

683
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,419
She can get physical
with the living,

684
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,455
and I did see her pushing
a female

685
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,223
out one of the doors
out there.

686
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,858
Like, just pushing her out.

687
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,092
Now, Kelley,
you weren't pushed,

688
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,962
but you had something
thrown at you.

689
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,163
There was a mixing bowl.

690
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,367
It flew off of the shelf
it was on,

691
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,502
about 10 feet
through the air.

692
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,172
So she's throwing...

693
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,174
Now how about the guy
that killed her?

694
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:07,511
Yes. I'm gonna refer to him
as "skeleton face."

695
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,913
This is the male
who killed this female.

696
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,749
He is definitely
the biggest threat.

697
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,784
He's very, very powerful,

698
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,654
very dangerous,
and<i> very</i> secretive.

699
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:21,591
There are a few things that
I was able to get out of him.

700
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,860
He was white, lots of money.

701
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:27,564
I got that the 1890s were
very important to him,

702
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,000
absolute connection
to this location.

703
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:33,936
He made it very clear to me
that he did a lot of bad things

704
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,138
when he was alive,

705
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,408
and that included
killing several people.

706
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,144
You know, it's not a lot
to go on, but some of the stuff

707
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,411
you were talking about
reminds me

708
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,481
of one of the past owners
of this place.

709
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,148
His name was Cassius Sprigg.

710
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,451
You mentioned the 1890s
were important to him.

711
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,620
Now, he bought
this property in 1898.

712
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,956
Now, the guy you saw killed
people when he was alive.

713
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,725
Well, Cassius fought
in the Dakota-Indian Wars.

714
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,361
Now, we have no idea
how many people Cassius killed,

715
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,163
but we do know
that the war ended

716
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,431
with the execution
of 38 people,

717
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,501
and he was part of all this.

718
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,236
To this day, it's the largest
mass execution

719
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,537
in American history.

720
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,573
Now, Sprigg only owned
this hotel for a few years.

721
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,441
After he got out of
the hotel business, though,

722
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,880
he got into banking
and made a small fortune.

723
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,683
I've got a photo of him.

724
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,586
Any chances this is who you saw?

725
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,287
- Any idea?
- I don't think so

726
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,990
'cause he made it seem
like the killings

727
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:32,829
he did were not, like,
public knowledge.

728
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,164
Now you said you were concerned
about the skeleton-face guy.

729
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,266
Why is that?

730
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:40,003
This guy is capable
of mimicking voices,

731
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,571
mimicking people.

732
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,073
So like,
a friend, coworker,

733
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,507
when you think
they're saying something

734
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,143
and there's nobody there.

735
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,213
That's a common occurrence
for myself and other employees,

736
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,416
and you keep trying
to go find it, thinking,

737
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,485
"Maybe somebody came back
into the building,"

738
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,154
and then that's
eventually realized

739
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,956
that you're
in the building alone.

740
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,760
And what's probably the most
frightening for living people

741
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,897
is that he does know
how to jump people.

742
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,566
He was trying to do it to me
throughout my walk,

743
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,368
and he was
extremely aggressive

744
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,570
when I got down into
the basement.

745
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:17,374
My god.

746
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,176
These are two people that feel
like they've been jumped.

747
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,111
I don't have a lot of memory
when it happened to me,

748
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,048
I just knew it wasn't me.

749
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,515
Couldn't collect my thoughts.

750
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,519
Like, I felt like this outer
shell of me was doing something,

751
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,122
and the inside was
looking around going,

752
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:34,257
"What is going on?"

753
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,692
Something similar
happened to Wyatt.

754
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,328
I was down here in the basement
and was just, like,

755
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,864
a snap of my fingers,

756
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,533
and I felt overcome
and overwhelmed.

757
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,871
He will do anything he can
to instill fear

758
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,872
and get the living
out of here,

759
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,076
and that can become
physical or be physical --

760
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,012
slapping, pushing, punching.

761
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,048
I saw him punching a male
in the back,

762
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,284
and I did have a sketch done.

763
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:04,688
This should be interesting.

764
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,366
Ooh.

765
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,909
That's some picture, ain't it?

766
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,712
I don't know even know
what to say to that.

767
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,181
My god.

768
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,718
What's this speck behind it?
What's this going on?

769
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,919
This is a friend of his,

770
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,788
and they're killing
this guy here.

771
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,557
He didn't want me
to see that.

772
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,995
He's gotta go.

773
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,331
What the hell does this guy
want from these guys?

774
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,433
Basically, he wants
to kill living people.

775
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,999
Kelley, you made it
very clear

776
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,935
that leaving here
is not an option for you.

777
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,670
But after what
we've heard tonight,

778
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:14,073
it's crystal clear that
it's not safe here for you,

779
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:15,909
your employees or the guests.

780
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:18,811
Now we're going to find out if
there's any way to change that.

781
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,880
For that answer, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

782
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:27,721
I have something to say
really quickly.

783
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,456
A few days after my walk,

784
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,892
I see that you're doing
an event here --

785
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,228
a ghost tour.
- Yeah.

786
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,933
How long have you been
doing that?

787
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,469
Probably for about
4 or 5 years now.

788
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:45,604
You've noticed an increase
in activity?

789
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:49,742
I would say that's fair.

790
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,678
When you're stirring up
this kind of activity,

791
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,081
...gonna go wrong.

792
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,215
I gotta ask you.

793
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:57,851
When we talked,
you never really mentioned

794
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,919
about this whole
ghost-hunting thing.

795
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:04,623
I never thought of that as
being a contributing factor.

796
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:08,661
A big reason of why
I do what I do is the dead.

797
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:13,666
These were people,
and they still are people.

798
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:18,605
It's easy, I think,
for the living, um,

799
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:24,411
to have a disassociation
with that concept.

800
00:39:24,413 --> 00:39:28,081
My question is,
what do you want to do?

801
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,818
And do you want
the dead here or not?

802
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:41,360
If they need moving on,
I'm in complete support of that.

803
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,897
All right. So how do they
get rid of 'em?

804
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,499
You do have to find
a male medium

805
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:50,970
who is also
a chaos magician.

806
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:55,575
He is going to basically
collect

807
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:58,178
the dead skeleton guy

808
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,248
and remove him
from the location altogether.

809
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,518
The other thing that does
is that it literally

810
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,489
will clear the basement
of not only him but also

811
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:15,061
all the residual information
and energy down here.

812
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:21,467
So, like, this basement?
Nothing. Nothing going on.

813
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,937
So she won't see the shadows
down here, won't get jumped.

814
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:26,406
Yeah, that's right.

815
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:30,076
On another day, the same medium
could come back and remove

816
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:34,413
all of the shadow people
and the pissy lady.

817
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:39,418
Unfortunately, the cop, nothing,
at this point, can be done.

818
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,355
Now, if you want to keep
doing ghost tours,

819
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,824
you can keep the residual,

820
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:47,894
and there is
a<i> plethora</i> of it.

821
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:49,695
So, Kelley,
when we first talked,

822
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,631
you were just about ready
to break down.

823
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:56,536
Now it looks like you get to
not only keep your place

824
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,805
but find out a way
to make it safe

825
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,308
and still have it
as an attraction for people

826
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,178
that are into the ghost hunting.

827
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,780
That would absolutely
be ideal.

828
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:11,050
Now the ultimate question --
Are you gonna do what she says?

829
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,519
Yes, I absolutely will.

830
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,453
So, Wyatt, what about you?

831
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:15,922
Would you be willing
to help out?

832
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:18,457
Yeah, I'm here for her.

833
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:25,764
I am so immensely pleased
and relieved and grateful.

834
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:29,669
I feel very optimistic
about everything.

835
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,270
It won't be easy

836
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:33,206
removing the dangerous dead
inside this hotel.

837
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:36,075
But if Kelley contacts
the medium, who is also

838
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,477
a chaos magician,
to banish the dead,

839
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,879
her guests and employees
will be safe,

840
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:43,883
and she can keep running
the hotel she loves so much.
