1
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:13,045
I'm getting violence.

2
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,182
It could harm the living,
physically.

3
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,284
I feel like this house
killed my husband.

4
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,486
This female feels suicidal.

5
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,556
He was the love
of my life.

6
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:24,991
I blame myself
for him.

7
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,861
I could feel
a rope around my neck.

8
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,764
It felt like something
went through me.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,233
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

10
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,636
"This can't be happening.
No way."

11
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,239
This is not
a good situation.

12
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,408
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,709
There's death here.

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,511
Don't want to
go down there.

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,013
I see dead people.

16
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,081
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,684
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,320
She's definitely
a serial killer.

19
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,022
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,558
She's going
to torture them.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,028
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,130
They were all murdered.

23
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,831
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,266
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,168
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,837
So, is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

27
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,741
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,376
There's no question
in my mind

29
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,378
that he was talking
about Satan.

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,380
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,915
Who do you think
possessed you?

32
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,750
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,752
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,120
...until the very end...

35
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,722
Well, you're not gonna
want to see this.

36
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,091
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,526
Hell no!

38
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,027
...or time to get out.

39
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,196
Everyone is in jeopardy.

40
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,213
I'm back in Waxahachie, Texas.

41
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,849
It's a small town about
a half-hour south of Dallas.

42
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,651
I got a call
from a woman named Kim.

43
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:01,120
She sounds real broken up,

44
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,723
says whatever's in the house
killed her husband.

45
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,491
Now, her daughter is about
to move back in,

46
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,027
and she's terrified
it's gonna go after her, too.

47
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,397
She's desperate for
help and says we are
her very last hope.

48
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,701
Before Amy arrives,

49
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:19,405
I clear the area
of any leading information.

50
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,308
This home is filled
with family photographs,

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,610
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,448
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,193
Boy.

54
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,362
Somebody doesn't
want me over there.

55
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,930
Literally, I'm feeling like

56
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,801
I'm having to push
through energy to get there.

57
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm feeling like
I'm being pushed away.

58
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,342
This is not a good situation.

59
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,412
I'm getting violence, violence.

60
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,419
Well, Kim,
I got to tell you,

61
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,587
this is an absolutely
beautiful home.

62
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,322
It sounds like
you're going through
a tough time here.

63
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,058
Why were you so desperate
for us to come?

64
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,559
As crazy as it sounds,

65
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,594
I feel like this house
killed my husband.

66
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,798
What did he pass from?

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,533
He died of
a malignant brain tumor

68
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,368
that was inoperable.

69
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,270
He eventually
became bedridden,

70
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,905
and he passed away
in the house.

71
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,206
And how old was he
when he passed?

72
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,808
45 years old.

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,610
Why do you think the
house had anything to
do with his tumor?

74
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,279
He was
a perfectly healthy man,

75
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,447
strong as an ox.

76
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,049
And then you just...

77
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,484
you die.

78
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,519
It's not fair.

79
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,654
No, it's not.

80
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,956
This is a picture
of my husband, Angel.

81
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,928
Had he been
diagnosed already?

82
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,731
No, that was within the year
before he was diagnosed.

83
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,299
Okay.

84
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:55,835
When did you guys
start having experiences?

85
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:59,238
From the very first moment
we stepped foot in the house.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,540
While your husband
was alive, did you
guys do anything

87
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,844
to try to figure out
what was going on here?

88
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,246
We actually had a team come
and do a blessing.

89
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,914
When you say "a team,"
what do you mean?

90
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,683
Like a paranormal...
A paranormal team.

91
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,551
Okay,
so how did that go?

92
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,487
The atmosphere
felt lighter,

93
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,988
but it didn't last long.

94
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,090
Now, Kim, do you know
any history about the house?

95
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,493
I know that it was built
in 1915,

96
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,495
and that one of
the original owners,

97
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,063
T.W. Burleson...
Okay.

98
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,466
...was actually struck
by an automobile
across the street,

99
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,368
and he was killed.

100
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,371
Why did you want
this house so bad?

101
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,707
I saw the house
and fell in love with it.

102
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,709
Angel said that my dream
would be his

103
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,344
and he would learn
to love it.

104
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,280
But it wasn't something
that he was crazy about.

105
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,982
And he says,
"If it's your dream,

106
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:45,151
it will become mine."

107
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:48,587
I feel like I'm responsible
for his death

108
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,689
because if I hadn't
have been insistent

109
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,424
about moving
into this house,

110
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,894
maybe he would
still be alive.

111
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,729
He was the love
of my life.

112
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,798
I don't want you
to feel guilty.

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,199
Here, hang on.

114
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,300
Take this.

115
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,572
I do.

116
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,645
If it was just his time,
because things happen,

117
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,513
I can totally accept that.

118
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,216
But if there was something
attached to him,

119
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,818
in this house...
Yeah.

120
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,419
...that hurt him...

121
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,723
...I can't help
but blame myself.

122
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,692
And now you have your daughter
moving back in, right?

123
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,829
I can't risk
her coming back home

124
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,197
and something
happening to her.

125
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,099
I'd never forgive myself,
because I don't --

126
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,568
I blame myself for him.

127
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,304
I can't have anything
happen to my daughter.

128
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,672
Okay.

129
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,074
I need whatever it is,
if there's something here,

130
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,610
to be gone.

131
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:53,986
I think a living woman here
is suffering from depression.

132
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:57,156
I got a great loss.

133
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,692
Something happened
to somebody that they know,

134
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,962
and now this female
feels suicidal.

135
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,336
Somebody died in this area.

136
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,204
I'm not exactly sure where.

137
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,073
I'm hearing,
"Man, this is wrong.

138
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,008
This is so wrong.
No way, no way.

139
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,544
This is wrong."

140
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,781
Like, this can't be
happening, no way.

141
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,889
You spend a lot of time
up here?

142
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,424
Yes.
It was Angel's room.

143
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,526
Occasionally,
I come up here
to remember him

144
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,794
and feel close to him.

145
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,730
In fact,
those are his ashes.

146
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,531
- Right there?
- Yes.

147
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,166
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

148
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,935
We've heard
disembodied voices.

149
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:43,903
Okay, what kind?

150
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,204
The sound
of a little girl,

151
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,772
and we've heard
a woman screaming.

152
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,874
Now, the scream --
what did it sound like?

153
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,310
It sounded like
a woman was being hurt.

154
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,779
We even called the police
and had them come out.

155
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,314
They showed up,
searched the grounds,

156
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:58,284
and found no evidence
of a woman.

157
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,385
Anything else?

158
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:02,187
Yes, I've been pushed
down the stairs.

159
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,023
Okay,
tell me what happened.

160
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,891
I was actually walking
down the stairs

161
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,994
and felt two hands
on my back and shoved me,

162
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,863
and I went tumbling down
to the end.

163
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,131
How bad
did you get hurt?

164
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,299
I was bruised
and battered,

165
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,967
but not seriously hurt.

166
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,836
I mean, you're very lucky.
You could've broke your neck.

167
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,242
I saw a crazy old man,

168
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:26,211
like late 60s, early 70s.

169
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,513
He acts like an animal

170
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,014
with him crawling
on the ceiling,

171
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,016
crawling on the walls.

172
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,519
Well, he jumped down,
and he was, like, kind of like

173
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,587
doing an all-fours
kind of thing.

174
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,223
And he then went back up
on the ceiling,

175
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,026
and then he was
grabbing my hair.

176
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,562
So, I felt like that's something

177
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,898
the living here
might experience,

178
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,335
is having their hair
pulled or tugged.

179
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,475
I'm hearing children up here.

180
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,946
Little, little kids.

181
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,716
Somebody's screaming.

182
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,418
Piercing scream, female.

183
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,428
Okay, is this where
Angel passed?

184
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,863
Yes.

185
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,331
Do you
still sleep here?

186
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,466
Yes.

187
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:22,401
What about experiences
that you've had?

188
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:25,104
Several times,
I've actually seen
a shadow figure.

189
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,305
Describe it for me.

190
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,341
It's a tall, slim
shadow figure.

191
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,443
So, how are you so sure
it's not an actual person?

192
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,846
Because when it's a person,
there are distinct features,

193
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,848
and this was just
total blackness.

194
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,717
Anything else?

195
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,053
I was actually scratched
on my hand.

196
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,355
We were actually
having a discussion,

197
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,025
and I looked down,
and there were three
scratches on my hand.

198
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,360
And it actually felt
like my hand was on fire.

199
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,928
Okay, now,
what about Angel?

200
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,330
Did he have experiences
in here?

201
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:52,898
Yes, oftentimes
he would wake up

202
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,767
with bruises
and bite marks.

203
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,136
Here's a photo.

204
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,604
Geez.

205
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,106
Now, could this bruising
have come from the
medication he was on?

206
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,843
No, because that happened
well before he was diagnosed.

207
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,645
All right, did anything else
happen with Angel?

208
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:10,149
Yes, one night I awakened
to him standing over me,

209
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,918
and he looked or appeared
as if he was possessed.

210
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,553
Okay, so what
makes you say that?

211
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,821
It wasn't my husband.

212
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,856
One of the things
I called him was<i> "Papi"...</i>

213
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,024
Okay.
...and he loved that.

214
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,627
This person looked at me
and said, essentially,

215
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,195
"If you call me
<i> 'Papi'</i> one more time,

216
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,963
I'll smack
the hell out of you."

217
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,533
The next morning,
he remembered
absolutely nothing.

218
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:29,368
Yeah, but was he drinking
that night?

219
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,402
No.

220
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,104
Did he take any drugs
or anything?

221
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,372
No.

222
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,973
Do you think
he's here?

223
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,175
I do.

224
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,409
You do.

225
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,548
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,284
I'm sorry.
I know. I know.

227
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,055
This room has issues.

228
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,124
There are a lot of dead
in here,

229
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,393
and they're walking
through that mirror.

230
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,995
I think some go in the mirror,
and I think some go out.

231
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,599
So would the living
in this room

232
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,235
be in any kind of danger
from all this traffic?

233
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,371
Yes. This place
is extremely active.

234
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:13,312
I feel really bad.

235
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,167
You haven't lived here
in a while,

236
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,302
but when you were here,
did you have experiences?

237
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,237
Yes, I did.

238
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,838
Okay, let's talk
about them.

239
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,374
One night,
while I was in bed,

240
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,344
I felt something bad.

241
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,612
In what way?

242
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,981
Whatever it was,
it wasn't friendly,

243
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,251
and I felt that
it wanted to hurt me.

244
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,252
It was terrifying.

245
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,753
You sure you weren't
dreaming this?

246
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,888
Yes.

247
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,190
It was one of
the worst experiences

248
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,725
I've ever had
in this house.

249
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,494
So, you said it was
<i> one</i> of the worst experiences.

250
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,029
What was the worst?

251
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,265
I was standing
in front of the toilet,

252
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,668
and something pushed me
over the counter.

253
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,370
When you got pushed,
did it feel like

254
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,338
a human being
was pushing you?

255
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,176
No, it felt like
something went through me.

256
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,443
Did you get hurt
at all?

257
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,712
No, I managed
to catch myself.

258
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,014
You're lucky because

259
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,882
that could have been
really serious.

260
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,921
<i> Something</i> happened here, man.

261
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,225
I'm seeing a male
with a shotgun on his hip.

262
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,495
He's kind of dressed
like a farmer.

263
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,032
He's in here with this thing.

264
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,701
It's a black mass.

265
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,537
This black mass and this farmer
have the capability

266
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,473
of interacting
with its surroundings.

267
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,878
That could mean that it could
harm the living, physically.

268
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,649
Do you know
what they want?

269
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,722
I'm hearing the farmer say,
"I want my house back."

270
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,865
So, Vernon, I understand
you're Kim's brother?

271
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, sir.

272
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,468
What's it like
when you come here?

273
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,705
I'm scared. I won't even go
to the restroom by myself.

274
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,207
Me and my wife
go together.

275
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,577
So, I'm assuming
you've had experiences, then?

276
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,779
Yeah, with the swing
on the front porch.

277
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,382
I come outside,
it was just swinging.

278
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,184
The trees won't
be swaying or nothing.

279
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,720
It be swinging like
somebody's sitting in it.

280
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:40,157
And you didn't see no
kids going by, maybe
jerking around with it?
None of that.

281
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,659
Okay, anything else?

282
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,396
Yeah, I saw a man,
a dog, and a tree

283
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,597
just disappear.

284
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,469
Okay,
that's a new one on me.

285
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,536
Tell me what happened.

286
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,772
About 2:00
in the morning,

287
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,474
and I looked
out the window,

288
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,875
and I saw it.

289
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,579
I looked again,
and it was gone,
just like that.

290
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,815
That's pretty interesting stuff
you've experienced here.
Yeah.

291
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,183
So, are you worried
about your sister

292
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,752
being in this house
all alone?

293
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,387
I mean, this house is huge.

294
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,421
Yes, sir.

295
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,856
Would you stay
in this house alone,

296
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,658
or you and your wife together
stay here alone?

297
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,260
I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

298
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,628
Okay.

299
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,497
For real, I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

300
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,271
There's<i> a lot</i>
of residual energy here.

301
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,675
It's kind of overwhelming.

302
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,214
How would the living
be affected by all this?

303
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,684
I think that they would
see things on occasion.

304
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,453
I think they would hear
<i> a lot</i> of things.

305
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,390
It's making me sick.

306
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,865
Okay, so, Tony, Sarah,
I understand that you guys

307
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,233
are part of
the paranormal team

308
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,802
that came in
to investigate the house.

309
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,836
Kim called you guys,
right?

310
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,671
- We are.
- That's right.

311
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,774
All right, so, Tony,
you used this equipment
on your investigation?
Yes.

312
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,943
Okay, now tell me
about what you got in there.

313
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,479
This right here
would be a digital recorder,

314
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,214
which would record EVPs,

315
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,583
or, you know,
electronic voice phenomena.

316
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,851
Okay.

317
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,486
This would be
a Mel Meter,

318
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,556
and this right here
actually detects
ambient temperature,

319
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,192
as well as
electromagnetic fields.

320
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,496
A ghost box
is a tool used.

321
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,766
It gives spirits
a way to communicate --

322
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,301
a white noise,
if you will.

323
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,769
After your investigation,

324
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,437
in your
professional opinion,

325
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,072
what did you find
that was here?

326
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,174
You felt like something
was watching you all the time,

327
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,110
like the air
might bite you.

328
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,711
Kim believes that
whatever's in this house

329
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,247
is what made Angel sick
and eventually pass away.

330
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,548
Do you agree with that?

331
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,317
- I do.
- Yes.

332
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,253
We're pretty certain that
that's what happened to Angel.

333
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,196
At some point, spiritualism
was practiced here.

334
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,268
Like 1901 to 1920s?

335
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,407
Possibly, these people
did something bad,

336
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,008
accidentally,
you know?

337
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:17,782
I'm seeing paranormal
investigators doing EVPs, maybe?

338
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,451
And he's taking pictures
and video.

339
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,187
The female is saying,
"Don't go into the darkness."

340
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,161
I'm seeing
a paranormal investigator here,

341
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,562
and then, downstairs,

342
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,866
seeing these spiritualists
practiced here.

343
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,735
To me, that's scary

344
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,471
because you don't know
what they're doing,

345
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,640
so they could be
agitating dead people.

346
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,241
And if you agitate them,

347
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,877
they could be hurting
living people.

348
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,026
Kim said a previous
homeowner died

349
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,161
after getting hit by a car
in front of the house,

350
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,164
so I called my old friend,
historian Sylvia Smith,

351
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,300
and she says it's true.

352
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,635
But she says this guy
also led a colorful life

353
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,437
I'm definitely going
to want to know about.

354
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,046
Well, Sylvia,
it's good to see you again.

355
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,981
Before we get to the accident,
you said on the phone

356
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,649
that this guy had
an interesting life.

357
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,084
What can you
tell me about him?

358
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,420
The gentleman
you're speaking of
is T.W. Burleson.

359
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,857
He was a farmer,
and he came here in 1902

360
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,426
and bought this property
that you're investigating.

361
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,861
Was he married
at this point?

362
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,928
Yes, he was.

363
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,498
He was married to a lady
named May Ward.

364
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,468
Soon after they came,
he turned his property
into a honey business.

365
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,636
Okay.

366
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,272
And I have this photo here
of the backyard

367
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,474
just filled
with bee hives.

368
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,477
So, now, did they
live on the property
with the bees?

369
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,614
I'm not sure where
they lived up until 1915,

370
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,316
when they built the house
that's on the property today.

371
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,618
So, business
had to be good

372
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,086
because that house
is big.

373
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,722
They did very well
until 1925,

374
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,359
when the factory
that was on the
property burned.

375
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,060
Okay, so how much damage
we talking about?

376
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,130
Well, they had
$30,000 worth of damage.

377
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,832
And, in today's market,

378
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,067
it would probably be
$400,000.

379
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,637
They shut down for
like three months
while they rebuilt.

380
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,804
Okay.

381
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,977
I'm seeing the farmer guy again,
and I think he owned this land.

382
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,316
But I hear a,
"Don't go in the barn,"

383
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,451
and I'm getting a fire.

384
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,756
I feel like
there's a couple of structures

385
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,692
that aren't here anymore
that belonged to him,

386
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,827
and he's, like,
just pacing over here.

387
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,531
I'm getting panicked and,
like, completely freaked out.

388
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,735
He's in a rage.

389
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,806
Somebody pissed him off...
bad.

390
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,374
Do you have
any idea why?

391
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,377
Bad dealings, business,

392
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,514
money lost.

393
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,583
He's got nothing else to lose.

394
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,021
Okay, so let's
get to the accident.

395
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,489
I know Burleson
was hit by a car

396
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,958
in front of
my client's property.

397
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,827
Yes, the accident
was in 1944,

398
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,195
and he was
severely injured.

399
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,165
In fact, he remained
in the hospital for two weeks

400
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,666
before he passed away.

401
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,101
He had a fractured skull,

402
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,303
and he died
from swelling of the brain.

403
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,638
Here's
his death certificate,

404
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,240
right here,
that states that.

405
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,743
He was only 67 years old
when he passed away.

406
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,545
So he was
a young man still.

407
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,746
Well, I know
what you meant now

408
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,514
when you said that
he had an interesting life.

409
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,618
I mean, he started out with
nothing, worked his way...

410
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,553
All the way to the top,
you might say.

411
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,155
Right, and then
he tragically gets
hit by a car...

412
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,590
That's true.
...and dies.

413
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,062
I think something bad happened
to this farmer guy.

414
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,264
I hear 1940s,

415
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,400
and I feel my neck break.

416
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,803
He's trying to make me sick.

417
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,007
Because his energy is so bad,

418
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,409
I don't think
the living would enjoy

419
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,112
a large portion,
even, of the land.

420
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,081
Their heart
would start hurting.

421
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,252
They would feel
extremely nauseous, shaky,

422
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,888
nervous, scared.

423
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,057
I just, like,
totally want to cry here.

424
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,496
So far, I've got
a grieving widow

425
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,264
who believes her house
killed her husband

426
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,333
on a property
where a previous owner died

427
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,502
in a tragic car accident.

428
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,004
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

429
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,172
Searching through old records,

430
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,541
I come across a teenager
named Kenneth Doty

431
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,576
who worked
in the bee factory.

432
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,479
Turns out he hung himself
in 1968,

433
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,081
right on Kim's property.

434
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,886
So I called a bunch
of Kimberly's neighbors.

435
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,789
Most of them didn't know
anything about the hanging.

436
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,123
But then I found one old guy,

437
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,693
and it turns out he worked
side by side with Kenny.

438
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,062
Not only that,
he remembers the day he died.

439
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,772
Now, I understand
this kid Doty

440
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,474
actually worked
on the property.

441
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,575
Is that correct?
Yes.

442
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,843
Did you get
to know him at all?

443
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,745
Yeah, just through
working with him.

444
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:15,679
What was he like?

445
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,680
Well,
he was a good kid.

446
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,848
You know,
he was a hard worker.

447
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,417
He played football,
number 63.

448
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,854
He didn't talk
a whole lot.

449
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,456
You asked him
to do something, he did it,

450
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,890
and he did a good job.

451
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,392
And he was
how old at the time?

452
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,927
I think 18.

453
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,730
Now, Sonny, I know
this happened on
October 19th in 1968.

454
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,997
What happened that day?

455
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,133
I guess he just
got depressed

456
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,201
and hung himself.

457
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,335
Now, where
did he do that?

458
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,738
Right here.

459
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,372
He took
a piece of strapping,

460
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,407
similar to this stuff.

461
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,709
Let me see that.
Okay.

462
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,611
So it looks like,
almost like a rope.

463
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,913
He ties it
on the ladder,

464
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,782
climbs up the ladder,

465
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,484
puts it
around his neck,

466
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,219
and jumps
over that rafter.

467
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,156
And he was hanging
about where I'm standing.

468
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,624
Now, who found him?

469
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,592
My wife.

470
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,727
- Your wife did?
- Yes.

471
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,130
I come in
later that evening

472
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,132
and find out about it.

473
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,233
There wasn't anything left

474
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,869
but that piece of rope
tied to the ladder.

475
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,270
So, now,
were they pretty sure

476
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,239
it was officially
a suicide?

477
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,074
That's what his
death certificate says...

478
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,609
Let me see.

479
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,146
...and I don't have
any reason to believe it
would be anything else.

480
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,914
Any indication why the hell
he might have did this?

481
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,049
He had broken up
with his girlfriend,

482
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,651
and he was depressed.

483
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,253
18 years old, he
had his whole life
in front of him,

484
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,588
and, you know, he threw it
all away for a girl.

485
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,090
Yeah.

486
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,896
I just got a young male,

487
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,431
not that long ago --
'40s, '50s --

488
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,668
I would say between
the age of 15 and 20.

489
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,304
I was in his body,

490
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,673
and I could feel
a rope around my neck.

491
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,311
Somebody had the other side
of the rope,

492
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,047
so it's looped over something,

493
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,650
and they're tugging
on that rope,

494
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,419
so I kept going up and down
by my neck.

495
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,724
I don't know specifically
how many people there were,

496
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,359
but I heard them laughing,

497
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,130
so I know a man
was doing the tugging on me.

498
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,065
Eventually,
it did break the neck.

499
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,801
He's reliving,
over and over again,

500
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,303
what happened to him.

501
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,405
It's really bad!

502
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:48,608
Another thing got my attention
in research --

503
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,010
during the Civil War,
there was a deadly explosion

504
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:53,112
at a gunpowder mill
right near Kim's house.

505
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:56,315
I'm heading over
to meet a local professor

506
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:59,552
who says it was a massive blast
that rocked the entire area.

507
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,293
Robin, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

508
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,361
Thank you.

509
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:09,929
Okay, this explosion
that happened,

510
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,998
before we even get to that,
I'm curious --

511
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,700
what was Waxahachie like
during the Civil War?

512
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:18,438
Waxahachie and pretty
much all of the small
towns in Texas --

513
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,872
there were
a number of people

514
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,674
who were opposed
to secession

515
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,343
and a number of people who
wanted secession to happen,

516
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:26,145
and Waxahachie
was the same way.

517
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:28,014
So there was
a lot of tension.

518
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,315
This was a period of time

519
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,484
that was called
the "Texas Troubles."

520
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:33,553
Okay, so what happened
with the explosion?

521
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:36,389
On April 29th, 1863,

522
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:39,826
a gunpowder mill exploded
less than a mile away

523
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,894
from the property
you're investigating.

524
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:43,329
It's less than a mile
from my client's property.

525
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,065
I got to assume they must
have heard it and felt it.

526
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,066
Most definitely.

527
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,101
I would describe it
as "seismic,"

528
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:52,271
meaning that it probably
shook the walls and so forth.

529
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:55,208
Now, how much gunpowder
do we think exploded?

530
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,878
There was about 800 pounds
that exploded.

531
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,447
Wow. Okay,
so what about casualties?

532
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,917
There were two
men who perished
in the explosion.

533
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,452
Okay, so now
we have two dead?

534
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:07,887
Yes.

535
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,122
So, was there an
investigation or
any arrests done?

536
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,958
There were no arrests
then, no.

537
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,327
Okay. All right, so
what's the theories
on what happened?

538
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,828
Well, there were
a number of people

539
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,163
that thought
it was sabotage.

540
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,166
David Natz, who survived
the explosion,

541
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,536
he mentioned that
there was a possible
Northern sympathizer

542
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:26,472
or a stranger that
was lurking around the mill

543
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:28,074
before the explosion.

544
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,442
But they never
found this guy?

545
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,477
No. No, they never
found this guy.

546
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,945
He magically disappeared.

547
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,747
So, Robin, what do
you think happened?

548
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:37,483
David Natz,
he was in charge of the mill

549
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,018
at the explosion,
at the time,

550
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,753
and he was just
a 20-year-old kid --

551
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,189
inexperienced
and kind of green.

552
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,191
It was most likely
an accident,

553
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,826
is what I believe.
Right.

554
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,461
Well,
it's a tragic story,

555
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:51,664
but pretty lucky that
only two people died
in this explosion.

556
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,065
I agree.

557
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,974
I'm getting
a sharp pain here.

558
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,242
This is a male.

559
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:07,046
I'm hearing military.

560
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,882
He's white, crew cut.

561
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,784
I think he's in his 20s.

562
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,889
I'm seeing people drinking,
having a good time,

563
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,325
and then I see
the room turns like

564
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:22,461
this weird,
pinkish-orange color,

565
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:26,966
and I hear people
yelling and screaming.

566
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:32,672
There's maybe, in this room,
four or five people,

567
00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:35,775
and literally
everything goes dark,

568
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:38,844
and all you see
is this weird color.

569
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,379
I heard the word "fire."

570
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,514
Any idea
when this was?

571
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:42,582
It's old.

572
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,117
They're showing me
bodies laid out.

573
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,189
I'm hearing someone say,
"It came to a bad end."

574
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:04,670
During my walk,
I saw several disturbing things,

575
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,307
but the angry farmer
concerned me the most.

576
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,178
I'd probably put him
in his late 60s.

577
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,548
He was wearing a hat,

578
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,418
and he had massive,
like, dark circles

579
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,221
and<i> deep</i> sun lines.

580
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,330
Amy,
is this who you saw?

581
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,567
Yes,
that's who I saw.

582
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:57,056
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

583
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:59,158
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

584
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,460
and our client
for the first time.

585
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:03,229
Now, Amy, when I sat down
the other day

586
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:04,630
to talk with Kim,

587
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,165
her story
was so heartbreaking

588
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,968
I had a tough time
keeping it together.

589
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,203
For now, I'm gonna hold off
on telling you too much,

590
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:12,672
but she lives here alone,

591
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,440
and the main reason
she called us in

592
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,242
is because of her daughter,
Gabrielle.

593
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,845
She's supposed to
move back in,

594
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,814
and Kim doesn't think
it's safe.

595
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,918
So now that I told Amy
a little bit about you, Kim,

596
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk.

597
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,725
When I first
got to your house,

598
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:36,529
I ran into a dead male
between 15 and 20 years old.

599
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,330
I got that he is
a conscious entity,

600
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:40,633
but, unfortunately,
he's stuck

601
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,568
in the loop
of his death.

602
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,903
I was in his body,

603
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,905
so I'm not sure
what he looked like,

604
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:48,741
but I could feel that there
was a rope around my neck.

605
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:51,043
Rope, I know,
was looped over something.

606
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,011
He was hanged.

607
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,245
I believe
it was a murder,

608
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,980
and I believe
it was fairly recent --

609
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,717
as far as
the '40s or the '50s.

610
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,585
That's pretty amazing.

611
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:01,053
Well, back in the day,
the property used to be

612
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,055
a family-run
honey factory.

613
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:04,323
It's a family-run business,

614
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,759
but they hired a few
local teenagers to help out.

615
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,527
Now, one of these kids
was an 18-year-old

616
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,229
named Kenny Doty.

617
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,964
He was a quiet,
hardworking kid

618
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:13,833
who mostly
kept to himself,

619
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:17,503
but, on October 19th, 1968,
they found his dead body

620
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:19,305
hanging from a rafter
in the shed.

621
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:20,706
What?

622
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,974
Now, I talked to
this nice older guy

623
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,809
who ran
the family business.

624
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,377
He told me
he got to know Kenny.

625
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,848
Apparently, he was really upset
about a breakup with a girl.

626
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,216
Now, I got his
death certificate here.

627
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:32,852
Now, the cops ruled it
a suicide.

628
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,856
I got a photo. You didn't see
the kid, though, right?

629
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:38,190
No, I was in his body.

630
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Okay,
this is the kid here.

631
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,265
My daughter has
seen a teenage boy
on the property

632
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,700
with dark hair.

633
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,769
Is it possible
she's seen this kid
on the property?

634
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,637
Yeah,
it's a<i> huge</i> possibility.

635
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,007
What else?

636
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,942
When I was upstairs,

637
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,679
in the bedroom
to the far right...

638
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:02,248
That sounds like
Gabrielle's room.

639
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,716
Yes.

640
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:07,653
...now, I encountered
two entities up there
that did concern me.

641
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:11,190
One was in the form
of a black mass.

642
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,728
Black mass could be
physically violent.

643
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,129
Anybody who would stay
in that room

644
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:21,333
would potentially have
negative experiences.

645
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,837
This is interesting
'cause when I spoke
to Gabrielle,

646
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,072
she told me
that she was lying in bed

647
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:28,908
and she felt
that something really bad

648
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,609
was lying
right next to her.

649
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:31,944
She thought
if she turned around,

650
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:33,345
she was gonna
get attacked.

651
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,747
The second experience
happened

652
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:37,116
in the bathroom upstairs
next to her room.

653
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,919
She told me she was pushed,
and she was pushed hard.

654
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,589
Did you know about that?
She didn't tell you?

655
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:44,423
No.

656
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:47,159
Here.

657
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,494
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I thought you knew.

658
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,565
No, I didn't know that
she was being attacked.

659
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,933
And I certainly didn't know

660
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:56,368
about the thing
hovering over her.

661
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,536
Well, that's why
we're here --

662
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:00,239
to find out what the hell
is going on, right?

663
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:03,275
Now, you also got attacked
outside Gabrielle's bedroom.

664
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:04,810
Tell Amy what happened.

665
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:08,547
I was actually walking
down the stairs,

666
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,618
and I actually felt the presence
of something on my back,

667
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,388
and I actually felt two hands
just shove me.

668
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,257
And I went tumbling
down the stairs.

669
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,825
Wow!

670
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:22,161
Now, you said there was
another entity you saw.

671
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:25,998
Yes, and the second entity
is a dead male.

672
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,867
I got that
he was a farmer.

673
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,802
He is probably in his 60s,

674
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:33,539
and, on his hip,
he has a double-barrel shotgun.

675
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,809
Outside, he was going off
about a fire.

676
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:41,046
He was angry, stomping around
all over back there.

677
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,249
I felt that this dude
lost his money.

678
00:30:43,251 --> 00:30:46,518
He was saying, "I don't have
anything else left to lose."

679
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,821
And I heard something
about 1940s,

680
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:51,023
and I got that he was
connected to the property,

681
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:52,825
that he may have owned it.

682
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:54,627
I said,
"Well, what do you want?"

683
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:57,162
And he goes,
"I just want my house back."

684
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:58,397
I'm pissed.

685
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,432
He wants his home back?

686
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,601
He can't have it.

687
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:04,803
This reminds me
of one of the previous owners

688
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,839
that I came across
in my research.

689
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,174
Now, his name
was T.W. Burleson,

690
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:13,312
and he built your house,
this house, in 1915.

691
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:14,914
Now, he ran
that honey business

692
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,415
that I was talking
about earlier.
Right.

693
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,150
This is pretty interesting.

694
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:21,887
Here's a picture of all
these damn bee hives
he had in the backyard.

695
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:23,756
You said something
about fire.

696
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,891
Well, in 1925,
there was a major fire,

697
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,193
and it burned
the factory down.

698
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:30,663
Now, you said something
about the 1940s.

699
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:33,832
In 1944,
T.W. was crossing the street

700
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:37,036
right in front of the house
when he was hit by a car.

701
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:38,437
They rushed him
to the hospital.

702
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,240
Two weeks later,
he dies from a brain swelling.

703
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,208
You said this guy
was in his 60s.

704
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,911
Burleson was 67
at the time of his death.

705
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,980
Now, I managed to track
down a photo of him,

706
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:52,451
but this was probably closer to
when, I think, he passed away.

707
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,386
Is it possible
this is who you saw?

708
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:58,791
I mean, I had a sketch
done of him.

709
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You kidding?

710
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,668
Tell me what you think.

711
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:13,472
They resemble.

712
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:17,576
You can see the nose,
the cheekbones, the mouth.

713
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:20,379
I mean, it clearly looks
like the same person to me.

714
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,715
I've seen 1,000, 2,000
sketches done

715
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:24,316
from witnesses on crimes.

716
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,418
This is pretty damn close.

717
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,720
Yeah.

718
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,155
What else?

719
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,691
I was in
the dining room,

720
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:37,463
and I saw people
practicing spiritualism.

721
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:41,500
So I would put this back
between 1901 and 1920.

722
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,703
And then I was upstairs.

723
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm sitting there,
and I see a male
coming into the room,

724
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:53,045
and he has an EMF meter,
and he's taking pictures.

725
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:56,782
And this seemed to be
pretty dang recent.

726
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:59,752
Now, I don't know anything
about spiritualists,

727
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:03,088
but Kim did bring in
a paranormal team

728
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,623
to do an investigation.

729
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,526
Okay.
Now, I spoke with them...

730
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,795
Okay.
...and they did use EMFs.

731
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:11,897
Obviously,
they took photos.

732
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:13,332
Okay.

733
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:16,068
Now, do you think these guys
might have stirred things up?

734
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:19,872
I don't think so.

735
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:24,276
But the spiritualists may...

736
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:27,046
have done something
in the past

737
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,114
that agitated the dead
so much

738
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:32,084
they may now try
to physically harm people.

739
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:39,324
The other thing I got
was a<i> massive</i> amount

740
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:42,761
of depression and loss.

741
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,631
I felt that this was due
to a living person.

742
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,332
This person is female.

743
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:50,936
Something happened
to a person that they love.

744
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,073
They can't recover
from this grief.

745
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:58,277
I got that they're not eating,
and that they feel suicidal.

746
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,647
You okay?

747
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,417
Amy, you remember
when I told you

748
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,919
that Kim was breaking
my heart?

749
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,454
That's because
her husband died

750
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,456
a couple years ago
at a very young age.

751
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,891
I actually have a photo of him
right here with Kim.

752
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:16,295
He was
the love of my life.

753
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:21,433
And we were
supposed to spend

754
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,435
the rest of our lives
in that house.

755
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,838
It wasn't particularly
one he cared for,

756
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,440
but he said
if it's my dream,

757
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,943
it will become
his dream, too.

758
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,945
She feels guilty.

759
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,680
I feel like something
in the house

760
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,682
could have killed him.

761
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:38,550
Kim, tell her
what he passed from.

762
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:43,021
He passed away
of a malignant brain tumor

763
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:44,857
that was inoperable.

764
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,392
None of us
were prepared for that.

765
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:50,429
If it was his time,
I can accept that.

766
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:55,567
But if it was me...
convincing him to
buy that house,

767
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:59,805
and something in it
that was dark hurt him,

768
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,108
I couldn't
forgive myself.

769
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,410
She's worried about

770
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,679
Gabrielle coming back
to live at the house,

771
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,182
and maybe something in the house
could do something to her.

772
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:12,050
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter,

773
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,554
and I certainly don't
want her to move back
home if something --

774
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:19,625
I didn't even know about
the dark mass over her bed.

775
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:23,061
She never told me that.

776
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:25,831
I'm tired.
Yeah.

777
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,332
I know you are.

778
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:31,303
So what else
was going on?

779
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,572
At the foot of the stairs,

780
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:36,275
what I felt was a male
in his death state.

781
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:38,877
It was not a good death.
It took a while.

782
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:41,480
I felt
overwhelming sadness.

783
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:43,148
I kept hearing,

784
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,617
"Man. This is wrong.
No way, no way.

785
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,586
This can't be happening.
No way."

786
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:50,122
I felt he was scared.

787
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,823
Angel passed away
downstairs, right?

788
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:52,991
In the master bedroom.

789
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,694
So not that far away.

790
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,764
Okay, I'm hoping Amy
wasn't feeling Angel's death,

791
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:01,400
but the other things that she
described about him being scared

792
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,435
and saying,
"This can't happen,"

793
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:06,205
does that sound like
what Angel was going through?

794
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,140
All of the stages
you go through

795
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:10,576
when you find out
that you have cancer,

796
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:12,911
he experienced them all.
We all did.

797
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:15,914
I got to ask you, Amy --
do you think that's
Angel that you felt?

798
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,283
I'm sorry.
I wish I knew for sure.

799
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,552
But I could not see him.

800
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,188
Obviously, it's not
a definitive answer for you.

801
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,256
What's your gut tell you?

802
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:27,759
That he's at peace
where he is...

803
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:31,863
and I'm the one struggling
with being not at peace.

804
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:36,168
Anything else?

805
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,170
So, here's the thing.

806
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:41,106
There is random dead

807
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:44,309
who are constantly
coming through your house.

808
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:48,180
So these dead can come and go
through the mirrors.

809
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:50,549
I've encountered this before
on walks,

810
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:53,785
and basically some mirrors,
for whatever reason,

811
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:56,788
which I think
it's more about the location,

812
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,194
are openings for the dead
to come and go through.

813
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,997
What bothered me about that
bed location, the master bed,

814
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,432
is that they're
literally walking back,

815
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,636
like, through that bed,
constant, constant.

816
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,537
You're consistently exposed.

817
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,540
That is something
that can make you sick.

818
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,643
After Angel passed away,

819
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:20,812
I always wake up
with aches in my side,

820
00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:24,616
said I felt like I'm actually
being punched in my sleep.

821
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:28,587
Yeah, that would be them
probably walking through you.

822
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:31,590
So if she doesn't call us in
and Gabrielle moved in,

823
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:33,091
what could have happened?

824
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:36,161
I think that you would've
eventually developed

825
00:37:36,163 --> 00:37:40,132
some kind of long-term
and possibly terminal illness

826
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,434
by continuing
to sleep here.

827
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:45,103
You know, you're talking
about all these dead
people walking through.

828
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:47,005
You had an incident with Angel
when he was alive

829
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:48,607
that you thought
it wasn't him.

830
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:51,076
I believe
he was possessed.

831
00:37:51,078 --> 00:37:52,277
He didn't look the same.

832
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,079
His voice
was not the same.

833
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,148
And I actually remember
stepping back

834
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,949
because I was fearful

835
00:37:57,951 --> 00:38:01,787
because when I looked at him,
he wasn't my husband.

836
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:04,523
Now, could this be
from people walking through?

837
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,458
I think so.

838
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,362
It makes complete sense to me
that he would be possessed.

839
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:13,165
Yeah, you got to get
the...out of there, like...

840
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,233
And now I'm...

841
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,668
worried.

842
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,871
So the big question is,
did the house make Angel sick?

843
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:26,044
No. I don't think so.

844
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,846
So you didn't cause this.

845
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,247
You understand that?

846
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,651
Okay.

847
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:38,190
At least he got a chance
to love me before he...

848
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,325
before he died.

849
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:43,261
So even though it
was for a short time,
it was worth it.

850
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:48,467
Everybody's gonna grieve.

851
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:52,104
But the guilt part
you got to let go.

852
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:54,539
- Okay.
- Okay?

853
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:57,509
I made her cry.

854
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:03,515
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,099
So, Kim, if you only get
one thing out of tonight,

856
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:23,071
I hope you now know
you had nothing to do
with Angel's death.

857
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:25,774
As far as whether it's safe
for you to stay in the house

858
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:28,309
or to have Gabrielle
move back in,

859
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:30,111
I'm going to turn it over
to Amy.

860
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:35,350
Before I get to that,
I am going to go into

861
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:38,520
what you need to do to heal

862
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:41,089
and take care of yourself.

863
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:47,328
The first thing is to
see a psychotherapist
who specializes in grief

864
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,631
for intensive therapy.

865
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:55,637
And also, I want you
in a grief-counseling group

866
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,873
because the pain
is stuck.

867
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,009
I need to do that.

868
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:06,080
I didn't actually realize
that I was...so stuck

869
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:08,716
emotionally...

870
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:11,252
in the grieving...state.

871
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:15,023
As for the hauntings,

872
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:18,193
the first thing is
you have to move your bedroom.

873
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:20,528
That has to happen.
I'm sorry.

874
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,730
But this is your health,

875
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:27,368
so that needs
to be done ASAP.

876
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,537
Next, you need
to remove both mirrors,

877
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,439
specifically downstairs.

878
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:32,774
They're contaminated.

879
00:40:32,776 --> 00:40:35,944
You need to get rid
of those mirrors.

880
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:39,647
The next thing is
a medium needs to come in

881
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:44,085
to remove...
most of the dead.

882
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:48,456
They'll be able to get
rid of the black mass
and this guy here.

883
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,757
Okay.

884
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,360
What about your daughter?

885
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,362
You going to have her move in
after you get this done?

886
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,831
I don't think
I'll have her move in.

887
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:01,369
Feels like
I could cause harm to her.

888
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:03,972
I hate to see you
in this house by yourself.

889
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,307
When the time comes,
when I feel comfortable,

890
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,775
she can move back.

891
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:11,112
How do you feel about the whole
investigation, how it went?

892
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,615
I have the answers
I wanted

893
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:15,083
and that I needed

894
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:17,485
because you have a gift.

895
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:20,688
And you help
a lot of people,

896
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,357
whether you realize it
or not,

897
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,292
so thank you.

898
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,898
I really hope Kim seeks the help
of a therapist and support group

899
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,601
to deal with the guilt she feels
over her husband's death.

900
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:37,272
If she does that and contacts
a medium to remove the dead,

901
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:38,540
she can begin to heal

902
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,776
and maybe even live here
in peace with her daughter.
