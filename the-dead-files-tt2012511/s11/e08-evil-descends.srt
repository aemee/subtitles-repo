1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,911
He is<i> pissed,</i>

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,215
and he does not want us
to go back here.

3
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,784
He was doing some sort
of witchcraft.

4
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:22,187
Witchcraft is done,
so it's almost like a curse.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,590
Somebody is on top of me,
choking me.

6
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,960
They felt somebody.

7
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:31,196
I want to leave.
I just want to move.

8
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,999
I'm panicking.
I want to get out of here.

9
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,002
This is not a good situation.

10
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,204
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,406
There's death here.

12
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,508
Don't wanna go down there.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,842
I see dead people.

14
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,711
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,547
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,083
She's definitely
a serial killer.

17
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,684
...and they speak to me.

18
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,387
She is going to torture them.

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,891
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,959
They were all murdered.

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,561
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,062
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,998
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,567
So is this the only time
you're been physically attacked?

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,504
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:16,208
There is no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

27
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,143
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,678
Who do you think
possessed you?

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,513
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,615
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,850
...until the very end.

32
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,418
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,887
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,289
<i>Hell,</i> no.

35
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,657
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,060
Everyone is in jeopardy.

37
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,506
I'm in Murrieta, California.

38
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,142
It's about an hour and a half
in from L.A.

39
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,179
I got a call from a woman
named Lina. Sounds real bad.

40
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,448
She's convinced
whatever's in the house

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,485
is going after her husband
and her 15-year-old daughter.

42
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,186
Now, this is a woman
who is religious,

43
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,655
doesn't like to mess around
with the paranormal,

44
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,058
but she's so desperate,
she called us in.

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,160
I really hope we can
help her out.

46
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,130
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,534
I clear the area
of any leading information.

48
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,470
This home has
a lot of photographs

49
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,340
and religious symbols,

50
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,176
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

51
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,279
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,761
There's so much noise out here.

53
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,064
It's...like, ridiculous.

54
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,470
I don't like it.

55
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:54,339
It's making me feel
<i>extremely</i> uncomfortable.

56
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,974
I'm panicking.
I don't like this.

57
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,644
I want to run.
I want to get out of here.

58
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,612
This is very bad.

59
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,023
So, Lina,
I'm glad I'm here.

60
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:14,293
I mean, you sounded really upset
on the phone when we spoke.

61
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,961
Now, what do you think
is here?

62
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,429
I think it's something evil.

63
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,565
Whatever it is,
I think it's something

64
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:23,835
that is just wanting
to harm my family.

65
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,304
How long have you guys
lived here?

66
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,972
We've been for 11 years.

67
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,941
Now, have you had activity
since the beginning?

68
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,978
We only started having activity
about the last 31/2, 4 years.

69
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,446
You have any theories
as to why?

70
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,948
My husband, we had
an acquaintance

71
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,151
that was dealing with
some occult things,

72
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,553
and my husband
brought something home.

73
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,921
Help me out here.

74
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,691
What exactly do you think
this guy was involved with?

75
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,560
All I know is that
he told my husband

76
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,029
that he was doing
some sort of witchcraft

77
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,565
to become more popular.

78
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,000
Almost like
a deal with the devil.

79
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,134
Yes.

80
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,436
Was your husband involved
in this stuff?

81
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,106
No, but he is
very sensitive.

82
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,142
Okay. So, Lina, who exactly
lives in the house?

83
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,478
- This is my family.
- Okay.

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,580
That's my husband, Sal.

85
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,717
my son, Allan, who's 21,

86
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,218
myself,

87
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,188
my daughter, Mei,
who is 20,

88
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,689
and Emily is 15.

89
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,091
All right.
Lina, do me a favor.

90
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,460
Give me an overview of what
you guys are going through.

91
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,528
We've got noises.

92
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,131
We've got things
moving on their own.

93
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,700
We've got physical attacks,

94
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,970
nightmares,
and personality changes.

95
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,338
All right.

96
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,539
Personality changes -- what
are you talking about here?

97
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,542
Mostly in my youngest
daughter and my husband.

98
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,844
Let's start with Sal.

99
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,579
What kind of personality changes
are we talking about?

100
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,215
He'll change from being
normal and happy

101
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,651
to being completely depressed
for no reason.

102
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,120
All right. Now, was he
ever like this before?

103
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,254
- No.
- Okay.

104
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,356
So your daughter Emily,
how has she changed?

105
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:55,227
With her, it's very severe
anxiety and depression.

106
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,029
She doesn't leave
the house anymore.

107
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,297
It's very hard on her
and myself as well.

108
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,233
How you holding up?

109
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,670
I'm exhausted all the time,
lethargic.

110
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,038
I mean, you break my heart
when I listen to you.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,140
And you have nobody
to turn to?

112
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,842
No. You know, this is
my last resort,

113
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:15,080
and I want to have my family
whole, back together again.

114
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,481
Okay.

115
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,318
There's these things.

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,189
They look like little lizard
gremlin things.

117
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,724
They're running around
and they're, like,

118
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,293
doing this weird...

119
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,163
pitched laughing giggle.

120
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,668
To me, what I'm thinking is that
they're little, like,

121
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,204
low, low, low level demons.

122
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:44,476
They create an atmosphere
of depression and lethargy.

123
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,045
I don't know why they're
attached to the living here,

124
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,480
but they are.

125
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,783
They just make it impossible
to get anywhere in your life.

126
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,286
It's almost like
they're sent, though.

127
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,622
There might be something behind
that where witchcraft is done,

128
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,591
and so it's almost like a curse.

129
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,400
So, Lina,
what's going on in here?

130
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,936
We've had several
experiences around here.

131
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,305
One of them was
the door here

132
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,108
slammed by itself
very aggressively.

133
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,143
All right. So how hard are
we talking about?

134
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,212
- I mean, did it...
- Very hard.

135
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,549
- Like that?
- Yes, if not harder.

136
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,552
Okay. So you didn't have any
of the windows in here open?

137
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,821
- No.
- All right. Anything else?

138
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:34,392
I saw a very tall, dark figure
running through our house

139
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,995
from the hallway
into the kitchen

140
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,698
and with very,
very heavy footsteps.

141
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,999
How tall do you think
this thing was?

142
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,501
About 7 to 8 feet tall.

143
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,236
Are you sure it couldn't have
been anything from outside?

144
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,670
No.

145
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,706
So, Lina, obviously,
you cannot go on like this,

146
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,307
you or your family.

147
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,844
I need help, and I want...

148
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,214
It's okay.

149
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,316
You want your family back.

150
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,318
I want them
to be healthy again...

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,621
- Okay.
- ...and back to normal.

152
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,357
You've put a lot
on your shoulders.

153
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,226
Hopefully, we'll have tears
of joy when we're done, okay?

154
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,796
I hope so.

155
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,101
Not good. Really not good.

156
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,770
I just saw a body
in the ground here.

157
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,340
I believe that this is...

158
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,575
a female.

159
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:29,147
There's something with her,

160
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,549
an illness,

161
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,852
and I think that is affecting
the living here.

162
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,854
Do you know how it's
affecting the living?

163
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:40,725
Sudden onset of nausea,
being extremely drained.

164
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,329
They feel exhausted
all the time

165
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,266
and also, like, this anxiety.

166
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,368
Fear.

167
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,940
She does not like the person
in this room at all.

168
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,609
At all.

169
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,511
Why?

170
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:04,316
Basically, she's calling
this person a beast.

171
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,426
So, Sal, I was talking
to your wife, Lina,

172
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,128
and she's worried about
your youngest, Emily.

173
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,064
Yeah, she's not doing well.

174
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,868
It's the worst pain, that real
pain in my heart, you know?

175
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,871
Lina, she said that your
personality has changed.

176
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,038
I mean,
you agree with that?

177
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,075
Yes.
I get angry really fast.

178
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,810
I wasn't like that before.

179
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:36,414
And then anxiety
and then depression,

180
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,782
and it's getting worse.

181
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,418
Sometimes I just cry.

182
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,721
You're going through
a lot, Sal.
Yes.

183
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,922
So, Sal,
I was talking to Lina,

184
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,324
and she has a theory
that about 4 years ago,

185
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,226
you were talking to some guy
that was practicing

186
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,629
some kind of
weird witchcraft.-

187
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,063
And that whatever
he was doing,

188
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,265
something might have
attached to you.

189
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,933
Do you agree with that?

190
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:59,738
Yeah, because I'm actually
open to that stuff somehow.

191
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,539
I don't know how.

192
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,174
So what about
experiences, Sal?

193
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,577
I have terrible nightmares.

194
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,178
Can you describe them
at all?

195
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,448
I feel like somebody, like,
is, like, on top of me

196
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,319
and won't let me move.

197
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,389
Have you ever been tested
for any kind of sleep disorder?

198
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,324
- No.
- Okay.

199
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,426
To me, it sounds
like sleep paralysis.

200
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,460
But what do you think it is?

201
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,730
I think he is a real devil.

202
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,098
The demon is, like,
on top of me.

203
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,467
He's grabbing me
and choking me.

204
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,070
- Okay.
- So I can die in the nightmare.

205
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,077
The dead girl wants to leave.
She wants out.

206
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,613
This living person is aware

207
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:45,850
that something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

208
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,657
I know that they felt, you know,

209
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:56,027
like somebody trying
to strangle them.

210
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,965
I don't think they know that
they're actually not dreaming,

211
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,833
so they are awake.

212
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,136
They're being strangled.
They're being smothered.

213
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:09,374
The dead girl, she's figuring
out how to...kill this person.

214
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:33,047
I was talking to Mom and Dad.
You're the oldest, right?

215
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,215
- Yeah.
- How old are you?

216
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,583
21 years old.

217
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,786
Do you have any concern about
dad and your younger sister?

218
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,189
Yeah, they have changed.

219
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,358
They feel so different
and distant.

220
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,227
Everybody seems to be having all
kinds of different experiences.

221
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,796
What about yourself?

222
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,364
I have really bad nightmares.

223
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,666
Now, your father
described nightmares.

224
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:52,867
Yeah.

225
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,035
Now, what kind of nightmares
are you having?

226
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,503
All of a sudden, something,
whether it be, like,

227
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,038
a person or anything,

228
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,673
it would just become, like,
a dark shadow

229
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:03,044
that'll eventually become,
like, a human-sized figure.

230
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,713
- But is it threatening to you?
- Yeah.

231
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,649
All right. So anything else?

232
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:10,652
When I'm sleeping, I'll feel
like something is shaking me,

233
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,687
and I'll wake up
in real life.

234
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,089
Okay. So you're sure
it's not a dream,

235
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,357
or do you think you're being
really physically shaken?

236
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,859
I'm being really
physically shaken,

237
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,461
and it'll feel like
a shake enough

238
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:21,563
to where
it will move me back.

239
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,264
What do you think
is going on?

240
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,933
I feel like whatever is
happening is kind of trying

241
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,301
to divide my family,

242
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,203
at least when it comes to my dad
and my youngest sister.

243
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:30,438
They're like two different
versions of people

244
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,273
that I used to know.

245
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,741
Okay.

246
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:41,015
I'm seeing, like,
this angry dead man, old,

247
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:44,519
and he is...pissed.

248
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,325
and he does not
want us to go back here.

249
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,327
He doesn't like living people.

250
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,329
He hates this...family.

251
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:57,565
They don't respect him.
They all deserve what they get.

252
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,402
Okay.

253
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,404
So I'm seeing kind of
a weird thing here.

254
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,875
So I'm seeing a person
laying in the bed.

255
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:10,979
It's a male, probably anywhere
from, like, 15 to 21.

256
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:16,217
The little old man
is on top of this male.

257
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,419
There is some sketchy...
going on here.

258
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,562
Seems like there is a lot
of things going on in the house.

259
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,197
Have you had any experiences?

260
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,167
Yeah, I always hear
running along the roof.

261
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,737
- Does it sound like an animal?
- No.

262
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:40,208
It sounds like a person
with really heavy shoes.

263
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,676
Okay. So anything else?

264
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,914
I have been felt like
I'm being watched all the time.

265
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,615
Where do you feel it?

266
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:50,084
Usually sleeping, and then
I'll randomly get up

267
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,387
and, like, look at
every corner of my room,

268
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,889
and I'll feel, like,
a really heavy stare on me.

269
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,258
But does it feel like somebody
that wants to do you harm?

270
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,493
Yeah.

271
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,796
This is the worst room.

272
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:05,433
It's interesting,
with the curtains.

273
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,002
Literally, like,
a doorway for the dead,

274
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:11,472
coming and going,
coming and going.

275
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:15,877
So this person, definitely
a medium, without a doubt.

276
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,346
They're getting bad,
crazy-ass dead people.

277
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,848
I do think that they would
cause this person

278
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,585
to feel overwhelmed and sad.

279
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:29,891
Your mom called us in, and she's
really concerned about you.

280
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,494
She thinks you've
changed emotionally.

281
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,996
- Yeah.
- Do you agree with that?

282
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,998
- Yes.
- What's going on?

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
I have anxiety and depression,

284
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:42,203
and, like, ever since
the activity started,

285
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:44,005
I never want to leave
the house.

286
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,673
That's not really normal
for a 15-year-old.

287
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,642
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,410
Is it affecting you
physically, too?

289
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,213
Yes, I am really drained
of my energy.

290
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:54,449
Sometimes I'll stand up
and I'll, like,

291
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,418
see black for, like, a minute.

292
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,687
If we can figure out a way
to fix whatever the hell

293
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,456
is going on here,

294
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,758
would you want to stay,
or do you still want to go?

295
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,293
I want to leave.

296
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,396
I just want to move away
from this property.

297
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:10,198
Okay. That's sad, honey.

298
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:17,905
One of the things that
I'm getting about this area,

299
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:21,275
and then specifically now,
this room,

300
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,145
is these tall beings,

301
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:27,382
that are ancient.

302
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:30,752
They were here before man,

303
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:37,859
and the dead were talking
about them coming from the sky,

304
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:41,229
and so that does make me
think that these are aliens.

305
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,133
I see them coming in

306
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,736
and abducting people
in this house.

307
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:51,439
How might they be affected
by that?

308
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,141
Irrational fears.

309
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,245
Most abductees have issues with
certain noises and frequencies,

310
00:14:57,247 --> 00:15:00,682
sleep issues, nightmares.

311
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:03,317
And the harm it can do, I think,

312
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,919
to a person physically
and mentally

313
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,522
and emotionally
is pretty severe.

314
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:27,115
Sal is such a sweet
and sincere guy,

315
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:30,452
and I know he believes his
nightmares and sleep paralysis

316
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,354
come from the paranormal.

317
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:33,789
But I called a local doctor,

318
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,759
and he says it could just be
symptoms of sleep apnea.

319
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,795
So I had Sal do a home test.

320
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,397
He put on this contraption,
went to sleep wearing it,

321
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,000
and all the data was recorded.

322
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:46,902
Right now, I'm heading over
to meet that doctor

323
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,770
to go over these test results.

324
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,712
Well, Doctor, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

325
00:15:57,714 --> 00:16:01,883
So my client is suffering from
nightmares and sleep paralysis.

326
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:04,953
Now you mentioned sleep apnea
could be the cause of this?

327
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,988
What are the other
symptoms of that?

328
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,791
It can cause insomnia,
fatigue,

329
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,693
mood swings and depression.

330
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,528
Okay. Now, would he feel like
he was being choked?

331
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,230
Sometimes people feel like
they're gasping.

332
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,665
They can't get enough air,

333
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,999
and they'll wake up...

334
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,001
feeling like they're choking.

335
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:22,871
If this goes on for a long
time, what could happen?

336
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,940
Typically, that's going
to be hypertension,

337
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,909
high blood pressure,
sometimes heart failure.

338
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:31,046
So, Doc, I know you normally
test people here at your office,

339
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:35,417
but my client slept with this
contraption at home last night.

340
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,219
So you had a chance
to look at the results?

341
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,820
- Yes.
- All right, Doc.

342
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:40,222
So what are we looking
at here?

343
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,357
So what we're looking at
is breathing pattern up here.

344
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,593
All right. So does this mean
he has sleep apnea?

345
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:47,128
It does not appear to be
sleep apnea at all.

346
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,965
So all the symptoms he's got
as far as nightmares,

347
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,933
the feeling of being choked,
depression,

348
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:54,402
all this other stuff, it's not
coming from any sleep disorder?

349
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:57,172
It doesn't seem like it's coming
from obstructive sleep apnea.

350
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:59,641
Okay.

351
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,943
I'm seeing
the dead girl again.

352
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:05,213
I don't think the living
can sleep while she's around.

353
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,482
I think that they're aware
enough that they know

354
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,485
that something really bad
actually is happening.

355
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,957
I think they're like,
"No," you know,

356
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,126
"that was just a dream,"
but they are fighting it.

357
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,261
They're fighting it.

358
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,229
Something weird's going on.

359
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,168
So I made my usual calls,

360
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,337
and this local historian
reached out to tell me

361
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,474
the Native Americans
got a raw deal in this city.

362
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,809
Listen, I hear that
pretty much everywhere we go,

363
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,444
but she says this is different.

364
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,113
There were two major incidents,

365
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:40,315
and one of them involved
the original owner

366
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,117
of Sal and Lina's property.

367
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,989
What can you tell me
about the Native Americans

368
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,357
that inhabited the land here?

369
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,559
'Cause I know we're close
to my clients' property.

370
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,694
Yeah, they were the Luiseños,

371
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,496
and they lived here
hundreds of years

372
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:59,067
before the Spanish settlers
came in the mid-1800s.

373
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,435
You mentioned on the phone
there were two incidents

374
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:01,503
involving
the Native Americans.

375
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:02,871
What's the first one?

376
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,941
Well, the first one is,
the Luiseños had some horses,

377
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:09,210
and there were Spanish settlers
called Californios

378
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,780
that came in
and stole their horses.

379
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,181
Okay.

380
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,749
The Luiseños took the law
into their own hands

381
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:18,453
and killed all 11
of the Californios,

382
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:21,122
along with
a 13-year-old boy.

383
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:22,490
- Over horses?
- Yes.

384
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,327
All right. So did
the Californios get any revenge?

385
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,062
Yeah.
They were furious.

386
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,431
So what they did is,
they set up an ambush,

387
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,900
and from that,
they massacred them all.

388
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,134
How many of these guys
did they kill?

389
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,202
About 38 to 40.

390
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,937
All right.
So that's a lot of bodies.

391
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,505
Did they just
leave them there?

392
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,443
This is why I brought you here,
because they had a mass grave,

393
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,511
and they buried them
somewhere over here.

394
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,946
- By the shopping mall?
- Yes.

395
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:47,248
All right. So did they
at least dig up the bodies,

396
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,751
or did they
just build over it?

397
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,386
They just built
right over it.

398
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,426
There are
a lot of dead people here,

399
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,162
just wandering the streets.

400
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:05,734
There were three
or four places of burial,

401
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,603
and I think that
all of these burial areas

402
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,538
were from different
time periods,

403
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,541
like, 1600s, 1700s.

404
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,411
These areas where bodies
were placed

405
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:20,181
that were just ignored
and built upon,

406
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,950
and so they're not at rest,

407
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,152
and they haven't
ever been at rest.

408
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:26,321
These dead people are
kind of pissed about it.

409
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:27,555
They're not happy.

410
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,691
All right, Yvette,
you mentioned on the phone

411
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:31,026
there was a second incident

412
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,961
that involved the original owner
of my clients' property.

413
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,530
- Who was this guy?
- His name was Juan Murrieta,

414
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,966
and they actually named
this town after him.

415
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,502
Okay.
He was born and raised
in Spain,

416
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,105
and he arrived here
in California in 1861.

417
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:48,576
Here is a picture of him
when he was in his early 30s,

418
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:52,681
and then here's another photo
when he was in his 80s.

419
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:55,550
All right. So what did he
wind up doing with the property?

420
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,886
He ended up raising sheep
on the property,

421
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:01,022
and he built this house
on the property.

422
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,757
Okay. So you said
there was an incident

423
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,926
with the Native Americans.
What happened?

424
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:08,363
Murrieta's sheep were getting
into the Luiseños lands

425
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:10,365
and eating up
the crops and whatnot,

426
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,801
and so they got into
an argument.

427
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,135
Okay.
So what did Murrieta do?

428
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:17,072
Well, Murrieta decided
to evict them,

429
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:20,041
and here is their decree
right here.

430
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,810
Okay. So he throws them off
the property?

431
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,044
How many?

432
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,246
- There were 200.
- What happened after that?

433
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:28,116
They were living in squalor
for at least 7 years,

434
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:30,985
and many of them
were starving and dying.

435
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,487
So this guy Murrieta
from the photo

436
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,755
looks like he lived
a long time.

437
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:37,092
Yes, he died in 1936
at the age of 91.

438
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:39,728
- He died a rich man.
- Guy's a real piece of work.

439
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:44,599
I'm seeing
the angry old man again.

440
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:48,002
Do you have any idea
who this person was in life?

441
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:50,872
He was not born
in California,

442
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,974
so I think he does speak
another language.

443
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,143
I think he did come from Mexico.

444
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:59,180
He was more than likely
pretty poor,

445
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:02,784
and then he either came into
money or made his own money,

446
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:06,087
and he's showing me animals
that he had or something.

447
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,893
He thinks it's his house.

448
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,696
"These people need to go.
This is my house.

449
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,264
Everybody stole it from me."

450
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,366
He's just going nuts.

451
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:24,773
He's crazy.

452
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,347

458
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,517
So far I have a family
living in the middle

459
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,486
of a paranormal war zone

460
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,955
on a property where
Native Americans were abused,

461
00:21:56,957 --> 00:22:00,058
neglected, and killed.

462
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,828
But I want to see what else
happened here.

463
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,130
Searching through old records,

464
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,898
I find an article
about a young girl

465
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,069
who was brutally murdered
in 1996.

466
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,304
Turns out the homicide
took place less than a mile

467
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:17,609
from my clients' property.

468
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:19,677
All right, I called the cops
about this homicide,

469
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,446
but they said they don't want
to talk to me about it

470
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:24,416
because one of the suspects
is still on the loose.

471
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:27,385
So I'm meeting with a true crime
author who says this murder

472
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,254
was one of
the most savage crimes

473
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,523
in Murrieta's history.

474
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:41,065
So, Aleida, thanks for
helping me out with this case.

475
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,300
Before we get to
the homicide,

476
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:43,501
what do we know
about this victim?

477
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:45,770
Well, her name
was Sophia Briseno.

478
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:47,739
She was only 13 years old.

479
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,241
She lived only about
900 feet from the property

480
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,609
that you're investigating,

481
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:54,946
and she had a boyfriend that
she'd been secretly dating.

482
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:56,314
He was 17 years old.

483
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,684
His name was
Crispin Solorio Garcia.

484
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:01,019
All right.
So what happened?

485
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:05,590
Well, on February 12th of 1996,
Garcia calls Sophia,

486
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,461
and he asked her to meet him
at this local grocery store.

487
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:11,262
And so she meets him there,

488
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,966
and he is there with his
friend, Francisco Ochoa.

489
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:16,167
Okay.

490
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,436
Well, they all went
to a local cemetery,

491
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,739
which is a place that a lot
of the kids would party at.

492
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,843
And I actually have a picture
here of the cemetery.

493
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,981
- I mean, a cemetery, really?
- A cemetery.

494
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:32,550
So, Aleida, how far is this
cemetery from my clients' house?

495
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,586
It's only about 2,400 feet.

496
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:38,256
Okay. So they're there partying.
How'd it go bad?

497
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:41,226
Well, Sophia started
irritating Garcia.

498
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:44,963
He gets upset, and he
tells her to shut up.

499
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,798
"Just shut up,
or I'm gonna kill you."

500
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,833
At this point,
Sophia doesn't stop.

501
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:52,637
She keeps going, and, according
to the police, he tells Ochoa,

502
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,240
"Go to my truck
and get some screwdrivers."

503
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,975
Garcia takes a screwdriver

504
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,111
and he just starts
to viciously stab Sophia,

505
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:02,580
and as he's stabbing her,
he shouts at her,

506
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:05,049
"Do you believe me now...
that I'm gonna kill you?"

507
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:11,523
This dead girl is in
so much pain.

508
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,659
Did you get anymore
information on her life?

509
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,862
I know that she was young.
She had black hair.

510
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:21,432
There's something
with her jaw...

511
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:27,605
...with how she died. It hurts.

512
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:29,374
And then her back.

513
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:35,280
Okay. So this is
a pretty savage attack.

514
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:37,682
I mean, when all is said
and done, what was the damage?

515
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,084
Well, she was stabbed
64 times.

516
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:43,488
She was stabbed in the chest,
in her face, in her jaw,

517
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,057
in her neck,
in her head, in her back.

518
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,026
I mean, she was
just stabbed everywhere.

519
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,329
And I actually have
her death certificate here.

520
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:54,065
These guys are animals.
I mean, real savages.

521
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,401
- Absolutely.
- What do they do next?

522
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:59,938
Well, they just leave her body
there to rot, out in the open.

523
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,307
The day before Sophia's body
is actually found,

524
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,641
they flee to Mexico.

525
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:05,710
I know one guy was
apprehended. What happened?

526
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,514
So in 2007,
the FBI locates Garcia.

527
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:11,983
He's extradited
back to the United States

528
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,885
and then he stands trial
for her murder.

529
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,989
This is actually
his mug shot.

530
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,358
He is convicted
of first-degree murder

531
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,627
and sentenced
to 25 years to life.

532
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:25,096
He is incarcerated
in California.

533
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,631
And what about Ochoa?

534
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,566
Well, Ochoa has
never been caught.

535
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,668
He's still out there.

536
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:36,941
All I know
about this dead chick

537
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:39,877
is that she definitely
was murdered.

538
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,882
It was fairly recently.

539
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:46,918
When would you say then?

540
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,322
I would say
maybe the 1970s, 1980s,

541
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,725
could be even closer than that.

542
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:59,664
Was her body literally,
literally here?

543
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,800
She doesn't know.
So she died in the ground?

544
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:06,471
So she's showing me
she's in the ground, right?

545
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:08,539
Now she's looking at her body.

546
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,874
She's naked.

547
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:12,010
Her hair is all wet,
caked with mud, you know?

548
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:15,780
And she's looking at herself,
and then she's lifting up,

549
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,115
and she's in the house.

550
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,519
And that's the last
she remembers.

551
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,064
There is a lot of activity
in this house,

552
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,733
but one of the things
I'm really worried about

553
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:38,836
is the pathway of dead
in one of the bedrooms.

554
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:42,774
The dead that I saw,
they were translucent.

555
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:45,777
They did have, like,
little wispy arms.

556
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,079
And they were
all over the place.

557
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:56,487
Amy, is this what you saw?

558
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,789
Yes.

559
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,619
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

560
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,754
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

561
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,290
and our clients
for the first time

562
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:27,226
Well, Amy, you're looking across
at a family in crisis.

563
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,461
This is Sal.

564
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,998
This is his wife, Lina,
and their son, Allen.

565
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,133
They also have
two other daughters.

566
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,837
This is Mei, who is 20,
and this is Emily, who is 15.

567
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,673
Now everyone is having
experiences, but Sal and Emily

568
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:42,141
are getting the worst of it.

569
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,076
They brought us in to stop
whatever's here

570
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,478
before someone gets hurt,

571
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,414
and so they can go back to being
a loving and caring family.

572
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,250
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

573
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,919
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

574
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:58,157
When I got here,

575
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,260
I saw these little things.

576
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,864
They kind of looked like a cross
between a lizard and a gremlin.

577
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:06,632
There was about 12 of 'em.

578
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,402
They have little tails
and little horns.

579
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:13,439
What these things are,
are, like, low-level demons.

580
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,108
The things that they can
cause are, like,

581
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,077
feelings of depression,

582
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,214
feelings of being
completely overwhelmed.

583
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:25,518
They also can make you feel like
you're not succeeding in life.

584
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,688
Sal, why don't we start with you
and talk about the anxiety,

585
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,923
the negative thoughts,
the depression?

586
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:34,527
It's been, like, 4 years
since this happening to me.

587
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,062
That makes me really sad.

588
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:40,933
That's where I'm getting all
my anxiety and my depression.

589
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:44,303
The thing is, is that
these things are summoned.

590
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,572
I got that someone
practicing witchcraft

591
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,908
brought them here
as a curse.

592
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,343
Now, Lina, do me a favor.

593
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,145
I want to you to tell Amy what
you think, how this all started.

594
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:57,783
I suspect that Sal brought
something home with him

595
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,151
on one occasion.

596
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,187
He had an acquaintance
that was dealing

597
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:04,357
with some sort of
witchcraft.

598
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,225
He started having
nightmares that night,

599
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:10,129
woke up crying and just
hysterical that night,

600
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:14,567
and that's the point in time
where all of this started.

601
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,702
Now, is that what you think
may have caused all this?

602
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,605
Yeah.

603
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,841
So do you think this guy
put a curse on Sal?

604
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,476
Yeah.

605
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,311
I think that this
person got offended

606
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:26,612
that you were judging him.

607
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,347
I'm not surprised.

608
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,449
Sal, don't talk
to this other guy anymore.

609
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,184
- No.
- I will not.

610
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:35,588
'Cause that guy needs a beat.

611
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,290
All right, so what else?

612
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:42,261
The next thing that I saw was
this dead woman in that bedroom.

613
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:44,797
Okay. So that's
Sal and Lina's bedroom.

614
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,199
I got that she was, like,
keeping you awake at night,

615
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:49,635
not letting you
have peaceful sleep.

616
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:51,604
I think
she does cause nausea.

617
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:54,740
She also makes you feel
very tired.

618
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,143
She's extremely draining.

619
00:29:57,145 --> 00:30:01,380
I feel the feeling of drain,
like you were explaining,

620
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,949
that I'm always exhausted.

621
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,351
I think that you've woken up
and been, like,

622
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:08,187
feeling like you're having
a heart attack.

623
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:09,689
Maybe you were trying
to just be like,

624
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,157
"No, these are
just nightmares,

625
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,960
and this isn't really
happening," and, you know,

626
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:16,028
but it really is happening.

627
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,065
Everything you're describing
is what Sal's going through.

628
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,600
Really?

629
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,234
Sal, do me a favor
and describe

630
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:24,270
the nightmares
that you're having.

631
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:27,239
When I was sleeping,
this man attacked me.

632
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:32,111
I feel him, that he is on top
of me, and then he's choking me,

633
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:35,448
and then he doesn't me--
to move at all.

634
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,516
I start crying.

635
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,352
It feels really horrible.

636
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:41,087
Now, when Sal told me
what he was going through,

637
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,089
I thought it might
have been sleep apnea,

638
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,557
so I called a local doctor,

639
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,960
who said that condition could
cause those kinds of symptoms,

640
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,695
including depression.

641
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,797
So I had Sal tested.

642
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,667
The results came back,

643
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,769
and everything was negative.

644
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:00,339
You don't have sleep apnea, Sal.

645
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:04,677
Unfortunately, there's gotta be
another explanation for it.

646
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,845
Any idea about this dead girl,

647
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,179
or who she was
or anything like that?

648
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,181
I got that
she was pretty young.

649
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:12,918
What I saw of her was that
she was kind of, like,

650
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,887
a little bit caked in mud,

651
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,258
and she was nude, and that
she had long dark hair.

652
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,827
Just, like, a lot of jaw pain,

653
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,531
and her back was
excruciating pain.

654
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,034
I know that she was
caught off guard.

655
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:30,336
She was definitely murdered.

656
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:33,272
I was getting, like, maybe it
happened in the '70s or '80s,

657
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,142
or she might have been born
in the '70s and '80s

658
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,911
'cause it could've happened
even more recently.

659
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,946
A few things you said remind me

660
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:43,315
of a pretty gruesome homicide
I came across.

661
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:46,318
Now the victim's name
was Sophia Briseno.

662
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,121
She lived in Murrieta,
about 900 feet from this house.

663
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,589
She was only 13.

664
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:54,660
She was secretly dating a boy
named Crispin Solorio Garcia.

665
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:59,565
This kid was 17,
and on February 12, 1996,

666
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:02,001
Garcia invited Sophia
to meet with him

667
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,402
at a market in Murrieta.

668
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:04,937
Now Garcia was also
with a friend

669
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:07,139
named Francisco Gonzalez Ochoa,

670
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,408
and then they headed
to that nearby cemetery.

671
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,776
At the time, it was a place

672
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:14,213
where teenagers would
hang out and party.

673
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,515
Sophia started to get
on Garcia's nerves.

674
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,783
Garcia told her to shut up,

675
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,151
and she started
making fun of him.

676
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,287
Next thing you know, Garcia got
ahold of a screwdriver

677
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,622
and began stabbing her.

678
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:26,592
Now you said the girl was
in pain in her jaw and her back.

679
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,361
Well, this bastard
stabbed her 64 times...

680
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:30,629
My goodness.

681
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:34,433
...all around her face,
her neck, her back.

682
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:36,102
Now he basically left her
in the cemetery to rot

683
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,870
because they didn't find her
for 6 days.

684
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,772
No.

685
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,374
The two of them
then took off for Mexico.

686
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:45,778
Garcia was finally caught
and extradited in 2007.

687
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,115
He's doing life now, and I got
a mug shot of this psycho.

688
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:51,984
This is Garcia right here.

689
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:55,855
Unfortunately, Ochoa is
still on the loose.

690
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,456
I feel horrible that
that happened to her,

691
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:01,026
but I can't forgive her for
what she's doing to my family.

692
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:02,995
I feel so much anger.

693
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,500
All right.
So what else do we have?

694
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:10,870
I encountered
an angry old man,

695
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:15,174
and I do believe
that he is a big problem.

696
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:18,511
He kept claiming that
this was his house,

697
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:21,781
and he wants to push the living
out so he can be alone.

698
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:24,183
I know he can
move objects around.

699
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:27,019
I felt like the living would
more than likely see him

700
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,688
as a type of shadow person.

701
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,124
We see this shadow thing
running from that living room,

702
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:34,894
straight through here,
back in through the kitchen,

703
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,662
toward the pantry.

704
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:41,467
I saw him often in
the middle bedroom, I think.

705
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,935
That's Allan's room.

706
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,304
I got that he was bothering
a young male

707
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,640
between 15 and 21 years
of age.

708
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,008
Allan's 21.

709
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,177
I saw the male
laying on the bed,

710
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,246
and I saw him
on top of that male,

711
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,015
and I did see
the young male, like,

712
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:59,885
freaking out and struggling
and trying to get away.

713
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,187
In the nightmares that I have,

714
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,289
I'll feel like I'm being
moved in the dream,

715
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,392
only to find that I'm being
waken up or shaken in real life.

716
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,828
So him feeling like somebody
is actually shaking him

717
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,531
is actually happening?
- Yes.

718
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:13,699
Who was he?
Do you have any idea?

719
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:17,203
I got that
he was in his 70s.

720
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,104
He was not born
in the U.S.

721
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,640
I believe he was Mexican,
but I wasn't sure.

722
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,510
I got that initially
he was very poor

723
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,945
and that he either
came into money

724
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,214
or he made his own money,
and he's pissed off

725
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:31,884
because he felt like
everybody stole from him.

726
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:36,455
I know that he had quite a few
animals when he was alive,

727
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,058
but now he thinks
that he owns this house

728
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,027
because he owned the land.

729
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,362
But things are confusing

730
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:46,031
'cause they're not exactly
how they used to be.

731
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,700
I think I know who
you're talking about.

732
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,034
His name was Juan Murrieta.

733
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,903
You know, they named
the town after this guy.

734
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:54,506
Juan was born and raised in
Spain, but he came here in 1861,

735
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:57,309
and he bought this property
in 1873.

736
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,745
He lived here, but obviously
in a different structure.

737
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:03,382
I actually have a photo
of his house.

738
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:05,551
He came from a pretty modest
background, this guy,

739
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:06,919
but he ended up
making a lot of money

740
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,420
and he died pretty wealthy.

741
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:09,655
This guy was
a real piece of work.

742
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,757
After he bought the land,
he put sheep on here

743
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,259
and had them grazing.

744
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:15,995
Back then, the Native American
tribe lived in the area, too,

745
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,529
and they were called
the Luiseño.

746
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:20,332
So now he would let the sheep
run rampant all over their land

747
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,135
and eat their crops, so they
weren't too happy about it.

748
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,336
They got into it with Murrieta.

749
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,772
In 1875, Murrieta retaliated

750
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,108
by getting 200
of the Native Americans

751
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,476
kicked off the land.

752
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:32,778
Meanwhile, Murrieta did
pretty good for himself.

753
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,514
He lived a long life,
made a lot of money.

754
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:39,118
I actually managed to track down
a few photos of this guy.

755
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,755
This is him when
he's in his 30s, his 40s,

756
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:45,357
and then this is him in his 80s,
right here in the middle.

757
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,295
So is it possible
this is who you saw?

758
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:55,434
It is him.

759
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,370
Wow.

760
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:01,307
Pretty crazy walk so far.
What else is going on?

761
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:04,143
Then I ended up in

762
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:06,946
the first door
to the left down the hallway.

763
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,280
That's Emily's room.

764
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:11,317
That, to me, was
the worst room in the house.

765
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:15,254
I got straight-up that
she's a medium and very open.

766
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,589
So with that being said,

767
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:23,562
she is inadvertently attracting
a lot of dead people

768
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:27,399
into her room
through the window.

769
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,935
Lina, why don't you talk about
how Emily's changed?

770
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,006
Emily has developed all
of a sudden terrible anxiety,

771
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,608
depressive spells,
nervous breakdowns.

772
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,843
She doesn't leave the house.

773
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,678
It's a completely new person.

774
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,481
Yeah, that breaks my heart
in a million pieces

775
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:45,451
'cause I'd never seen her
like that before.

776
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,486
It's, again, very similar to
what my dad's going through,

777
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,156
but with Emily,
it's so scary.

778
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:52,825
When you're growing up
as a medium,

779
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,327
you do develop a lot of fear

780
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:59,298
'cause you've experienced
a lot of death already.

781
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,401
She probably
spontaneously opened

782
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,104
when all this stuff
came in the house.

783
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,506
- You mean the curse?
- Right.

784
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,177
Are these dead people literally
coming through the window?

785
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:16,015
Okay. So I had a sketch done
of what I saw happening.

786
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:21,987
Wow.

787
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,260
I- I honestly don't know
what to think.

788
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,936
It breaks my heart, knowing that
I can't step in front of her

789
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:41,473
and say, "I can take care
of this one."

790
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:44,476
- And is that a shadow person?
- No, no, no.

791
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:48,147
These things,
they're older than man.

792
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:52,317
They've been here forever,
and they come for the stars.

793
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:55,187
They're aliens, like,
<i>alien</i> aliens.

794
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:03,328
I don't think the entire family
has been abducted.

795
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,365
Okay. Who's been?

796
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,968
I think that specifically,
probably the male line.

797
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,203
My god.

798
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:17,776
So Sal and Allan
have been abducted?

799
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:22,147
I think that possibly
that they are abductees, yes.

800
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,417
I- I don't know what to say.

801
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,819
I don't know who to worry
about first.

802
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,787
Do I worry about me? Do I worry
about my little sister?

803
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,055
Everyone has their own
thing to deal with,

804
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,356
and I'm just trying
to figure out,

805
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:32,791
who should
I worry about first?

806
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,227
We knew there was something.
We didn't know it was that much.

807
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:55,981
So you guys look shell-shocked

808
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,883
and I can't say that
I blame you,

809
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:00,419
but it does explain
why Sal has changed so much.

810
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,887
So now the big question is,
what can you do

811
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,457
to have Emily go back
to her old self

812
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,058
and make this
a happy home again?

813
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,027
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

814
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:16,001
So the first thing
that I would like you to do

815
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:19,104
is take care of the curse.

816
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,942
My suggestion is
to go and see a<i> curandero.</i>

817
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,743
What exactly is a<i> curandero?</i>

818
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:27,713
Native Americans, they would
have a witch doctor,

819
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:31,250
and this is similar to that,
but for Latin American cultures.

820
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:34,253
Once it's reversed,

821
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:37,289
those little guys will
be gone.

822
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,360
All of that extra weight that
you've been carrying around,

823
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,195
the intense depression,

824
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,098
all of these emotions
and things

825
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,801
will just be gone.

826
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,636
So when he goes to get
the curse removed,

827
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,539
will that get rid
of the dead girl as well?

828
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:58,310
I'm really hoping that
she'll go immediately.

829
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,045
And the next thing
I would like to see

830
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:02,548
is that you have
a male medium

831
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,384
come and move on
the angry dead guy.

832
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,520
Okay.

833
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,555
As far as the alien issue,

834
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:13,893
there's really not anything
that can be done about that.

835
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:17,363
There are support groups.

836
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:19,965
- What if they moved?
- No.

837
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,768
No, no, no, no.
It would follow them.

838
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:29,608
What I would like to see
with Emily

839
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,978
is that I do think that
she needs to see, like,

840
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,147
a psychotherapist.

841
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:38,617
They're amazing
with treating PTSD,

842
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,586
which I think she does have.

843
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:43,455
So if Emily does
what you told them to do,

844
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,292
she should be pretty much
back to her old self?

845
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,794
Yeah.

846
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,429
You got good news.

847
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:53,832
Well, it's comforting
to know that, you know,

848
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,869
at some point in time,
she could be back to herself

849
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,204
and just have
a normal teenage life.

850
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,440
That's all we'd want.

851
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,776
So, Sal, are you gonna take
Amy's advice?

852
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:05,210
Yes. Definitely.

853
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,347
I appreciate her help.

854
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,050
The things that we are
able to control,

855
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:15,187
we're definitely gonna -- we're
gonna do what Amy is suggesting.

856
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:19,692
I think your family, as a whole,
pretty strong and tight,

857
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:22,461
so if anybody
can pull it off,

858
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,862
it's probably you guys.

859
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,097
Yeah, definitely.

860
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,666
This is, you know,
what we needed,

861
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:29,802
somewhere to get started.

862
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,136
Even though there is little

863
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:33,272
this family can do about
the aliens,

864
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:34,773
they should be able
to break the curse

865
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,408
with a<i> curandero</i>

866
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,211
and move the angry dead guy on
with a medium.

867
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:42,348
Once that's done, Emily can
get the help she needs,

868
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,949
and this family
can find the peace

869
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:45,818
they've been searching for.
