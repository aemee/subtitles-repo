1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,911
Something doesn't want us here.

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:17,483
I feel like I'm being
strangled by human hands.

3
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,618
Somebody grabbed me.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,088
You shouldn't have had
a park here for children.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,190
Why would anybody build
an amusement park

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,027
out in the middle
of nowhere?

7
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,895
People are being
brutally murdered.

8
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,164
We found these children
dead, scalped.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,533
I don't feel safe here.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,103
I just hear death,
too much death.

11
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,272
This is not a good situation.

12
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,474
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,742
There's death here.

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,544
Don't want to
go down there.

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,045
I see dead people.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,081
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,783
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,553
She's definitely
a serial killer.

19
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,321
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,824
She's going
to torture them.

21
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,327
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

22
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,363
They were all murdered.

23
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,064
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,499
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,434
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,136
So, is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

27
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,974
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,709
There's no question
in my mind

29
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,611
that he was talking
about Satan.

30
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,713
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,248
Who do you think
possessed you?

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,016
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,018
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,353
...until the very end...

35
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,955
Well, you're not gonna
want to see this.

36
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,324
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,792
Hell no!

38
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,326
...or time to get out.

39
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,429
Everyone is in jeopardy.

40
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,611
I'm in Lake Shawnee,
West Virginia.

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,546
It's about 90 miles
south of Charleston.

42
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,615
I got a call from a guy
named Chris.

43
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,284
Now, he owns an abandoned
amusement park,

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,687
and it's been
in his family for years.

45
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,288
Now, here is the problem.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,657
The activity is bad,
and it's getting worse.

47
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,158
Chris thinks it's just
a matter of time

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,493
before someone gets hurt.

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,762
Hopefully,
we can help this guy out.

50
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,035
I'm going to start
with the easy part,

51
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,938
removing any information
in the house,

52
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,908
but this is a huge property
with an abandoned theme park,

53
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,644
so I need to cover
any signs or memorials,

54
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,114
which could influence
Amy's findings.

55
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,718
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

56
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:52,271
There's something bad here
in the ground.

57
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,306
It's, like, not good.

58
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,941
It's not pure.

59
00:02:55,943 --> 00:03:00,946
It puts off a vibe,
a bad, bad vibe.

60
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,689
Now, Chris, when we spoke
on the phone,

61
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,725
you had a real sound
of concern in your voice.

62
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,160
What's going on?

63
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,897
My mother lives on my property.
Activity is picking up.

64
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,699
I just want to make sure
that my family

65
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,968
and also the volunteers
and the tourists

66
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,703
that come here
to visit the property,

67
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,638
I want to make sure
everybody is just safe.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,206
So, Chris, you got to
help me out here.

69
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,641
I notice it was
an amusement park,

70
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,175
but I see a rusted out
Ferris Wheel.

71
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,511
What do you do
with this place?

72
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:37,316
So we give a history tour,
and we do ghost-hunting tours.

73
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,450
Listen, I don't know how
Amy is going to feel about that,

74
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,719
but just be ready.

75
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,722
She may ask you to cut
the ghost-hunting stuff out.

76
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,123
Do me a favor.

77
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,291
Give me a list of what's
going on as far as activity.

78
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,662
Guests or volunteers,
they're hearing voices,

79
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,632
seeing
full-body apparitions.

80
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,335
They are being
pushed and shoved.

81
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,136
Chris, you mentioned
on the phone that this place

82
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,538
has been
in your family a while.

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,607
My father had bought
this property in 1985.

84
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,545
His dream was to restore it
back to an amusement park.

85
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,381
So now, Chris, your father,
is he still around?

86
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,083
No, he passed away
in 2010.

87
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,685
He died from cancer,
but this is a picture of him.

88
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,089
Now, did your father die
on the property?

89
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,092
No, he lived here for
the last 10 years of his life,

90
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,627
but he died
in a hospital.

91
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,028
Okay,
so besides your mother,

92
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,930
any other family
members live here?

93
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,866
My brother lived
on the property,

94
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,500
but he died
from a heart attack.

95
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,036
How old was he?

96
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,771
He was 51.

97
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,772
And this is
a picture of him?

98
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,440
Picture of my brother.

99
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,542
I got to ask the question,
you don't think anything

100
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,444
with the paranormal
activity had anything to do

101
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,213
with any of the deaths here,
do you?

102
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,748
I really can't tell.
That's why I called you guys.

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,183
Okay.

104
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,151
Why don't you
just cut your losses

105
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,518
and just sell
this property?

106
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,587
I'm sure you can do
pretty well by selling it.

107
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,623
Because it's too important
to my father,

108
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,659
and it's too important
to the community.

109
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,994
All right,
so this was your dad's dream,

110
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,462
to restore this
to an amusement park.

111
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,597
I mean, what about you?
Do you want to do that?

112
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,634
We pretty much let the land
do what it wants.

113
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,070
Okay.
If the land wants to create
back into an amusement park,

114
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,204
we'll let it happen,

115
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,673
but if it doesn't,
we just follow the land.

116
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,908
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

117
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,276
but it's your place.

118
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,078
It's your property.
All right.

119
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,780
So what do you think
is causing the activity here?

120
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,148
I feel that my father
and my brother is here.

121
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,683
I mean, you don't think
your father and your brother

122
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,786
are causing any of the pushing
and shoving that's going on?

123
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,888
Absolutely not.

124
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,956
I think there's
other activity here.

125
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,424
Okay.

126
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,231
I'm trying to focus,
and it's hard because

127
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,633
there's probably at least

128
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:42,473
12 conscious entities
around here.

129
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:47,212
I don't feel safe here because
something doesn't want us here.

130
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,118
Obviously, there were
Native Americans here

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,919
because they're saying that,

132
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,189
"This is, like, spiritual,"
you know,

133
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,124
"A sacred place for us.
Don't take it."

134
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,725
And we did anyways.

135
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,203
And so, Chris, this is
where your mom lives?

136
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,806
Yes, she lives on
the property by herself.

137
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,174
I mean, this is in
the middle of nowhere.

138
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,475
I mean, you got to be
worried about her

139
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,543
even though you live close.

140
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,979
Yeah, she'll call me
late at night,

141
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,215
and I just come down to check
on her, make sure she's safe.

142
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,250
So now, we talked
a lot about your guests,

143
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,919
your volunteers
having experiences.

144
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,554
What about you?
Have you had any?

145
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,088
Yeah.

146
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,957
Sometimes, whenever I'm in the
park doing a little bit of work,

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll catch images
out of the side of my eye,

148
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,061
just like shadows.

149
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,096
So what makes you think
it's not an actual shadow

150
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,899
from somebody
or something?

151
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,368
It's a big lot.
Nobody is allowed on it.

152
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,903
Okay, anything else?

153
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,838
One time, there was
a paranormal investigator.

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
He came to the park,
and he stepped inside

155
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,575
of one of the ticket booths
we had here.

156
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,143
- Okay.
- And whenever he stepped inside,

157
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,913
he'd come flying
backwards out of it,

158
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,714
and it looked like something
had shoved him out.

159
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,117
Listen, I run into
a lot of these people,

160
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,052
and they tend to exaggerate
a lot of things.

161
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,854
The way he flew out
of that ticket booth,

162
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,990
I don't think he could
have done it by himself.

163
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,457
Okay, so it looked
legit to you.

164
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,793
To me, it did.

165
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,394
Okay, so you've seen somebody
get physically attacked.

166
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,729
Anything like that
ever happen to you?

167
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,965
Yeah, whenever I was over
at the swing or the Ferris Wheel

168
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,800
and mowing grass,
I could feel a pressure

169
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,170
on my shoulders
and around my back.

170
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,138
Now, does this happen every time
you're out there working?

171
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,641
It's happened several times
but not every time.

172
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,243
So it sounds like you've had
some pretty scary experiences.

173
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,545
Now, is being here
really worth the trouble?

174
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,081
Well, my father had experiences
while he was here,

175
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,415
and he wanted to protect
the place

176
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,084
for the living
and the deceased.

177
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,452
- Okay.
- I'm the same way.

178
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,155
I want to protect the place
to keep it safe for both.

179
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,696
I'm feeling, like,
sick and nervous.

180
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:49,968
I feel like I'm being
strangled by human hands.

181
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,369
It's the Native Americans.

182
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,872
They really don't want me
to keep going.

183
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,774
I'm seeing, like, blood.

184
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,042
Where are you seeing
the blood?

185
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,046
It's, like, dripping.
It's on all of the chains.

186
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,617
The Native Americans caused
something bad to happen.

187
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,394
So, Jewell, I was talking
to your son, Chris,

188
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,464
and he thinks you may not
be safe with all this activity.

189
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,732
Do you agree with that?

190
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,199
- No.
- You don't?

191
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,570
Chris wants me to go live
with him, but I won't do it.

192
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,339
All right,
so have you had any experiences?

193
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,607
Personally, yes.

194
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,943
Okay, so can you tell me
about some of them?

195
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,012
There's things
always moving.

196
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:39,784
Sometimes, it's a pencil, keys,
just papers, sometimes.

197
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,085
I misplace stuff
all the time.

198
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,421
I mean, are you sure
it's nothing like that?

199
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,424
No, there is things
that I misplace, too.

200
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,725
Okay.

201
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,162
But these things will be things
that I just put in a place,

202
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,500
and then I walk out and walk
back in, and they're gone.

203
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,968
Okay, so anything else?

204
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,236
Yes.

205
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,105
I've seen an apparition
of an Indian warrior.

206
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,641
Why do you say it's a warrior?
How do you know that?

207
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,676
Because of the way
he's dressed.

208
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:09,481
He has no shirt, and he had some
type of instrument in his hand.

209
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,050
Okay, so it appeared
like he was ready for battle.

210
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,051
Right.

211
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,653
Kind of brushed
the side of my face.

212
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,855
I think, if I walked in,

213
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,989
and there was an Indian
warrior holding a weapon,

214
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,159
I think I'd be
a little uneasy about it.

215
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,494
Maybe, you would be.

216
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,729
- But you weren't.
- No.

217
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:35,473
I feel like maybe
they've experienced stuff

218
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:39,678
from the Native Americans.

219
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,948
I'm feeling like
someone who's alive,

220
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,220
they're panicking
about things being moved...

221
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,156
and I do feel like there
would be depression here.

222
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,561
I want to extend
my condolences.

223
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,431
I understand you lost
your husband and your son

224
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,633
while they were
living here.
Yes.

225
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,501
When you guys were
all living together,

226
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,969
did they have experiences?

227
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,238
Yes, they both did.

228
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,574
Jewell, your husband's passion
was turning this place

229
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,977
into another amusement park
and making it work.

230
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,912
But when that didn't happen,
how did he take it?

231
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,781
I think he thought
we were failures,

232
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,117
that we couldn't get
the business going,

233
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,752
that we couldn't get
anything working for us.

234
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,521
Do you think that had
something to do with,

235
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,856
maybe, whatever is here
doesn't want

236
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,524
another amusement
park built.

237
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,959
Yes.

238
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,798
I think that whatever is here
wanted to be the attraction.

239
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,334
I don't think
it wanted anything else.

240
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:40,671
I understand your son's death
was pretty sudden.

241
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,740
Chris told me
he suffered a heart attack.

242
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,908
He was a young man.

243
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,443
He was about 51?

244
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,778
Yeah.

245
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,013
Do you think the paranormal
had anything to do

246
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,880
with your
other son's death?

247
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,582
Never thought about that.

248
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,321
There was a living person
associated with the property,

249
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,157
as having heart issues.

250
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,826
Someone has had
a heart attack, male.

251
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:09,500
It's a result of being
exposed to the energy.

252
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,803
I believe it stems
from the Native Americans

253
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,771
who don't want anybody there.

254
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:18,009
I just hear death,
too much death.

255
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,585
So, Christian, I was talking
to your dad today.

256
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:44,786
I understand
you might have had

257
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,320
some scary stuff
happen to you here.

258
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,522
- Yes.
- All right.

259
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:48,856
Can you tell me
about one of them?

260
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,792
When I walk around here,

261
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,528
sometimes I feel like there's
people walking behind me.

262
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,330
All over the place
or in certain spots?

263
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,865
It's at random times
in certain spots.

264
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,200
Do you hear
anything behind you?

265
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:03,537
I feel like I hear footsteps
and people walking in the grass.

266
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:04,739
Okay.

267
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:05,874
Anything else happen?

268
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:09,010
When I was down over
at the swings,

269
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,579
and I felt like
somebody grabbed me

270
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,815
and held my arms
to my body.

271
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,583
Okay, you mean, like, somebody
grabbed both of your...

272
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,717
Like that?

273
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,285
Yes.

274
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,887
So when you got grabbed,
do you think

275
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,422
it was somebody trying
to tell you something?

276
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,425
Yes, like there's a bad spirit
maybe in front of me,

277
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:28,095
so they were trying to stop me
and make me turn around.

278
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,432
Now, would you ever stay here
by yourself overnight?

279
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,733
No, not really.

280
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:34,101
Okay, what about staying
at grandma's home?

281
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,336
- No.
- No?

282
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,172
Okay.

283
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,576
This is weird.

284
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,580
There's something trying
to protect the living here.

285
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:50,785
It's not human,
and it was very, very large,

286
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,854
at least eight feet tall.

287
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,292
It was behind us on the road.

288
00:12:57,294 --> 00:13:00,795
It had, like, robes on.

289
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:04,999
You know what's weird is that
that thing that's here

290
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:11,339
with the robes is not
Native American, but it's old.

291
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:18,479
He's more trying to
keep people away

292
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,682
because bad things
happen to people,

293
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:27,155
so I don't think he's
exactly bad, but he scares me.

294
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,097
After meeting with Chris
and his family,

295
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:39,233
I started talking to people
who had spent time at the park.

296
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,168
I never feel alone.

297
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,371
It always feels like
there's somebody around me,

298
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,907
with me, that feeling
of being watched.

299
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,276
It is definitely
an uneasy feeling for me.

300
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,377
And each one of them
has some damn good reasons

301
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,713
to be terrified.

302
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,683
I saw an apparition of a man
walking right here on the road,

303
00:13:55,685 --> 00:14:00,321
and he take four to five steps,
and he vanished into nowhere.

304
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:02,022
But one thing
they all had in common,

305
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,692
they were seeing shadows,
lots of them.

306
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:07,328
There was a time where
I've seen a shadow figure.

307
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,730
It was like
a figure of a man.

308
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:11,366
There was this overwhelming
sense of anxiety,

309
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,034
and I just felt like
I had to get out of there.

310
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,908
I'm trying to focus.

311
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,345
There is this other thing,
a child,

312
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:28,383
a male between
8 and 9 years of age.

313
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:32,219
He has taken it upon himself
to be, like,

314
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:34,221
a guard or something,

315
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:37,392
and he's, like,
watching all the time.

316
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:39,627
I think that people would
absolutely mistake him for,

317
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:44,766
like, a shadow person because
he's completely solid black.

318
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,567
Like, he feels like
it's stronger

319
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,904
than just looking like a person.

320
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:52,807
They shouldn't have had
a park here for children.

321
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,778
I don't like it.
It makes me uncomfortable.

322
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,716
Like, I'm scared,
feel like I'm being watched.

323
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,785
There's a bad person here.

324
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:06,054
I know it's a male.

325
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:09,157
This person is crazy
and isn't thinking straight,

326
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,826
anger, lots of anger.

327
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,795
Like, I want to throw up.

328
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:17,665
It's almost like
he blanks out from the rage.

329
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,033
I don't like this.

330
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,931
All right, I'm going to start
my investigation

331
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,566
with the obvious question,

332
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,636
who the hell built an amusement
park in the middle of nowhere,

333
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,805
and why did it shut down?

334
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,306
I'm heading back
to the property to meet

335
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,575
with a local historian
who says it's a story

336
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,644
I'm definitely going to
want to know about.

337
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,318
Pat, I want to thank you for
helping me out with this case.

338
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,621
So why would anybody build
an amusement park

339
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,289
out in the middle of nowhere?

340
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,758
It is the intersection
of two main roads

341
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,694
where there are
a lot of people coal mining

342
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,463
that had nothing to do.

343
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,930
Who opened this place?

344
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,833
A man named Conley Snidow,

345
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,103
and here's what it looked
like in its heyday.

346
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,771
He opened it in 1926.

347
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,307
The biggest attraction
was the swimming pool.

348
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,043
Over here
was a fishing hole.

349
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,644
There was paddle boating.

350
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,148
There were canoe rides, and then
right here, where we were,

351
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,586
was the bath house,
which had Saturday-night dances.

352
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,287
- Are you from this area?
- I am.

353
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,557
I came here a lot
when I was small.

354
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,292
You mentioned on the phone
there was some information

355
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,226
I was going to
want to know about.

356
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,327
What did you mean
by that?

357
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,962
There were three deaths
that were connected

358
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,831
with Lake Shawnee.
- All right.

359
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,232
So let's go through
these deaths one by one.

360
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,633
What was the first one?

361
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:46,804
In 1927, Conley Snidow's
3- year-old daughter, Eloise,

362
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,674
was killed at the hotel
where they lived.

363
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,044
One day, she ran for
the elevator to get on it.

364
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,546
She grabbed for the floor
of the elevator,

365
00:16:55,548 --> 00:17:00,218
and it pulled her up and crushed
her between that and the doors.

366
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,485
That's a pretty
sad death.

367
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,653
What about
the second one?

368
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,321
Second death
actually happened here

369
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,657
at Lake Shawnee
in the swimming pool.

370
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,526
It was a 6-year-old child
named Wayne Harman.

371
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,695
That happened in 1961.

372
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,399
Evidently, he jumped in,
and no one paid attention,

373
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,001
and someone brushed up
against his body

374
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,068
at the bottom
of the pool,

375
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,570
and they came up
and yelled to the lifeguard,

376
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,273
and they pulled him out,
but it was too late.

377
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,708
What about
the third one?

378
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,010
The third one happened
July 3, 1966,

379
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,079
right in the pool here,

380
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,882
John Richard Tolley,
who was 11 years old.

381
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,751
Here's an article
about it,

382
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,087
and he was stuck in the drain
at the bottom of the pool.

383
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,488
What a shame.

384
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,022
So in the matter
of five years,

385
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,691
he has two drownings
in the same pool.

386
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,960
That was the straw that broke
the camel's back

387
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,662
for Mr. Conley Snidow.

388
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,831
He closed it down,
never reopened it.

389
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,633
Anybody who can relate to
what those parents went through,

390
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,034
it was him.
- Absolutely.

391
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,637
It must have weighed very
heavily on his conscious for him

392
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,840
to close down a park
that was making money for him.
Right.

393
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:56,974
So, Pat,
I wouldn't normally ask

394
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,176
a person like you
this question,

395
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,511
but you told me you
came here as a kid.

396
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,180
Now, was there anything that
happened that you can't explain?

397
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,314
Yes.

398
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,450
I was swimming right here
as a 5-year-old,

399
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,720
and something grabbed me
by the bottom of my leg

400
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,458
and pulled me under,
and I went down into a hole.

401
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,661
My father had to pull me up
by the hair on my head.

402
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,396
Any thoughts about what might
have happened to you here or...

403
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,998
Something grabbed me.

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,132
It felt like a hand.

405
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,634
When I heard about
those children,

406
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,136
the first thing that
came into my head was,

407
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,539
"What grabbed them
and pulled them under?"

408
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,279
The water repels me.

409
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,548
There's been losses.

410
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,352
I'm feeling tragedies
associated with this.

411
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,756
I think that people died there
when it was a park.

412
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,963
I'm seeing two, so I don't know
if two people got hurt

413
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,697
or they died.

414
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,700
- How recent?
- '70s?

415
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,435
maybe it is '60s.

416
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,838
Native Americans caused
accidents to happen.

417
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,174
It's just horrible.

418
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,277
So I'm walking over
to meet a genealogist

419
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,112
who was doing some research
on this place for me,

420
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,447
and he came up
with something big.

421
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,583
Turns out, the original
owners of this land

422
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,986
got ambushed
by local Native Americans,

423
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,587
and it was a bloodbath.

424
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,660
Well, Dan, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.

425
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,395
You said on the phone
there was a pretty brutal

426
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,130
Indian attack
on this land.

427
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,164
That's correct.

428
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,266
Okay, so before we even
get to that,

429
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,934
what do you know
about the original owners?

430
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,737
The original owner was a man
by the name of Mitchell Clay.

431
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,938
He was from
Eastern Virginia.

432
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,408
He was a wealthy
tobacco planter, a slave owner,

433
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,144
and in 1775,
Mitchell Clay, his wife, Phoebe,

434
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,147
and their 14 children
moved onto the land,

435
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,415
and this would have
been the cabin

436
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,217
that they built
and lived in.

437
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,718
Okay,
so they settled here.

438
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,953
What about
local Indian tribes?

439
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,288
There were no permanent
local Indian settlements here.

440
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,624
However, the Shawnee Indians
would pass through here

441
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,825
periodically to hunt.

442
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,428
Did Indians ever inhabit
this land at some point?

443
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,096
In the 1400s,
there were certainly

444
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,298
Indian settlements here.

445
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,366
In fact, the current landowner,
back in the late '80s,

446
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,036
accidentally excavated
a grave site

447
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,738
just on this corner
of the property over here,

448
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,642
21 sets of remains,
and 13 were children,

449
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,245
and it's possible that there
are many more remains here.

450
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,579
Okay, so let's get
to the attack.

451
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,713
What happened?

452
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,316
In the fall of 1783,
Mitchell Clay

453
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,783
and his two oldest sons
had gone hunting.

454
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,852
They'd left two of the boys,
Ezekiel and Bartley,

455
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,654
to build a fence around
some of their fields.

456
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,257
Shawnee Indians fired a shot
and killed Bartley on the spot,

457
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,459
only 17 years old.

458
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,761
Bartley's sister, Tabitha,
rushed to his aid.

459
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,129
She wound up being
stabbed repeatedly,

460
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,731
and she died
on this very spot.

461
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,601
Once Bartley and Tabitha
were dead,

462
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,270
the Indians scalped
both of them and then grabbed

463
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,273
and kidnapped their 16-year-old
brother, Ezekiel.

464
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,543
Short time later,
Mitchell Clay returned

465
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,077
with his oldest sons.

466
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,914
He found his children dead
and scalped.

467
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,748
What does he do?

468
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,018
He then gathers a posse,

469
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,022
and they pursue the Indians
who had taken Ezekiel

470
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,157
about 150 miles
into Ohio.

471
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,725
Does he find them?

472
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,761
He finds them,
but he finds them too late.

473
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,096
By the time
he catches up with them,

474
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,632
they have tortured
young Ezekiel

475
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,233
and burned him
at the stake.

476
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,467
All right.

477
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,303
Mitchell Clay,
three dead kids.

478
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,104
- Yes, sir.
- And he comes home?

479
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,239
No.

480
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,775
He sells the farm,
and then they move

481
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,644
many miles away
back into Virginia,

482
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,380
and he lives there the rest
of his life with his wife,

483
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:26,016
and they die there.

484
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,385
There's a bunch
of happy people.

485
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,854
They were all white.

486
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,022
It's all good vibes.

487
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,392
You know, people
are singing and dancing.

488
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:40,064
There's, like, a covered-wagon
thing, I think 1760s.

489
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,066
Then, the Native Americans
got really mad,

490
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,702
and then it kind of
went a little nuts.

491
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,872
And I'm hearing
screaming and yelling

492
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,441
and people running around.

493
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,942
They were caught off guard.

494
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,878
People are being
brutally murdered.

495
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,649
Then I'm with this mother,
and I think I want to die,

496
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,085
want to kill myself.

497
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,353
It's survivor's guilt.

498
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,622
There's a lot of pain here.

499
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,892
These souls are not at rest.

500

and we'll help if we can.

506
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,286
So far, I've got a client
who fears

507
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,621
for the safety of his mother,

508
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,690
volunteers, and guests

509
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,992
on a property
where two kids drowned,

510
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,360
two other kids were murdered,

511
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,863
and where Native American
remains were found,

512
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,432
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

513
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,767
Searching through old records,

514
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,635
I found an article
about a brutal murder

515
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,705
that took place in 1935.

516
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,109
Turns out, it happened
right along Chris' property.

517
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,477
So I called the local cops,

518
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,412
and they don't want to
talk to me about this case,

519
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,614
but my old friend
Matt McGrew does.

520
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,182
I'm heading over
to meet with him now,

521
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:08,218
and he says this murder turned
out to be a crime of passion.

522
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,458
So, Matt,
it's good to see you again.

523
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,260
I appreciate you helping out
with this case.

524
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,529
Now, what do you know
about this perp?

525
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,965
Well, his name is
James Craft Belcher.

526
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,567
He's a local guy,
25 years old.

527
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,802
Belcher,
the name sounds familiar.

528
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,604
I think it came up
in my title search.

529
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,939
His grandparents actually
owned the property

530
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,274
in the early 1900s.

531
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,042
So there's
a good possibility

532
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,144
the perp spent time
on my client's property.

533
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,547
Definitely, and he would
have grown up there.

534
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,849
All right, so what do we know
about the victim?

535
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:45,389
He actually was seeing
a woman named Myrtle Taylor.

536
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,424
She's 19 years old.
She's a local girl.

537
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,026
They've grown up
in the same area.

538
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,095
All right, so now, take me
to the night of the murder.

539
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,631
On the night
of May 11, 1935,

540
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,432
Belcher goes into
a restaurant and sees

541
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,868
Myrtle eating dinner
with another man,

542
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,937
so as you might imagine,
they start fighting about it.

543
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,304
Okay.

544
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,505
And she doesn't
want to leave.

545
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,041
You know,
she can tell he's upset,

546
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,577
but he forces her
to leave with him

547
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:10,914
and forces her
into the car.

548
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,719
I don't feel good, and I am
getting, like, a pain, like,

549
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:19,189
here and here,
really bad, actually.

550
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,392
I think somebody got hit there.

551
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:25,195
I think it's a woman.

552
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:29,532
I think between
14 and 16 years of age,

553
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:35,138
she seemed to be from
a long time ago, like the '40s.

554
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,774
I feel like
there's a bad person here.

555
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,945
I don't know who this person is.

556
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:46,116
I know it's a male,
and she knows him.

557
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,551
Do you know
what happened?

558
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:52,056
I know that his intentions
were not good.

559
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,558
Okay, so this guy basically
kidnapped his own girlfriend.

560
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,626
So what happened?

561
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,561
Somewhere along
Rock-Shawnee Road,

562
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,830
which is right along
your client's property,

563
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,899
they stop the car,
and they get out.

564
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:05,302
He pulls out a gun, and he
shoots her in the head twice.

565
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,505
I'm assuming she gets killed
right there and then.

566
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,140
No, he puts her back
into the car.

567
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,477
She's still alive, and
he drives her to the hospital,

568
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,914
but obviously, she's basically
in a coma at this point.

569
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,581
She dies
a few hours later.

570
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,050
Does he confess to it?

571
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:24,721
He goes to trial, and he
actually makes an insanity plea.

572
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,023
The jury doesn't buy it.

573
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,391
They convict him.
- All right.

574
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,125
So did this guy ever get parole,
or did he die in prison?

575
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,930
No, he dies in prison in 1993
when he was 85.

576
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,298
I've seen this
a thousand times.

577
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
I mean, it's a crime of passion,
a lot of rage here.

578
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:37,901
That's right.

579
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,803
It's a shame
he never hung, though.

580
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:46,176
That guy that she knew
was attacking her.

581
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,677
God, it hurts.

582
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,083
There was blood in her mouth,
and the pain was horrible,

583
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:57,788
and she was, like, basically
going into shock at that time.

584
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,892
This female, I believe,
was abducted or murdered

585
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,327
by this man.

586
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,630
The sun is, like,
just starting to go down

587
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,865
when all of this happened,

588
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,601
and there's, like,
a lot of adrenaline and anger,

589
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,107
Rage, just blind rage.

590
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,651
During my walk, I saw several
disturbing things,

591
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,256
but the teenage girl who
was murdered really stood out.

592
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,191
She was younger.

593
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:38,128
I'd place her between
14 and 16 years of age.

594
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,265
Her eyes were more
rounded in shape.

595
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,871
Her hair was brown
or dark blonde.

596
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,382
Amy,
is this what you saw?

597
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,017
Yes.

598
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:22,322
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

599
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,391
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

600
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:28,062
and our clients
for the first time.

601
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,529
Well, Amy,
let's start with the obvious.

602
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:30,998
I mean, I'm sure
you figured out by now

603
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,933
that this used to be
an amusement park.

604
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:35,001
Chris owns it here
with his mom, Jewell,

605
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,003
who lives
on the property alone.

606
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,672
We'll get into the reasons
why this place means

607
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:41,542
so much to them later,
but for now, Chris called us in

608
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:43,510
because he's not sure
if it's safe for his mom

609
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:44,878
to be here alone

610
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,747
or for anybody else
that comes onto the property.

611
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,349
Now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

612
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,085
I'll ask her to describe
her walk with us.

613
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,622
This walk was really
overwhelming

614
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:57,324
because I encountered

615
00:27:57,326 --> 00:28:01,761
at least 12 conscious
entities that are here.

616
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,465
It would take all night
to go into each one of them,

617
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,501
so I'm just going
to focus on the ones

618
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,771
specifically who can directly
influence the living.

619
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,440
The first individual
I encountered, actually,

620
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:17,211
a little boy,
I would say he was about 8 or 9,

621
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:19,846
and what he's doing is
he's taken it upon himself

622
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:23,050
to kind of, like,
be a guard here

623
00:28:23,052 --> 00:28:26,253
and watch everybody's
coming and going.

624
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:29,088
Obviously, I think you would
feel watched by him.

625
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,660
You might be able to see him,
like a blocky shadow person.

626
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,429
Everybody I spoke to
and interviewed

627
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:38,332
had the experience of feeling
watched or seeing shadows.

628
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,133
Now, you told me you saw
shadows, right, Chris?

629
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,301
Yes, out of the side
of my eye,

630
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,570
I would catch a shadow
every once in a while.

631
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:44,938
So, Chris, do me a favor.

632
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,341
Tell Amy how your son feels
like he's being followed.

633
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,608
Yeah, whenever he goes
around the park,

634
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,410
he feels like somebody
is following him,

635
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,745
and then whenever he stops,

636
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:54,147
he hears two more
steps behind him.

637
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,716
Interesting.

638
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:58,752
There was another dead
male here who was an adult.

639
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:01,488
What I got mainly off of him
was a lot of adrenaline,

640
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,892
a lot of anger,
and a lot of rage.

641
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:08,728
If a living person was exposed
to that energy consistently,

642
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:14,034
they could feel intense anxiety
like they're being stalked.

643
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,969
I interviewed a guy named Bob
who does volunteer work

644
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,404
for you on the property.

645
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:20,440
Now, he told me he got hit
with some serious anxiety

646
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,742
by the old school bus
that's right over here,

647
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:25,245
but it was so bad that he had
to run off the property.

648
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,380
Wow.

649
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:31,652
Next, I ran into a very old
and very strange thing.

650
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:35,923
It's, like, 8 feet tall,
and it has all these robes on.

651
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,124
I was really uncomfortable
at first.

652
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,594
So he's actually someone
who's trying to warn

653
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:43,930
and protect, which I found
freaking fascinating.

654
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,698
Well, let me ask you
a question because

655
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,766
when I spoke to your son,

656
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,268
he told me he felt
like he got grabbed.

657
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,072
Now, he told me he felt like it
was somebody protecting him

658
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,608
to stop from going
into a bad area.

659
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,343
Could be.

660
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:58,779
You told me you get touched
while you're on your tractor.

661
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,480
Yeah, I feel a little bit
of pressure

662
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:01,748
on my shoulders
and stuff,

663
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,083
like something
is behind me.

664
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,485
Now, who do you think that could
be, touching his shoulders?

665
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,387
There's a lot of people.

666
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,689
Possibly, your dad.

667
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:13,026
Could be.

668
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,562
One thing that I got
throughout my walk

669
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,965
was the overwhelming feeling
of sadness and despair

670
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:22,636
because of the deaths
over the years,

671
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:27,040
and I got that people
did die when it was a park.

672
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,776
I got that two deaths
specifically, I thought,

673
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,611
happened in the '60s.

674
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:36,116
Frankly, I was like,
"Who would build this here?"

675
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,851
Like, the energy is not good.

676
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:41,321
It's funny because when
I showed up here, I was like,

677
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,457
"Who the hell would build this
place in the middle of nowhere?"

678
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:46,026
When this was an amusement park,
it was called Lake Shawnee,

679
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:50,130
and it was built by a guy named
Conley Snidow back in 1926.

680
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,699
I got a photo here
of what it looked like

681
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:56,603
when it was pretty much in
its heyday as an amusement park.

682
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,839
Now, you said you got a couple
of deaths in the '60s.

683
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:01,541
Well, get this,
back in June of 1961,

684
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:03,643
a 6-year-old boy
named Wayne Harman

685
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:06,847
drowned in that pond
right over here.

686
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,684
Here's an article on it.

687
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:13,687
Then, in July of 1966,
an 11-year-old boy

688
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:17,157
named John Richard Tolley
drowned in the same pond.

689
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,026
Now, the guilt was
so much for Snidow

690
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,893
that he ended up closing
this place for good

691
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,362
at the end of that summer.

692
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:25,465
Now, I almost never ask experts
if they've had experiences,

693
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,034
but the historian I spoke
to used to come here

694
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:30,437
when she was a kid
and swim in the pond

695
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:34,174
until one time she felt
like somebody grabbed her foot

696
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,443
inside the pond
and pulled her down.

697
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:37,777
Now, she almost drowned,

698
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,713
but she's totally
convinced to this day

699
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,314
that it was a paranormal event.

700
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,649
Interesting.

701
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,517
I think now is probably
a good time to tell Amy

702
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,120
why this property is
so important to the family.

703
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:48,655
It meant the world.

704
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,857
Now, Chris' father,
Jewell's husband,

705
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,192
bought the property in 1985.

706
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,995
His dream was to own it
and restore it,

707
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,633
but nothing worked right,
and so finally,

708
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:01,868
we just had to
kind of give up.

709
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,741
Now, would you mind telling Amy
about how your husband passed.

710
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,911
It ended up being
colon cancer.

711
00:32:10,913 --> 00:32:13,146
And when he passed,
he was still living here.

712
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,781
Right.

713
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:17,084
Chris, you're trying to preserve
your father's dream.

714
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,318
Yes.

715
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,388
I think our intention is
to preserve the property

716
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,622
just the way it is.

717
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:26,093
So I know that you guys have
paranormal investigators

718
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,562
and all of this
kind of thing.

719
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:31,564
We do.

720
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,566
Anything else?

721
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:36,436
I ran into
a deceased female,

722
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:39,873
and I would have put her
between 14 and 16 years of age.

723
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,108
She seemed to be
from a while ago.

724
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,911
There was a male
that she runs into,

725
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:48,448
and I think that
this male killed her.

726
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,184
Now, I think
you're describing the murder

727
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,986
I came across in my research.

728
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:55,521
Now, the killer was a local guy
named James Belcher

729
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:56,823
who was 25 years old.

730
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,625
His grandparents actually
owned this property

731
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,126
in the early 1900s.

732
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,095
Belcher was separated
from his wife

733
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,130
and had a mistress
by the name of Myrtle Taylor.

734
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:06,199
She was only 19 years old.

735
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,335
And on May 11, 1935,
Belcher walked into a restaurant

736
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,071
and sees her with
another guy, having dinner.

737
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,106
Well, he freaks out,
and he basically kidnaps her

738
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:14,740
and forces her into the car.

739
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,544
Now, what he does is pulls over
right on the road right here.

740
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,613
Belcher grabs a gun and shoots
her twice in the head.

741
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:21,013
Holy...

742
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:23,383
I actually have a photo
of both of them.

743
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,023
Is it possible
that's who you saw?

744
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:32,826
I had a sketch done
of the girl I saw.

745
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,669
I mean,
the nose, the eyes.

746
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,838
I mean, the photo is not great,
but it's very possible

747
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,573
that this is the same girl.

748
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,409
It looks<i> exactly</i> alike.

749
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,044
So, Mom, you think
it could be the same girl?

750
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,245
I do.

751
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:53,346
You can see it, yeah.

752
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:55,148
The mouth, to me.

753
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,055
Another thing that I saw
was very disturbing,

754
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:04,190
and it took place
a long time ago,

755
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:06,593
and it was near
a covered wagon.

756
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:09,162
Everybody is happy.
There's kids.

757
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:11,464
They built a bonfire,
singing and dancing,

758
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,133
having a good old time,

759
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,269
and then I'm hearing
screaming and yelling,

760
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:20,273
and I got that it was,
like, really awful murders,

761
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,043
and I think it was safe
to assume that Native Americans

762
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,011
had committed this attack

763
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:27,414
on what looked like
a white family.

764
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:29,883
I knew that these people
had been caught off guard.

765
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,419
They totally did not
expect this to happen.

766
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,088
There was a thing about
the Native Americans

767
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,357
being all pissed off because
they felt this was sacred land.

768
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,160
Do you have a time frame?

769
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:43,430
The 1750s or '60s.

770
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:44,797
Wow.

771
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,299
I think I know exactly
what you're talking about

772
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,767
and what you saw.

773
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,236
This property is the site
of the most brutal Indian attack

774
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:51,571
in the history of this area.

775
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:54,441
In 1774,
a guy name Mitchell Clay

776
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:56,843
bought over 800 acres
and moved onto the property here

777
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,912
with his wife, Phoebe,
and 14 kids.

778
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,647
Now, they were the first
white settlers

779
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:03,049
in this part of the country.

780
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:06,586
I got a picture of the house
they lived in, actually.

781
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:10,790
Now, in 1783, Clay went hunting
with his two oldest sons

782
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,125
and left everybody else home.

783
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,728
As soon as he left,
a group of Shawnee Indians

784
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,196
stormed the property.

785
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,365
First, they shot and killed
Clay's 17-year-old son, Bartley.

786
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,802
Then they slashed their teenage
daughter, Tabitha, to death.

787
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,070
Then they scalped
both these kids

788
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:26,606
and then kidnapped their
16-year-old brother, Ezekiel,

789
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:28,275
and took him to Ohio.

790
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:30,610
When Clay found out about this,
he rounded up a posse,

791
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,146
and he went to Ohio
to try and save his son,

792
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,415
but by the time he got there,
it was too late.

793
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,884
Ezekiel had been tortured
and burned at the stake.

794
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,053
Holy...

795
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,956
They mentioned the attack
was retaliation for the land.

796
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,325
The expert I spoke to told me
that the Shawnee Indians

797
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,894
didn't actually live here
when the attack happened,

798
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,431
but they did have a settlement
here way back in the 1400s.

799
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:55,368
In fact, back in 1989, Chris'
family was excavating land here,

800
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,638
and they uncovered human remains
that belonged to those Indians.

801
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,808
They found more than 20 bodies,
13 of which were kids.

802
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,376
Now, there's a good reason
to believe that

803
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,111
there were more bodies
still here.

804
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:09,950
I actually have a photo of one
of the remains they uncovered.

805
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,718
- Wow.
- Yeah.

806
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,020
It's hard to believe that
something like this happened

807
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:15,955
on this piece of land.

808
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,558
Maybe, it is an amusement park
for the dead.

809
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,529
So now, are these
Native Americans still here?

810
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,466
Yes.

811
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:28,735
They're upset and active.

812
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:32,572
They didn't want us here
doing the investigation.

813
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:35,475
Possibly, at times, they would
make the living here

814
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:38,745
feel intimidated and nervous.

815
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:42,882
Unfortunately, one of the things
that they were indicating

816
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:46,753
that they'd resorted to
is making the living sick here,

817
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:48,788
putting emotions
onto the living people,

818
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,824
trying to get the living
to hurt one another

819
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,027
and causing accidents,

820
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,730
and one of the things
that I got was

821
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,565
that a male associated
with the property

822
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:03,169
was having a heart attack
or heart issues.

823
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,637
I was hoping we wouldn't
have to talk about this,

824
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,439
but, Jewell, can you
tell Amy about your son?

825
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:10,643
He had 26 heart attacks
before he passed away

826
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,312
with a massive
heart attack.

827
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,447
And he was, like, 51?

828
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:15,915
And he lived on the property
at the time.

829
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,883
- Yes.
- Wow.

830
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,288
I actually have a photo of her
son that they provided me with.

831
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,689
Wow.

832
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,123
Okay.

833
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,925
I saw him during my walk.

834
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,397
Does it make you happy
or kind of sad?

835
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:33,033
Makes me --
I'm okay with it.

836
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:37,704
I think he's here protecting
and protecting my mother.

837
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:40,873
All right,
so what else?

838
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,942
Well, then, I went over
to the house.

839
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,511
And that's where
you live, Jewell.

840
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,779
Yes.

841
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,214
I got that the Native Americans
are very active there,

842
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:49,683
and because of that,

843
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:54,020
I think that there would
be experiences sometimes.

844
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,489
I got that they can show
themselves and interact

845
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,224
with their surroundings.

846
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:01,461
I did see something being
moved around in the house.

847
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:02,962
Tell Amy what goes on.

848
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,498
Sometimes, I'll lay something
down and go to another room,

849
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,034
and when I come back,
it's in a different place.

850
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,705
Sometimes, it's gone, and then
a couple days, it shows back up.

851
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,375
Now, you had told me
you saw an apparition

852
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,642
of a Native American warrior.

853
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:17,911
Yes.

854
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:21,981
He had no clothes, was
holding something in his hand.

855
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:24,317
The big question, I think,
is, what do these Indians

856
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:25,719
want from these guys?

857
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,654
So basically,
the Native Americans believe

858
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:30,123
that this is their land,

859
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:33,593
and they want it back, and
they don't want anybody here.

860
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:39,298
Their goal is
to get them off this land.

861
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,037
I do know that they did possibly
affect your son's health,

862
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:46,406
so that's troublesome.

863
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,342
I feel
that we need to maybe see

864
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,677
if there's some way
we can resolve this.

865
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,647
If it's moving her off the
property, that's what we'll do.

866
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:58,117
I don't feel it's me
that they want off the property.

867
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,138
So, Chris, I know that one thing
you're passionate about

868
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,341
is honoring your dad's memory
and keeping his dream alive,

869
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:25,945
and that means making this park
safe for volunteers, guests

870
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,480
and, most of all, your mom,

871
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,615
but to see what
that's going to take,

872
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,285
I'm going to turn
it over to Amy.

873
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,086
It's really hard
for me to say,

874
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:37,557
"Stop doing events
and investigations here,"

875
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,527
because I feel like
it should be investigated.

876
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:46,933
What I'm thinking is maybe
that you kind of really screen

877
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:48,901
who's coming here
and why

878
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:51,437
because you really
don't want antagonistic people

879
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,541
that are, like, you know,
"We're going to drink and party,

880
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:56,543
and we're going to,
like, hunt ghosts."

881
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,412
You know what I mean?

882
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,481
And I think that after
every event

883
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,216
and every investigation,

884
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:07,786
an offering needs to be left
because the Native Americans

885
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:10,657
do not feel respected
at this time.

886
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,525
So now, when they make
the offerings,

887
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:13,593
do they have to say anything?

888
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:15,361
Is there any kind of a ritual?

889
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:18,364
They'll be guided
as to what to bring.

890
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:23,636
Like, these Native Americans
are very hands-on, I guess,

891
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:26,706
guiding what they want
and how they want it.

892
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,374
You're nodding your head
yes like you know

893
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,409
what she's talking about.
Yes.

894
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,578
Do you know what
she's talking about?
I do.

895
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,881
Then, you guys are ahead
of the game, then.

896
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:36,149
What about these
physical attacks

897
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,717
that are happening
to people that come here?

898
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,419
Will that stop with
the offerings?

899
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:41,888
Yeah, the offerings
are going to help a lot.

900
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,756
Okay, so what else
do they need to do?

901
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,825
As far as the dead here,

902
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:51,831
I would like to see at least
the murdered girl moved on.

903
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,967
You just need to have
a medium come and call out

904
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,036
to her and move her on.

905
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,705
My question now is, are you
going to take Amy's advice

906
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,406
and do what
she's telling you?

907
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:02,008
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

908
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:07,246
And I know 100% that they
will be followed through with.

909
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:10,383
I think it's a big relief
that we know at least

910
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,652
we can keep
everybody safe.

911
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:14,454
Okay, how do you think
your father would have felt?

912
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:15,989
I think he's pleased.

913
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:18,191
I know he's happy.

914
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:19,592
I can feel him.

915
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:21,193
That takes a burden
off of him.

916
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:23,863
It takes a burden
off of us.

917
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:26,699
It just totally
relieves me.

918
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:30,169
I'm just so happy,
and I know he's happy.

919
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,939
Chris and Jewell have a lot
of work ahead of them,

920
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:35,808
but if they contact a medium
to remove the dead girl,

921
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,278
screen people
who want to visit the park

922
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,614
and make consistent offerings
to the Native Americans,

923
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:44,617
Chris will be able to keep
his dad's dream alive,

924
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,756
and maybe, one day, Lake Shawnee
will be back open for business.
