1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:13,145
This man is insane.

2
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,948
He's a predator.
He should have gone to hell.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,617
- It really freaked me out.
- I just want it gone.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,488
I see a war.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,689
What a horrible way to go.

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,091
You're my last hope.

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,960
He likes them young.

8
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,896
He needs to get the hell
out of my house.

9
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:34,333
They're absorbing
way too much dead energy.

10
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,869
This is not a good situation.

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,737
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,339
There's death here.

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,074
Don't wanna go down there.

14
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,342
I see dead people.

15
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,444
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

16
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:48,113
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,916
She's definitely
a serial killer.

18
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,718
...and they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,887
She's going to torture them.

20
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,690
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,826
They were all murdered.

22
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,327
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,896
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,697
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,400
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

26
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,970
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:16,041
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

28
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,743
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,378
Who do you think
possessed you?

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,547
But Steve and I
never speak...

31
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,582
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,817
...until the very end.

33
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,452
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

34
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,520
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

35
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,022
<i>Hell,</i> no.

36
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,690
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,692
Everyone is in jeopardy.

38
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,341
I'm in the small town
of Briceville, Tennessee.

39
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,910
It's about a half-hour north
of Knoxville.

40
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,213
I got a call from
a single mom named Leonora.

41
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,715
Now, this poor woman
scrimped and saved to buy

42
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,550
a dream house
for her three kids.

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,885
Now here's the problem --

44
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,887
they're all being pushed,
scratched,

45
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,789
and basically scared to death.

46
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,357
She says if we can't help,

47
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,493
someone is going to
wind up badly hurt.

48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,633
Before Amy arrives,

49
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,403
I clear the area
of any leading information.

50
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,340
This home has a lot
of photographs

51
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,609
and religious symbols,

52
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,913
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

53
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,916
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,295
Boy.

55
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,164
I'm just hearing, like,
"Don't come down here."

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,267
It's an older male.

57
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,104
He doesn't want living
or dead out here.

58
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,479
He's saying, "Mine. Mine.
Mine. Mine. It's all mine."

59
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,347
How would he affect
the living?

60
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,153
I think, with him, it would be
impressing upon them emotions

61
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,323
of fear and urgency to get out.

62
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:17,396
This man is completely,
utterly insane.

63
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,973
So, Leonora, you sounded
terrified on the phone.

64
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,908
What are you guys
going through?

65
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,944
I feel like something
is evil here.

66
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,279
It's attacking my family.

67
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,248
It's targeting my kids.

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,017
I don't know what to do
to protect them.

69
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,086
How long have you guys
been living here?

70
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,821
I've been here
a little over a year.

71
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,122
Do you know anything
about the history

72
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,557
of the house
or the property?

73
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,392
I was told by a neighbor

74
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,529
that the previous owners
had passed away.

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,431
- In the house?
- Yes.

76
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,166
That's something
I'll look into.

77
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,801
Who exactly
lives in the house?

78
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,070
I have a photo.

79
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,973
This is my 14-year-old son,
William.

80
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:05,043
This is me, my 20-year-old
daughter, Amber.

81
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,480
This is my 4-year-old son,
Easton.

82
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:13,151
I adopted him to make sure
he had a safe place to go,

83
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:17,089
and I do not feel like
he has a safe place here.

84
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,492
Easton is being targeted.

85
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,362
He sees things that
we can't explain.

86
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,998
It's getting
very physical with him.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,599
That's got to be hard
on you as a mom.

88
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,434
It's a little
heartbreaking for me.

89
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,802
Do me a favor.

90
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,405
Give me a list of what's
going on as far as activity.

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,340
We have everything.

92
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:40,145
There's been footsteps,
feeling watched, items moving,

93
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,647
shadow figures,

94
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,350
constant nausea,
and physical attacks.

95
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,551
I've got to ask you
a question.

96
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,753
Why don't you just
pick up and leave?

97
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,955
Moving is not an option.

98
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,891
I've poured every bit
of life savings in this home.

99
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,728
What are you hoping to get
out of this investigation?

100
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,066
My family to be safe and go back
to the way it used to be

101
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,069
before we were being
assaulted.

102
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,272
The kids are afraid,
so that breaks my heart.

103
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,875
What do you think is in
this house? What's it want?

104
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,244
I believe it wants to tear
our family apart,

105
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:15,514
and I believe that it wants us
out of the house.

106
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,920
There's something wrong.

107
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,723
The old dead guy,

108
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,026
he particularly
likes to bother children.

109
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,931
He does call them rug rats,

110
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,802
and he says they are like rats.

111
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,370
They're pests.

112
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:42,607
And he's very grumpy.
He's very angry.

113
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,943
He will get into...rages.

114
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:49,114
When he's in a...mood,
he stomps, like...

115
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,984
The whole house will shake.

116
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:57,389
The living, with him,
would definitely hear

117
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:01,493
stomping all throughout
the house.

118
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,834
Okay, Leonora, what's going on
in this hallway?

119
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,437
Footsteps coming up and down
the hallway almost nightly.

120
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,839
All right.

121
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:14,973
So when you hear these steps,
what's it sound like?

122
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,776
I would say it sounds
like a heavier man

123
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,711
stomping down the hallway.

124
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,646
You sure it's nobody that got up
in the middle of the night?

125
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:26,952
No, because I've got up and
checked, and nothing is there.

126
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,687
Okay. What else?

127
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,256
When I'm laying in
my bedroom at night,

128
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,892
I see a very tall
dark figure of a man

129
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,161
moving up
and down the hallway.

130
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,629
What makes you say
it's a man?

131
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,865
Just the way it's built.
It's really tall.

132
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,501
It's a lot taller
than anybody in the house.

133
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,035
So could it be somebody
on the outside

134
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,037
walking back and forth?
- No.

135
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,173
I keep the blinds shut
all the time.

136
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,608
All right. Anything else?

137
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,180
In the living room, a flashlight
flew off of the coffee table.

138
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,149
Gave me chills.

139
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,416
Couldn't it have just
rolled off?

140
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,020
It is completely square.
There's no way it can roll off.

141
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,589
The scary part is
if it could do that,

142
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,857
it could have
flung it at your head.

143
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,559
Who's to say they won't
pick it up and throw it

144
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,427
at Easton,
being so young?

145
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,530
You know, it could kill him.

146
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,203
This old man,
I'm trying to get out of him

147
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,639
all the...that he does
to the living.

148
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,908
Do they see him?

149
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,945
I think they do see him
when he's pitching a fit.

150
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,347
Why do you get mad?

151
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,383
I'm seeing him getting mad

152
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,419
and throwing things
around violently.

153
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,791
He's showing me plates flying.

154
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,961
He says,
"This is my spectacular."

155
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,564
He says, "That scares them."

156
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,532
He likes that.

157
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,001
It scares them.

158
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,509
So, Leonora, obviously,
this is your bedroom. Right.

159
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,778
And this is where your
youngest sleeps with you?
Yes.

160
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,013
Have you ever seen him
have an experience?

161
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,615
He's been
physically attacked.

162
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:07,152
I've seen him being shoved
really hard in the back.

163
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,454
- You sure he didn't trip?
- His neck and back,

164
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,123
it looked like somebody
had physically shoved him.

165
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,658
Did he tell you
who shoved him?

166
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,262
He just said,
"The big man."

167
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,397
Was that the only time
you've see him get attacked?

168
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,133
No. I have a photo.

169
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,803
He has woken up
with bruises.

170
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,738
It sounds like
he's getting the brunt

171
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,440
of a lot
of this physical stuff.

172
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,642
Now what about you?
What's going on with you?

173
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:34,012
I'm getting a feeling of being
very sick to my stomach

174
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,015
all of a sudden and the life
being sucked out of me.

175
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,150
I feel drained,
just nauseous.

176
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,086
Now, is that only in this
room you feel this way?

177
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,388
Mostly in here.
It just hits me.

178
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,990
It's pretty bad.

179
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,791
If you walk outside,
does it stop?

180
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,426
Yes. It does go away.

181
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,527
Have you been to the doctor?

182
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,429
- I go for normal checkups.
- Right.

183
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,533
They can't find anything
that would cause that.

184
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,868
Okay. Anything else?

185
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,938
My TV comes on by itself.

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,241
The TV will just
pop on or pop off.

187
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,743
Okay. Have you had
the electric checked?

188
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,911
I have.

189
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,545
You really got a lot
going on here.

190
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,748
You did a real incredible
thing saving this kid,

191
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,617
and then you sacrificed
everything to buy a home

192
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,219
so everybody could have
a good place to live,

193
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,421
and it backfired on you.

194
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,790
Nothing feels safe.

195
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,725
You're my last hope.

196
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,994
It sounds like it.

197
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,366
I'm getting all kinds
of crazy in here.

198
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,268
It's this damn old man.

199
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,537
He likes this room a lot.

200
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,972
He looks better.

201
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:38,510
I think he's reverting
to a stage before he got sick.

202
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,478
I think he thinks
this is his room.

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,613
How would he affect
the living?

204
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,615
He likes to jump on the bed.

205
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,419
You know, he likes to watch
the television,

206
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,520
so I think, for the living,

207
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,857
the TV would come on
and off by itself.

208
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,628
This room is just filled with
a dead person's energy,

209
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,167
and I think it's making
the person sick and throwing up.

210
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,870
And for a living person to be
exposed to that for a long time,

211
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,306
they're absorbing
way too much dead energy.

212
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,976
It would be extremely
detrimental.

213
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,744
They're dying.

214
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,688
So, Will,
Mom said you're 14.

215
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,022
Yep.

216
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,592
Did you ever experience
anything you can't explain?

217
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:41,829
Sometimes, like, I'll get
this uncertain feeling in here

218
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:44,599
like there's just constantly
somebody just stalking me,

219
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,134
just always watching me.

220
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,403
You feel like it's a man
or a thing?

221
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,505
I haven't really
put a label on it.

222
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:51,873
Okay. Anything else?

223
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,609
Yeah. I was sitting
in front of the TV,

224
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,044
and it looked like somebody kept
on popping around the corner.

225
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,479
Can you describe him for me?

226
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:02,850
I mean, it was like a black
figure kept on looking at me.

227
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,285
How did you react
when you saw this thing?

228
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,053
It really freaked me out.

229
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,122
I mean, I know I wasn't
just seeing things.

230
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,357
I knew it was there.

231
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,893
What do you think
this thing wants?

232
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,263
I think they're just somebody
just trying to pick

233
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,497
on the family, really,

234
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,400
just trying to tell us,

235
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,903
basically, "Get out."

236
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,816
This feels horrible in here!

237
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,455
God, I feel so sick. Okay.

238
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,223
Constant nausea.

239
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:46,694
The person in here has abilities
without a doubt,

240
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:49,096
probably mediumship,
I'm thinking.

241
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:55,536
I see a war between whoever
is in here and the old man.

242
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,475
The old man is sitting
by the bed,

243
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:04,912
whispering into their ear --

244
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:10,051
disrespectful, lazy, stupid --

245
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:15,022
everything this old man disliked
of anybody when he was alive.

246
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:18,759
He thinks that this person
is a waste of space.

247
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:21,796
I feel like he is
physically doing things,

248
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:23,998
flicking their ear
and their head...

249
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,569
...smacking 'em, pushing.

250
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:33,341
What would the long-term effects
be for this living person?

251
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:39,313
Giving them horrible nightmares,
anxiety issues,

252
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,883
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

253
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,752
The dead guys just
wants them the...out.

254
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,260
So, Amber, I was
talking to your mom.

255
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,628
She thinks that
whatever is here

256
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,663
is going after you
and your brothers.

257
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:58,065
- You agree with her?
-100%.

258
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:01,102
I'm terrified for my family.
Okay.

259
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:03,304
So tell me about
some of the experiences.

260
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,340
I was looking in the mirror
in my bathroom,

261
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,142
and out of the corner
of my eye,

262
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:11,812
I saw something zoom
past down the hallway.

263
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,014
And what was it?

264
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:17,184
It was a dark,
shadowy figure.

265
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:19,420
So I know you saw it quick,
but can you get a sense

266
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,088
if it was an adult
or a kid?

267
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,490
I'm thinking it was adult.

268
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:25,259
I think it was male
because it was kind of taller.

269
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,061
And you're sure it wasn't
coming from somebody else?

270
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:29,363
No, everybody was asleep.

271
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,831
Anything else?

272
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,567
I feel someone watching me

273
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,869
or being around me
all the time.

274
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,872
Okay. So is the presence
like a peeping Tom,

275
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,640
or is it, like,
somebody trying to hurt you?

276
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,108
It's kind of just like
somebody is, like,

277
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,577
staring at me all the time.

278
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,746
It's, like, stalking,
and it just watches me.

279
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,582
It doesn't matter where
I'm at in the house.

280
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,484
It's always, like,
right there.

281
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:51,819
And it's only
when you're here?

282
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,521
- Mnh-mnh.
- Okay.

283
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,356
I went to work the other day
in Knoxville,

284
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,391
and it followed me there.

285
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,595
It was the same presence
as it is at the house.

286
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:03,130
- Okay. Anything else?
- I have nightmares.

287
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:04,632
Can you describe 'em?

288
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,668
One in particular that I had,
all the doors were rattling,

289
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,337
and when I woke up,
I was telling it

290
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:10,805
to get out of the house.

291
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,340
What were you
telling to get out?

292
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,709
I don't know. It was
something very mean, though.

293
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:16,510
I woke up shaking.

294
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:17,979
Anything else?

295
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,315
I was laying in bed, and I had,
like, my hand up like this,

296
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,417
and something just
touched my elbow.

297
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,553
So what kind of touch? Did it
feel like a man's finger?

298
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:28,222
Yeah.
You ever get touched
like that again?

299
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:31,125
Actually, about a month ago,
I got scratched.

300
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,961
I felt a burning sensation
on the back of my calf,

301
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,263
and when I had looked, it was
a whole bunch of scratches,

302
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:37,665
and I have a photo.

303
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,405
And what do you think
is in this house?

304
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,307
Something very mean,

305
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,310
um, and it's trying to hurt
my family.

306
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,981
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks.

307
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:57,018
I just want it gone.

308
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:06,127
There's another dead guy here
who claims to be a cowboy.

309
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,663
He's a predator.

310
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:14,402
I think that he's a sick...

311
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:17,471
I'm seeing him with this girl.

312
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:19,407
I don't know if this is
this girl or some girl

313
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,609
he had when he was alive,

314
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:25,179
but she is uncomfortable
and is not happy now,

315
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,581
knowing that this is not right.

316
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,684
Is he able to physically
interact with the living?

317
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,218
I think so, yes.

318
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,120
There is a molestation there.

319
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,591
So this person here,
I would assume,

320
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,727
would have horrible nightmares,

321
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,497
screaming, scared, seeing a man.

322
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:46,233
I'm worried. I'm just worried.

323
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,369
I feel sick again.

324
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,915
Leonora told me a previous
owner died in her house.

325
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,384
Now the local police
aren't cooperating,

326
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:10,120
so I had a P.I.
look into it for me.

327
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:12,356
He just called back
and says it's true.

328
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:15,025
I'm on my way to meet him now to
find out exactly what happened.

329
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,234
Eddie, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

330
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:25,669
What were you able
to find out about

331
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,771
the previous owners
of my client's property?

332
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,407
Kenneth and Patricia Goodykoontz
was a married couple.

333
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:35,612
They bought your client's
residence in 1964.

334
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,481
This is a picture of Kenneth.

335
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:42,119
- He was retired Air Force.
- Okay.

336
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,420
And he worked as
a local machinist.

337
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,622
All right. So what do
we know about Patricia?

338
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:48,625
She worked at a local
manufacturing company.

339
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:51,094
On the phone, you said they
lived there for over 40 years.

340
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:53,197
Was their time there
good, bad?

341
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
Well, there was
some hardships there.

342
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:57,334
Kenneth lost his mother,
his father,

343
00:16:57,336 --> 00:17:00,103
lost his sister,
lost his brother.

344
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,239
This guy practically
lost his whole family.

345
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,374
So how does Kenneth
wind up dying?

346
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,109
He was diagnosed with cancer.

347
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,179
Well, he finally dies
in May 2006,

348
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:12,149
right there on
your client's property.

349
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,550
So how old was he
when he died?

350
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:16,220
- He was 74 years old.
- Okay.

351
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:17,721
So what about Patricia?
Does she stay in the house?

352
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,257
Yes, and she also
died there as well.

353
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,960
All right. So what were
the circumstances of her death?

354
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,194
Well, August 18, 2015,

355
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:26,129
the family hadn't heard
from her,

356
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:29,166
so they sent the local sheriff
out for a welfare check.

357
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,667
What's he find?

358
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,871
He found Patricia's dead body
laying on the living room floor.

359
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:37,407
- Okay.
- Here's the incident report.

360
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:42,012
Okay. All right.
So she was 77.

361
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:44,448
What was the official
cause of death?

362
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,783
Unfortunately,
the coroner's office

363
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,753
never revealed
a reason of death.

364
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,792
He's blocking me on this.

365
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:59,830
I'm trying to figure out who
this angry, old man was in life.

366
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,064
Can you describe him?

367
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,501
He's, like, 5'5", rail thin.

368
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:07,070
He's white. He's bald.

369
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,973
I think he had
a<i> really</i> hard life.

370
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:17,114
I'm seeing him from two
different stages of his life.

371
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:20,450
When he's looking healthier,

372
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,886
I feel the 1980s.

373
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:27,858
I would say that he was in his
late 40s, early 50s then.

374
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,829
I think he was in his late 70s
when he's dying or dead.

375
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,033
He looks<i> extremely</i> ill.

376
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,502
Does he have any kind of
connection to the property?

377
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,705
He probably owned it, I guess.

378
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:45,409
I think he died here
or, like, was dying here.

379
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:48,145
I'm thinking that he probably
died from cancer.

380
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:55,085
There was a whole --
another person talking.

381
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,553
It's a dead chick.

382
00:18:56,555 --> 00:19:00,958
It seems like it was some kind
of housewife or some...

383
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,493
The chick was crying
and screaming over it.

384
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:07,331
That is not good.

385
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:13,070
So far, I've got
a family being terrorized

386
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:14,938
by physical attacks
on a property

387
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,841
where the previous owners
died in the house,

388
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:20,310
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

389
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:21,645
Searching through old records,

390
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:25,082
I find an article about a man
name Richard Drummond.

391
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:28,352
Turns out Richard was hanged
by an angry mob in the 1890s

392
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,520
less than a mile
from my client's property.

393
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,793
I need to know more about this
hanging near Leonora's house.

394
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,795
Heading over to meet
with an historian

395
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:41,832
who says the whole thing started
with a fight at a brothel.

396
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,105
Well, Stephanie,
thanks for meeting with me.

397
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,040
I appreciate that.

398
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,408
Now this guy,
Richard Drummond,

399
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,744
I know he got hung pretty close
to my client's property.

400
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:54,945
What were the circumstances?

401
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:57,914
In 1893, there was the fight
that broke out

402
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,783
in a local brothel
here in Briceville.

403
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:02,319
All right. So do we know what
started this whole fight?

404
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,355
Some of the soldiers came by
from the nearby Fort Anderson

405
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:08,091
to enjoy the company of
some ladies at the brothel.

406
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,459
They must have upset somebody

407
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:13,697
because the local sheriff
was called in to kick them out,

408
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,867
and one of the miners,
named Richard Drummond,

409
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,535
stepped up
to help the sheriff.

410
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:21,238
And I actually have
a picture of him.

411
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,407
Drummond is helping the sheriff.
What happens next?

412
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,474
Richard Drummond
and the sheriff

413
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,677
were trying to get
the militia out.

414
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,147
In the melee that happened,
Richard Drummond shot and killed

415
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,149
a private named
William Laugherty.

416
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:34,651
- Does the sheriff arrest him?
- No, he didn't.

417
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:37,354
Okay. So now Drummond is free.
What happens next?

418
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:41,058
Well, 2 days later, 16 of
William Laugherty's friends

419
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,627
from the fort
rounded up Richard Drummond

420
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,464
and hung him from the bridge.
- All right.

421
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:48,699
And how far was that bridge
from my client's house?

422
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:50,901
About 4,000 feet
from your client's property.

423
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:52,669
Okay. So his buddies
came back for revenge.

424
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:53,904
Yes, they did.

425
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:55,839
As a matter of fact,
Richard Drummond is buried

426
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:57,541
in an unmarked grave
in this cemetery.

427
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,977
- Right here?
- Yes.

428
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,447
Okay. So did they wind up
arresting the soldiers?

429
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:05,115
Yes, they did, but in
the middle of the trial,

430
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,617
they dropped the charges.
- Any reason why?

431
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,654
Well, it seems that the military
at the state level

432
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:14,057
had enough clout to stop
the trial mid-trial.

433
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,695
Nobody goes to jail
for any of this?
No.

434
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:25,202
I'm seeing that
creepy cowboy guy again.

435
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,137
He's all, like, dressed up.

436
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,807
His outfit looks like
he just went to, like,

437
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,176
a cowboy nightclub
or something.

438
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:34,878
Any idea when this is?

439
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,081
He was saying that

440
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,816
he was around here

441
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,785
in the 1850s.

442
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:44,755
I'm skeptical about his claim

443
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:47,958
to have been
from that time period.

444
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:58,034
This guy comes and goes.

445
00:21:58,036 --> 00:22:00,704
He comes from somewhere else,

446
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:03,406
like a bar.

447
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:06,109
He used to go there.
I think that's where he died.

448
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:09,446
He's saying that somebody
shot his head off.

449
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,748
There's something sexual
with him,

450
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,719
and he likes them young,
if you know what I mean.

451
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:19,289
He goes out hunting,
just like any pedophile.

452
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,892
Back in his day,
it wasn't a big deal, though.

453
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:25,362
That wasn't a thing
that he was persecuted for.

454
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:27,430
He got shot.
He...deserved it.

455
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,707

461
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,670
You know, another thing
caught my eye in research.

462
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,707
There used to be a coal mine
right near my client's house.

463
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:07,444
Now, in 1911, there was
a massive explosion there.

464
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:09,946
I'm on my way to meet with
a local historian who says

465
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:12,115
it was one of the deadliest
coal-mining accidents

466
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:13,450
in U.S. history.

467
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,127
So, Boomer, this explosion
I came across,

468
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,396
it looks like it happened pretty
close to my client's property.

469
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:27,764
What can you tell me
about it?

470
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,399
The entrance of
the Cross Mountain mine

471
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,701
was an adjacent ridge
about a mile

472
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,603
from where your property
your investigating is.

473
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,106
Okay.

474
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,474
...mile and miles of them.

475
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,309
It's very possible that some
of them might have gone

476
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,978
right underneath the property
your investigating.

477
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,146
So, Boomer, do me a favor.

478
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:44,481
Take me through the day
of the accident.

479
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,749
What happened?

480
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:49,452
December 9, 1911,
early in the morning, 7:20 a.m.,

481
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:51,187
the first shift of 89 miners

482
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,256
went into the depths
of the mine,

483
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,591
and shortly after
they entered the mine,

484
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:56,359
there was a violent explosion.

485
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,261
I mean, how massive was it?

486
00:23:58,263 --> 00:23:59,863
It was massive enough
to be felt, you know,

487
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,598
miles away in all directions

488
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,601
and, you know, shook
the mountainside basically.

489
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:05,802
Big smoke cloud, you know,

490
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,370
boiled out of
the entrance of the mine

491
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,105
probably 100 feet in the air.

492
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,544
And people came
from all over

493
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:16,446
the adjacent mining camps,
trying to help.

494
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,882
For the most part,
they were unsuccessful.

495
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:20,984
You know, here's a photograph
shows a lot of the rescue teams

496
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:23,086
that had been gathered
around the front of the mine

497
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,988
to see what
they could do to help.

498
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,424
Wow. Everybody came together
during this explosion?

499
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,659
Yeah, during disasters
like that,

500
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,461
miners will come
from the other mines,

501
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,763
you know, the competing mines
to help their brother miners,

502
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,998
any help they could.

503
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
All right. Boomer,
so 89 men go down there.

504
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:38,234
How many get out?

505
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:40,804
They were able
to rescue five men.

506
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:42,939
Some of the tunnels
partially collapsed.

507
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,312
...anybody that wasn't killed
by the explosion

508
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:51,014
suffocated to death.

509
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:52,582
5 guys are alive,
84 dead.

510
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,117
Any of those bodies
get recovered?

511
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,553
It took 9 days to get everybody
out of the mountain,

512
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,521
but they were able to get
all the victims out.

513
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:00,190
Some were burnt
beyond recognition,

514
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,925
but the last two that were found

515
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,426
had barricaded
themselves off and hoped,

516
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,228
but the rescue never came.

517
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,362
They were too far back
in the mountain.

518
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,264
They couldn't
get to them in time.

519
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:12,168
Jeez.
What a horrible way to go.

520
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,172
So I'm getting a lot
of death.

521
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:23,513
There's bodies on the floor,

522
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:27,417
all together
and buried in a hole together.

523
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,855
I don't know what that's about.

524
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:34,891
And there seem to be
a lot of stairs.

525
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:38,261
Everything's a slick,
solid black

526
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,030
that had something to do
with this location.

527
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:44,400
I'm looking down,
and it turns into soot

528
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:46,970
and then, like, charcoal.

529
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,272
This is really not good.

530
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:01,017
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk, but two stood out.

531
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,986
First, the angry old man.

532
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:07,056
He was probably
in his 40s.

533
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:09,893
He was balding,
and he kind of had

534
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,495
big round eyes,

535
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:14,764
heavy lids.

536
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,434
Next, I described
the creepy cowboy

537
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:20,303
tormenting a living girl.

538
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:23,806
She is laying.

539
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:27,977
There's a male in the room.

540
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,614
Well, he is placing his hand
between the girl's legs.

541
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,591
Is this what you saw?

542
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:42,859
Yes.

543
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:06,108
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

544
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,577
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

545
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,380
and our clients
for the first time.

546
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:13,215
So, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Leonora.

547
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,050
This is her daughter, Amber.

548
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,853
Leonora is about as dedicated
a mom as I've ever seen.

549
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:19,955
She bought this house
so her three kids

550
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,423
could have a better life.

551
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,624
I actually have a photo of
the rest of the family

552
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:24,059
right here.

553
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:28,897
This is her son, Will, who's 14,
and her son, Easton, who's 4.

554
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,602
Leonora adopted Easton to save
him from a bad living situation,

555
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,504
but with all the activity here,

556
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,038
he's not really
in a safer place.

557
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,942
As a matter of fact, nobody is.

558
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,911
With that being said,
I'm gonna ask Amy to,

559
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,212
talk about her walk for us.

560
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:51,753
There are a couple dead people
here that I am concerned about.

561
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:56,658
The first one is an extremely
angry, elderly male.

562
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,895
For whatever reason, his
favorite location in the house

563
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:02,097
is back bedroom
to the left.

564
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,399
Now the bedroom you're talking
about is Leonora's bedroom,

565
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:06,334
and that's where
she sleeps with Easton.

566
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,602
Interesting.

567
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,372
One of the things that
really stood out about him

568
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:13,475
was his distaste
for children.

569
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:15,911
He referred to them
as "the pests,"

570
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:19,047
and he takes
a lot of pleasure

571
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,983
in torturing kids.

572
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:26,388
Tell her how Easton got shoved
and wakes up with the bruises.

573
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,392
I have pictures of bruises
from his rib cage down

574
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:33,495
that wasn't there
the day before,

575
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:36,865
and then I watched him walk,
and it looked like

576
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:40,302
somebody shoved him
really hard from the back.

577
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:43,171
Okay. Interesting.

578
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:45,707
Some of the other things
I saw him doing to the living

579
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,310
was him, like,
stomping on the floors

580
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,179
and making
as much noise as possible.

581
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,250
When he's really upset,
he'll throw things.

582
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:57,519
Describe what happened
with the flashlight to Amy.

583
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:00,422
It was a square flashlight.

584
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:04,993
It was sitting on a table,
and it flew off of the table.

585
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,828
Was anybody else
in the room at the time?

586
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,663
My son was asleep.

587
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,799
- Which son?
- William.

588
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,934
Interesting.

589
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:16,638
I felt like the living
would be able to see him

590
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,074
because he wants you to.

591
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:20,809
So he would go in
the hallway,

592
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:23,778
and he would stand
at the end of the hall

593
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,314
and wait for somebody
to come out of their room.

594
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,917
Both of you guys have seen
dark figures in the hallway.

595
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,218
Yes.

596
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,387
I was standing in the bathroom,
facing the mirror,

597
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,489
and I just caught out
of the corner of my eye,

598
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:38,493
there was a tall, dark
shadow figure moving very fast.

599
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:40,362
Now, you see it a lot
from your bedroom?

600
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,864
I do.
Yeah, it's very scary.

601
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,668
Also, I saw him really
screwing around a lot

602
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,970
with the television, like,
flipping through channels,

603
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:52,541
stations changing, the TV
turning on and off by itself.

604
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,409
Tell her what happens
to your TV in your room.

605
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:56,745
It will come on and off.

606
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:01,950
He has really put his energy
in that room.

607
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:04,486
It's dead energy.

608
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:06,755
It would make you feel
exhausted,

609
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,456
make you sick and nauseous.

610
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,993
It'll just hit me
all of a sudden,

611
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:14,129
um, come out of nowhere

612
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:18,967
and, um, just hit me
pretty hard.

613
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:20,302
And what that does

614
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:22,971
to a living person
absorbing dead energy

615
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:25,540
is it's gonna start
slowly killing you.

616
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:31,479
When I was in
the middle bedroom,

617
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:35,150
he basically told me
that he has declared war

618
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:37,919
on the person in that room.

619
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,854
Yeah, that's Will's room.

620
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:42,657
We all know that room
is the bad room.

621
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,160
He absolutely
just can't stand him.

622
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:47,295
He specifically said,
"I have hated him

623
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,598
since he first came here."

624
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,436
I saw him flicking his ear,
smacking him in the head.

625
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:58,540
I saw him try to give this
living person nightmares,

626
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,309
basically him
just being relentless.

627
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:05,780
To make things worse,
the living person has abilities,

628
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,718
and he is a medium
of some sort,

629
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,556
but it makes him much more
vulnerable to these attacks.

630
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,360
If he's exposed to this
for a long period of time,

631
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:21,663
he can develop PTSD,
anxiety issues,

632
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:25,867
depression issues, all of
these kinds of things.

633
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:29,771
And what the old man
really wants to do

634
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:33,241
is just get him
out of here.

635
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:35,276
He said that
he had saw a face.

636
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,380
Like, he wasn't exactly
completely asleep,

637
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:39,914
and he felt something
was there,

638
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:43,351
so he had opened his eyes
and saw a face.

639
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:45,120
Okay. Interesting.

640
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:47,555
It's very scary
just to think

641
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,525
that this guy hates him
that bad.

642
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,630
Any idea who this guy was
when he was alive?

643
00:31:55,632 --> 00:32:00,268
What I got was that he possibly
owned this place,

644
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,836
that he lived here.

645
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,407
I got the impression that
he had a really hard life.

646
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,742
There were two ages
that I got him at.

647
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:12,480
When he was elderly,
he was frail and thin,

648
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:16,651
and then I saw him
in the back bedroom,

649
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,553
and he looked
a lot healthier.

650
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:20,689
I would say
he was in his 50s.

651
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,959
I got that when he was healthier
was in the '80s, the 1980s,

652
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:27,729
and I felt like
he died in the house

653
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:32,467
from either cancer
or kidney issues or both.

654
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:35,303
I got a pretty good idea of
who the guy is that you saw.

655
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:37,338
Now the previous owners
of your house

656
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,009
were a couple named Kenneth
and Patricia Goodykoontz.

657
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,211
They bought this place
back in 1964

658
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,246
and lived here
for over 50 years.

659
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:47,549
You said this guy hates kids.

660
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,350
I can't say for sure
that this guy, Kenneth,

661
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:51,486
didn't like kids,
but they didn't have any.

662
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,654
You said he had a hard life.

663
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,589
Now he had
a pretty tough time here.

664
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:56,558
While living in this house,
he lost both his parents.

665
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,760
His sister and his brother died.

666
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:02,163
You said the guy you saw was
in his 50s during the 1980s.

667
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,933
Kenneth turned 50 in 1982.

668
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:10,805
In 2006, Kenneth was diagnosed
with cancer at the age of 74.

669
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:13,441
He died in this house
in May of 2006.

670
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:14,909
Matter of fact,
his wife, Patricia,

671
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,413
also died in this house
9 years later in 2015.

672
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,181
Wow.

673
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,851
I got a photo of Kenneth
when he was younger.

674
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,825
Is it possible this is
the guy you saw?

675
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,727
I did have a sketch done.

676
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:41,069
Yeah. This is him.

677
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:46,207
You guys tell me.

678
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,212
It's very close, yeah.

679
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,817
You think this is the guy
you saw?

680
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:58,119
Yeah.

681
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,388
This is the...that
hit your kid.

682
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,693
To be so mean to a child,
I can't comprehend it.

683
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,363
He needs to get the hell
out of my house.

684
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:16,638
So the other person that
I'm worried about is a male.

685
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,540
He's dressed like a cowboy,

686
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,343
but this guy was perfect,
clean-shaven.

687
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:23,912
I was like,
"That is weird."

688
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:26,815
And I got that
he was around here

689
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,984
in the 1840s, in the 1850s.

690
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:34,255
I think that he came
from somewhere else,

691
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:37,659
like a bar or a saloon,
and I think he died there

692
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,094
and that he was shot
in the head.

693
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:43,531
I really feel that
he deserved that

694
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:47,068
and that he should have
gone to hell.

695
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,237
Amy, I gotta tell you,
a few things you talked about

696
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,240
make me think of a guy
I came across in my research.

697
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:55,143
Back in 1893, there was a man
who was shot and killed

698
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:58,479
at a brothel right down the hill
here in Briceville.

699
00:34:58,481 --> 00:34:59,914
Now, his name
was William Laugherty,

700
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,549
and he was 33 years old.

701
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,952
Laugherty was a soldier
that was stationed

702
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:06,054
at Fort Anderson near here.

703
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:08,857
That might explain
the strange outfit you saw.

704
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,359
One night, Laugherty
and his military friends

705
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,961
were partying
at the brothel in town,

706
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,462
trying to pick up women.

707
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,297
He and his buddies
pissed somebody off,

708
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:18,566
and they had to call
the sheriff in to kick him out.

709
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,235
The sheriff had a hard time
trying to get him out,

710
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:23,404
so a local miner jumped in,
and things got worse.

711
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:25,340
The miner shot
and killed Laugherty.

712
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:28,676
The sheriff let the miner go,
but 2 days later,

713
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:31,713
Laugherty's soldier buddies
came back and they lynched him.

714
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,381
What?

715
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,016
This is the article on it.

716
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,085
Now could Laugherty, the guy
who got shot in the bar,

717
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:38,853
be the man you might have seen?

718
00:35:38,855 --> 00:35:40,588
Yes.

719
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,890
Now you said you were concerned
about this guy.

720
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,324
What's his story?

721
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:47,028
I got that he is
an extremely sick individual

722
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,598
who prefers young females.

723
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,635
He was an extremely
sexual person,

724
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:59,874
and I am pretty certain that
he's some kind of a pedophile.

725
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:03,711
You might have the feeling of
intense fear when he's around.

726
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:07,649
He's a very dark,
bad person.

727
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:09,851
He also likes
to influence people

728
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:13,988
through very vivid nightmares
and night terrors.

729
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,025
All of the things he's doing
to living individuals

730
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:21,262
is because he's a hunter
and he's on the prowl always.

731
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,830
Amy, Amber's going through

732
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,666
a lot of the things you're
talking about.

733
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:25,867
Really?

734
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,535
Well, talk about
the nightmares.

735
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:29,570
I had one nightmare where I was
telling something

736
00:36:29,572 --> 00:36:30,972
to get out of the house,

737
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:34,909
and I had woke up actually
saying, "Get out of my house."

738
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:36,611
Now you said this guy
is like a predator, right?

739
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,979
- Yeah.
- Now didn't you tell me

740
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,081
you felt like somebody
in your room was stalking you?

741
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,582
Always, at night, yeah.

742
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,218
He's, like, in the corner,
watching me.

743
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,355
I don't like it at all.
It scares me a lot.

744
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:49,424
Did this guy
do anything else?

745
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:50,992
The biggest thing that I got

746
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,494
is that he can
physically touch the living.

747
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:54,662
Amber has been touched.

748
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:56,731
She's been scratched.
You know what? Tell Amy.

749
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:59,834
I felt something behind me.
I felt a burning sensation.

750
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,469
I looked, and there were
a whole bunch of scratches.

751
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,770
Okay.

752
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:07,976
Also, I saw a disturbing
situation in the back bedroom.

753
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:11,412
I had a sketch done of what
I saw going on back there.

754
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,950
Jeez.

755
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:17,885
I'm sorry, ladies. It's...

756
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,462
He's touching my baby.

757
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,566
Could --

758
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:34,235
could he have touched me
like that without me knowing?

759
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:38,840
'Cause I don't wanna
be touched like that.

760
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,309
So he's probably the one that
follows me around all the time?

761
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,378
Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,081
Easton has talked about a man
in a white cowboy hat.

763
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,283
He has called him
the Big Guy.

764
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:52,353
That's not good.

765
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,522
And, like, when you were
talking to me, and you're like,

766
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:57,158
"Well, he's got bruises and this
and this," and I'm like,

767
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,495
"I know the old man
is not doing that to him."

768
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:03,031
It's this sick jerk.

769
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:11,072
I knew some things were going on
with Easton, but I had no idea.

770
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:15,376
If this monster is going to
terrorize any of my kids,

771
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,078
I feel very guilty.

772
00:38:21,117 --> 00:38:23,651
You okay, sweetie?

773
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,387
I just... I don't
want that to happen to him ever.

774
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:45,938
So, Leonora, you were worried
your children

775
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,408
were in danger here,
and you are 100% right.

776
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,976
But we still haven't answered
the big question --

777
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:53,245
Can you stay here safely
with the kids,

778
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,648
or do you need to pack them up
and get the hell out of here?

779
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,350
Now for that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

780
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,122
There's a lot
you have to do.

781
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:07,759
The first thing is to bring in
a medium to sit down

782
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:13,365
and have a very clear discussion
with this elderly man.

783
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,134
They need to go over the fact
that he's deceased.

784
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:18,170
It's time for him
to move on.

785
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,905
Okay, so now once
the old guy is gone,

786
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,740
is Will gonna stop
getting messed with?

787
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:25,677
Yes. All that stuff's
gonna stop.

788
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,348
Okay. Now the cowboy.

789
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,350
Obviously, this guy is
just a piece of...

790
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,652
that needs to go, period.

791
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:36,955
You need to bring in
a male and a female medium

792
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,325
<i>and</i> a demonologist.

793
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:45,030
Tell the mediums that
it's gonna be a rough one.

794
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,532
He might get physical
with them,

795
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:49,668
and that's why you have
the demonologist there.

796
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,004
So the demonologist can
step in if this pervert tries

797
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,072
to get rough
with the mediums?

798
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:56,208
Absolutely.

799
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,809
So it's kind of like,
okay, you know,

800
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,745
"We're going to try
and do this the nice way.

801
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:03,248
You get pissy, and we got
our big gun here."

802
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,753
Basically, they do
a type of exorcism.

803
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,688
Both of your sons
have abilities.

804
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,890
Will is going to
naturally close down,

805
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,594
but Easton won't, so the last
thing I want you to do

806
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:19,565
is he needs to see
a child psychotherapist.

807
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,401
He's going to have
experiences,

808
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,704
and it's better to go
through those experiences

809
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:32,110
with someone that he can
talk to and who can help him.

810
00:40:32,112 --> 00:40:35,914
He needs to learn as many
protection measures

811
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,883
as he possibly can,

812
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:40,852
and that'll help him
to prevent PTSD,

813
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:44,590
anxiety, depression,
all of these things.

814
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,558
So when you adopted Easton,

815
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,061
you adopted a lot more
than you thought.

816
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,896
I'd do it again.

817
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:53,065
Well, you might have saved
this kid's future

818
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:56,635
by finding out this stuff now.
- Yeah.

819
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:59,538
I know it's a lot, but you're
gonna take Amy's advice?

820
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,406
Most definitely.

821
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:03,575
Knowing what to do
to protect us now

822
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:05,410
and protect Easton
and even Will...

823
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:06,912
Right.

824
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,581
...they will be a lot better
overall after all this is done.

825
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,950
And I feel like
we have a path now,

826
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:14,086
a way that we can
make things better

827
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:18,557
and that I know we can
help Easton in life,

828
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,792
and we will take this journey
right along with him.

829
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,494
It's a lot of work.

830
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:24,162
- It's worth it.
- Yeah.

831
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,798
He needs to be protected.

832
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,002
I really hope Leonora
and Amber contact a demonologist

833
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,638
and mediums
to remove the old man

834
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,407
and the cowboy
terrorizing their family.

835
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,343
If they do that and get Easton
the help he needs,

836
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:40,112
they can free their family
of evil

837
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:42,147
and lead a peaceful life.
