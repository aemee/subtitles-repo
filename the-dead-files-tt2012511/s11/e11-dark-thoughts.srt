1
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,412
The house just feels bad.

2
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,215
I hear a dangerous telepath.

3
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,950
And they think it's
physically attacked.

4
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,551
He can't breathe.
He's hyperventilating.

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,920
He's freaking out.

6
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,524
I heard him yell out,
"Leave me alone."

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,725
We have reports
of him threatening

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,160
to kill anyone
who approached him.

9
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,828
And I feel bad for the kid.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,964
No wonder he's all...up.

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:36,935
So I don't know if this
person is insane or a sensitive.

12
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,138
This is not a good situation.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,206
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,574
There's death here.

15
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,443
Don't want to go down there.

16
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,844
I see dead people.

17
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,880
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

18
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,649
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,185
She's definitely
a serial killer.

20
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,853
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,489
She's going to torture them.

22
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,993
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

23
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,061
They were all murdered.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,663
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,165
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective...

27
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,569
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

28
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,606
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

29
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,310
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

30
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,245
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,780
Who do you think possessed you?

32
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,615
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,717
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,952
Until the very end.

35
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,520
Well, you're not going
to want to see this.

36
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,989
What we uncover is if it's safe
for you to stay...

37
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,391
Hell no.

38
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,759
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,428
Everyone is in jeopardy.

40
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,479
I'm in Waterford, Connecticut,

41
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,447
about 50 miles
south of Hartford.

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,015
I got a call from a woman
named Linda.

43
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,151
Now, she sounded really bad.

44
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:02,054
Told me whatever is in the house
broke up her marriage,

45
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,122
and now it's torturing
one of her kids.

46
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,824
She told me she's
barely hanging on,

47
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,626
and we are her very last hope.

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,564
Before Amy arrives,

49
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,767
I clear the area
of any leading information.

50
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:22,074
Photographs, personal items
and even religious symbols

51
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:25,577
have to be covered or removed.

52
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,913
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

53
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,895
I don't feel good.

54
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,564
Somebody here

55
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:51,069
is making me
excruciatingly sick.

56
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,106
I seriously want to vomit.

57
00:02:54,108 --> 00:03:00,913
It feels like it's a male
who's very angry.

58
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,615
We might have to go to the
hospital, like, right now.

59
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,493
So, Linda, when we spoke
on the phone

60
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,661
you sounded terrified.

61
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,930
There's something
really bad here, evil,

62
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,567
terrorizing my family,
ripping us apart.

63
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,168
How long have you been
living here?

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,172
I inherited from my father,
and we moved in 2009.

65
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,041
What did he pass from,
if you don't mind me asking?

66
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,343
He never told us
what he passed away from,

67
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,880
but the death
certificate said cancer.

68
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,982
That's the kind
of person he was,

69
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,817
just kept things to himself.

70
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,385
Did he die in the house?
No, he didn't.

71
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,887
He died in a hospital.
Okay.

72
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,323
Was he sick while
he was living here?

73
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,691
Yes, he was.

74
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,925
You know, he doesn't sound
like much of a talker,

75
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,595
but do you know if he had
an experiences here?

76
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,297
He did mention he would
hear footsteps,

77
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,567
people walking around,
jiggling door handles.

78
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,371
I wrote it off as him, maybe,
going a little senile.

79
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,406
Now, Linda, do you have
any knowledge

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,874
of the history of
this house or anything?

81
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,311
The only thing that I was that
somebody had committed suicide

82
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,647
in the basement
and hung themselves.

83
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,182
Well, I'll look into that.
Okay.

84
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,818
So, Linda, who exactly
lives in the house?

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,821
Well, here's a picture.

86
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,925
It's my husband,
me and younger son,

87
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,260
Eric, and I have
an older son, Nathan,

88
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,030
who lives here that doesn't want
to be part of this at all.

89
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,532
What do you mean doesn't want
to be of, of this investigation?

90
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,734
Yeah.

91
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,902
He's bothered too much
by what's here.

92
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,505
He just doesn't want
to be involved in it.

93
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,540
I don't know how good
this investigation can go

94
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,542
without me knowing
everything I can

95
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,910
with him not talking to me.

96
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,512
Yeah.
I feel helpless.

97
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't know what to do.

98
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,017
So, Linda, give me an idea what
you guys are experiencing here.

99
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:50,789
Well, we've been experiencing
growling, mood swings,

100
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,093
our health is getting bad
and physical attacks.

101
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,695
Tell me more about the sickness.

102
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,796
What's going on with that?

103
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:02,534
Chest pains, nausea,
trouble breathing.

104
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,870
Now, you said the house
causes mood swings.

105
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,672
We argue a lot.

106
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,408
Things have gotten so bad
between Robie and I

107
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,310
that he had moved out
6 months ago.

108
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,912
His moods changed.

109
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,647
I've changed.

110
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,050
You know, nobody
got along anymore.

111
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,719
Relationships, they go bad,
so I don't know

112
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,020
if that's a problem
with the house

113
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,288
or if it's personal.

114
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,224
How was Robie before
you guys moved in here?

115
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,627
He was fun to be around.

116
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,130
We come here and he's, like,
doesn't want to talk

117
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,633
and just, kind of, moody and...

118
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,734
What about you?

119
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,202
How were you before
you moved in here?

120
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,439
I was a happy-go-lucky
person, and I come in here,

121
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,407
and now I'm, like, miserable.

122
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,709
I've got to be blunt.
I got to ask you.

123
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,177
Why don't you just get
the hell out of here?

124
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm a little stubborn.
It's my house.

125
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,115
I'm hoping that we can
correct the problem

126
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,051
and get rid of what's here
and live a normal life,

127
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,755
and live a peaceful life
with no arguing, fighting,

128
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,292
or anything else that goes along
with what's in this house.

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,034
The guy who is making me sick,

130
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:15,941
it's like his energy
fills the walls.

131
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:19,678
He's so, almost,
a part of the house.

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,114
To me, I don't know how anybody
could be in here without,

133
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,782
like, just vomiting.

134
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,953
And it's not only his horrible,
horrible anger issue,

135
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,822
but also his sickness.

136
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,161
It's, like, embedded in
the walls,

137
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,464
and really thick.

138
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,833
The house just feels bad.

139
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,475
Okay.
So Nathan sleeps here?

140
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,878
Yes.
Which bed does he sleep in?

141
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,112
Top.

142
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,747
The bottom is supposed
to be for the dog,

143
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,048
but he won't come in.

144
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,216
Interesting.
Okay.

145
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,519
So now, since Nathan
won't talk to me,

146
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,988
can you describe to me
what he's experiencing?

147
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,324
Well, he's experienced
growling and howling.

148
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,127
Where?
The basement.

149
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,328
Now, have you heard this, too?

150
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,663
I've heard the howling.

151
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,998
How's the howling sound
to you?

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,099
Does it sound like an animal?

153
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,801
The animal
I've never heard before.

154
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,169
You've got woods back here.

155
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,104
Are you sure it wasn't an animal
that got into the house?

156
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,574
No. No.
Okay. What else?

157
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,576
Nathan gets physically
attacked a lot.

158
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,478
Okay.
Describe some of them for me.

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,914
He feels stabbing pains
in his legs

160
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,448
and his neck and in his back,

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,685
and then he's been in the shower
and he's been pushed.

162
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,886
Okay.
Anything else?

163
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,389
Just that he sees
this little creature

164
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,657
hopping down the hallway

165
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,893
and then squatting in
his room tormenting him.

166
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,669
My God!

167
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,370
I'm seeing all kinds
of crazy...

168
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,273
going down on the bed.

169
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,277
What I'm seeing,
it's predator looking.

170
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,613
So it comes up and it
slithers along,

171
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,115
and then it's got arms
when it goes down.

172
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,522
It kind of reminds me
of those weird jellyfish things.

173
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,757
This thing has a face.

174
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,926
More human looking, I think.

175
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,330
It's always changing its face.

176
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,065
I don't even know what thing is.

177
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,133
I don't know if anybody
could sleep in here

178
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,969
because if somebody is up here,

179
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,004
they're getting
the full-on experience.

180
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,772
The bed would be shaking.

181
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,175
They're feeling irritated
not being able to sleep

182
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,412
because of the constant energy.

183
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,082
This would make
anybody go crazy.

184
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,224
Okay. So now we talked about
your son's issues.

185
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,893
Let's talk about you.
What's going on?

186
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,761
I wake up sometimes
with bruising,

187
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,030
and I didn't go to bed
with the bruising.

188
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,199
Did they ever check
your white blood cell count?

189
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,935
Anything wrong with that?
I get physicals every year.

190
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,904
And nothing is going on?
Nothing.

191
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,272
Okay. Anything else?

192
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,775
Well, I woke up to my bed
violently shaking.

193
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,076
How violently are we talking?

194
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,411
Can you show me?

195
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,581
Like enough to wake me up.

196
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,117
And then I feel like
I'm in a ring of fire.

197
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,219
So when you say a ring of fire,
do you, like, wake up

198
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,454
and you see flames around you,
or you just feel that way?

199
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,025
No. I feel it.
Like I'm burning in hell.

200
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,160
It happens quite a bit.
All right.

201
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,930
So how are you and Nathan
dealing with all this?

202
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,533
Well, I talk to him.

203
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,635
He pulls out his bible a lot...

204
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,937
Okay.

205
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,705
And he calls to God
and Jesus

206
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:38,176
to help him, and...

207
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,378
That's okay.

208
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,614
Trying to get through
this whole thing.

209
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,516
Yeah.
I try to help.

210
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,886
He gets mad because I don't read
the bible as much as I should.

211
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,554
You're trying, though.
Yeah.

212
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,290
Okay.
I've tried all the options.

213
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,427
You people were my last resort.

214
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,399
Boy.

215
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,969
I'm hearing dangerous telepath.

216
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,372
I guess the person in here
has telepathy

217
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:14,045
and might be influencing
other people in the house

218
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:19,084
who might not really
be having experiences,

219
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,587
but rather they're
induced by this person.

220
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:33,598
So this telepath thought, I want
to protect who's ever in here,

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,703
but their true intention is
they want something to happen,

222
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:43,475
so inadvertently
they create something

223
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,911
that is actually
going to scare.

224
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,217
So is that jellyfish thing
you saw on the bed real?

225
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,886
No. This thing is a
manifestation of

226
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,555
that person's true intentions,

227
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,625
so it would be terrifying,
I think.

228
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,622
So, Eric, I was talking
to your mom earlier

229
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:24,625
and she's having a lot
of experiences here.

230
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:25,826
What about you?

231
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:27,261
Have you seen anything
you can't explain?

232
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,595
One time I was in the kitchen

233
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:31,398
and I seen the cat
get swept off its feet.

234
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,499
All four feet.

235
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,435
It got swept on its side.

236
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,570
Well, you know, Eric,
cats do funny things.

237
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,807
You know, they say animals
see things that people don't.

238
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,376
It's seeing something.
Definitely.

239
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:43,610
So anything else?

240
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,546
No.
No experience.

241
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:47,047
So I'm curious.

242
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,817
Why do you think everybody else
is effected, but you're not?

243
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,552
Personally, I just,
I believe in it,

244
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:52,786
I just don't let it get to me.

245
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,288
I just won't let it.

246
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,956
Okay.
That's fair enough.

247
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,459
Your mom, she thinks that
whatever is in this house

248
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:00,794
is causing everybody
to fight with each other.

249
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:01,929
Do you agree with that?

250
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,330
Yeah.
I agree.

251
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:06,533
My mom, my brother
and my stepfather,

252
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,702
it's like a triangle.
They all fight.

253
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,337
Is there a drastic change
in their personalities.

254
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,239
Yeah. Yeah.
Big time.

255
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:14,775
Now, it's funny
you mention brother.

256
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,109
He doesn't even want
to talk to me

257
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,345
about this whole situation
that's going on here.

258
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:20,347
No.
He keeps it bottled up inside.

259
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,882
He doesn't really
talk much about it.

260
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,250
Yeah.
Have you seen it affect him?

261
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:25,853
Yeah. I've heard him yell out,
"Leave me alone,"

262
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:29,590
and "stop bothering them,"
and he's even cried before.

263
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,859
So whatever it is it's not good.

264
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:39,099
I'm getting panic, panic, panic.

265
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,336
I see a younger person in here,
and I see panic

266
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:49,009
and, like, sweating
and freaking the...out.

267
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,644
He can't breathe.
He's hyperventilating.

268
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,213
He's freaking out.
He's crying.

269
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:54,815
Okay. So this person

270
00:12:54,817 --> 00:13:00,888
is hearing
and seeing things.

271
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,056
This is causing, like,

272
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:06,093
super-duper,
crazy panic attacks.

273
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:10,197
So he was a awake and he saw
and heard something,

274
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,300
literally doing one of these,

275
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,668
covering his ears

276
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,770
trying to make it stop.

277
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:20,140
It almost feels like the walls
are closing in on him.

278
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,482
So I don't know if this person
is insane or a sensitive.

279
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:36,990
Robie, I understand
you are Linda's husband.

280
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,158
Yes.

281
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,226
This paranormal stuff,
do you believe in it

282
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:40,827
or did you believe in it?

283
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,363
I didn't.
I do now.

284
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,832
So what was it that changed you
from being a skeptic

285
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,601
to a believer?

286
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,970
I believe it was the howling
that I heard.

287
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,572
Linda actually heard it also.

288
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,707
All the hairs
on my arms stand up.

289
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,975
Okay.

290
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,477
It was like something
you would hear in a movie.

291
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,812
All right.
Anything else?

292
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:01,481
Some health issues.
Okay. Like what?

293
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,916
Ulcerative colitis.

294
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,952
That put me in the hospital
for a couple weeks.

295
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:05,986
I get dizzy a lot.

296
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,621
I don't know what it is,
you know?

297
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,122
The doctors ever figure out
what the hell was wrong?

298
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,525
No. They don't know
what was wrong with that.

299
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:12,726
How do you feel now
that you're not here?

300
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,994
I mean, I feel good.

301
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:15,495
Any problems with
your colitis and all?

302
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:17,364
No.
Interesting.

303
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,299
Okay, so, anything else?

304
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,602
I've seen shadow figures.

305
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:22,736
Okay.
Where?

306
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,405
In the dining room area, there.

307
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,875
They were just fast
moving shadows.

308
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:32,179
They moved so fast I really
couldn't get a shape on them.

309
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:35,482
Now, have you ever seen other
shadow figures any place else?

310
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,218
In the kitchen in front
of the kitchen sink.

311
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,321
Now, Linda mentioned to me
that she thought your mood

312
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,657
and your personality changed
when you moved here.

313
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,258
Yes.
You agree with that?

314
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,526
Yes, I do.

315
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,295
I think my attitude,
it got worse.

316
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,696
I don't know.

317
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,999
It just seems like little things
were bothering me, you know?

318
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,800
Now, what about Linda?

319
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,268
Basically, the same thing.

320
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,470
But let me ask you a question.

321
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,371
If my partner turns around
and says, "Listen,

322
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,039
a paranormal in this house

323
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,874
is what caused you guys
to fight all the time,"

324
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,010
would you consider getting
back with your wife?

325
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,711
Personally, yes I would.

326
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:07,280
My feeling is I would
like to get back.

327
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,654
I'm seeing a deceased female.

328
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,522
She is 16.

329
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:19,593
She seems extremely confused.

330
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:21,762
She looks like a dissection.

331
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:26,800
She's got, like,
various stages of tissue,

332
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,935
and then there's muscle,
and then there's bone,

333
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:31,872
but it's also rotting
and there's, like, maggots.

334
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,442
So she's a mess.

335
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:40,380
She was dancing with, I guess,
a male that she had a crush on,

336
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:44,718
and then that same
male attacked her,

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,490
and then he threw her down
a hill, and then she's dead.

338
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:57,164
She says, "I want to make
a nest so I can sleep."

339
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:02,969
She says the living keep
waking her up so she gets upset.

340
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:05,806
She's showing me her walking,
and it's weird, so

341
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:13,213
I'm not sure if they're seeing
her, like a shadow person.

342
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:16,416
She wants to nest,
I think, in the closet.

343
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:22,089
Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

344
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,190
What happened?

345
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,593
She... freaked the...
out and went...

346
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:30,630
She, like, went into my head

347
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:32,165
and went out my neck,

348
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,701
and it hurt.
That hurt.

349
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,759
Linda says she's been
scratched and bruised,

350
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,861
and I don't doubt
her for a second,

351
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,129
but she also said she hears

352
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,698
howling and growling
sounds indoors.

353
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,667
To me, not everything
is paranormal

354
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:00,901
so I'm heading back
to the house to meet

355
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,236
with a pest control expert

356
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,805
to see if some kind of
wildlife could be responsible.

357
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,345
So here's the deal.

358
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:13,414
My clients in the house
are complaining about waking up

359
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,815
with scratches

360
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:18,352
and hearing howling noises
and growling inside the house.

361
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,887
They're convinced
it's the paranormal.

362
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,623
Call me crazy, call me kooky,
but couldn't it be wildlife?

363
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,258
There's a number of things
it could be,

364
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,794
anything from a raccoon
to a squirrel.

365
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,895
Could be bats.

366
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,063
So if you could do me a favor

367
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,498
and give the house
a thorough once-over...

368
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,999
Yep.

369
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,267
And inspect it for me
and let me know what you find.

370
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,768
Absolutely.
Excellent. Thank you, buddy.

371
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,403
Thank you.

372
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,941
With all the strange sounds
Linda and her family

373
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:44,678
are hearing I know I have
to rule out the obviously first.

374
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:50,017
And if there isn't
a physical explanation,

375
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,720
our only hope for answers
will have to come from Amy.

376
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,655
Okay.
So what'd you find?

377
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,290
Less than nothing.

378
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,892
Not even mouse droppings.

379
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,894
You found no evidence that
an animal

380
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,663
or any kind of wildlife
could have caused scratching,

381
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,665
growling, howling,
any of that stuff?

382
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,766
Correct.

383
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:06,934
Well, I appreciate
your time and your help.

384
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,702
Thank you so, so much.
Thank you.

385
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,776
I'm seeing that dead
teenage girl again.

386
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,846
How might the living
experience her?

387
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,083
I know that when she gets upset
she might scratch people.

388
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:25,953
She also, you know, can make
people feel really,

389
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:28,255
really cold or hot.

390
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,827
Dead girl is out here,

391
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,865
and I hear crying
from back there, weeping.

392
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:43,470
So I'm thinking maybe
the living are hearing

393
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,606
a female crying and weeping.

394
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,611
So far I've got a client
who believes the paranormal

395
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,747
is ripping her family apart.

396
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,817
She also believes someone
killed themselves in her house,

397
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,153
so I'm at the library
to see if that's true.

398
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,224
Sure enough, I find a man
named Anthony Ventamiglia

399
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,927
who hung himself
right in Linda's basement.

400
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,866
So I got a local P.I.
looking into this suicide for me

401
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:16,270
and he tells me the poor guy who
hung himself in Linda's house

402
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:19,039
had a long, sad history
of mental illness.

403
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,580
Okay. So what did you find out
about this guy's background?

404
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,282
Well, we know that
Anthony Ventamiglia

405
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,651
came to the United States
son of Italian immigrants.

406
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,654
His father, Vincenzo,
was a laborer for

407
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,090
the Boston and Maine railroad.

408
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,791
At some point in the 1920s

409
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:40,294
Vincenzo started to develop
mental health issues.

410
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,296
He was hospitalized
at the New York State hospital

411
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,698
until his death in 1938.
Okay.

412
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,969
So it's 1938, Vincenzo is dead,
so what happens to Anthony?

413
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,438
Anthony ends up enlisting
in the United States Army

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,674
and actually serves
in World War II

415
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:55,109
as a warrant officer.
Okay.

416
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,543
That tells me a lot
about the guy already.

417
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:58,178
I mean, he had to be
enlisted at some point,

418
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,346
becomes a warrant officer,

419
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,614
which, when I was
in the Marine Corps,

420
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,183
was a lot more respected
than your regular officers.

421
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,251
Correct.
All right.

422
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,086
So, Jimmy, when does
he wind up here?

423
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:09,223
In 1959, Anthony
and his mother, Domenica,

424
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:10,591
buy this house, right here,

425
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,260
and actually are the first
residents of this house.

426
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,062
Wait, so him and his mother?
Correct.

427
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,764
Okay. Married? Kids?

428
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,066
He never got married,
and he didn't have any kids.

429
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,234
All right. So, Jimmy,
when does this guy

430
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:21,969
start going a little crazy?

431
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,138
Well, it's hard to pinpoint
an exact time.

432
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,208
By the mid 1980s, he was
having psychotic episodes.

433
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,711
We have reports of him running
around the neighborhood

434
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,780
in his underwear wielding
a knife threatening

435
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,181
to kill anyone
who approached him.

436
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,582
Okay. Does he ever get
arrested for that?

437
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,851
No. He never gets arrested.
All right.

438
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,254
Do we know if he ever
had counseling, medication?

439
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,588
It doesn't appear that he did.

440
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,191
It appears that he became more
and more of a recluse

441
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,560
and confined himself
to the house.

442
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,761
When does he kill himself?

443
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,763
November 14th, 1987.

444
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,532
Anthony is 70 years old.

445
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:53,634
I actually have
the death certificate.

446
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,505
All right. So where does he wind
up hanging himself?

447
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,140
According to the police report,
he hung himself right here

448
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:03,110
in the basement
on the center beam.

449
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,478
Okay.

450
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,879
So it's possible he hung himself
right here, literally.

451
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,748
Correct.
Okay. So now Anthony is dead.

452
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,183
What happens to the house?

453
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,752
Believe it or not,
Domenica is still alive

454
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,787
and she's forced
to sell the house

455
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,056
and move into a nursing home,

456
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,526
and she dies in 1989
at the age of 102.

457
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,594
That's a pretty sad story

458
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:22,296
because this guy
had a lot of potential.

459
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,764
He did.

460
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,332
Unfortunately, he had some of
the same mental health issues

461
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,067
that his father had.

462
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:35,676
Wow. It doesn't feel good
in this area.

463
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:37,578
I hear a man crying over there,

464
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,414
and he's sitting on a chair
and he's crying.

465
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,916
Maybe he's, like, 50.

466
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:50,157
Maybe a little older, like,
more probably 60s.

467
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,926
Something very traumatic
happened to him

468
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:55,162
and he's not dealing
with it well.

469
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,235
But I think people would feel
that depression down here, I do.

470
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,836
Yeah.
I just feel anxiety.

471
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:03,804
I feel cold over there.

472
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,739
I feel stressed.
I feel chaos.

473
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,309
It's, kind of, making me
a little crazy in my mind.

474
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,978
My head spins.

475
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,913
You know, somebody
dropped dead here.

476
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,748
Male, dead, boom.

477
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,224

483
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,922
You know, another thing got
my attention in research.

484
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:48,524
Back in the '90s a dead body

485
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:51,093
was found a couple of thousand
feet from Linda's house.

486
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,594
I'm heading over to meet
a former cop

487
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,096
who's familiar with the case,

488
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:55,831
and he says the victim
was a rich kid

489
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,633
who got in way
over his head.

490
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,307
Well, Mike, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.

491
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,677
Now, the body they found right
by my client's property,

492
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,845
what can you tell me about that?

493
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,347
It was the body of James Connor.

494
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,018
He's an individual who went
to a prestigious private school

495
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,920
and he went to college at

496
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:19,821
South Connecticut
State University.

497
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:21,323
His nickname was Captain Jim

498
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:24,660
because he had a business
piloting yachts in the area.

499
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,728
Okay. So this guy sounds like
he came from

500
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,463
the upper crust of society,
right?

501
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:31,133
Yeah.
Okay. So what happened?

502
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:33,101
I think he fell into
the wrong crowd,

503
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,337
got addicted to crack cocaine.

504
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:37,339
Well, on August 23rd, 1998,

505
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,675
that's when Connor
leaves a bar in Essex

506
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,476
and he drives down
to New London

507
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:45,080
to a drug haven to score some
crack cocaine from three thugs.

508
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:48,784
One of them was named
Gregory Pierre, aka Coyote.

509
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,586
I can see where this is
going already, but all right.

510
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:51,954
So what happens next?

511
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:55,591
Coyote and two of his thugs,
they decide to rob Connor

512
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,225
instead of selling
the crack cocaine,

513
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,794
and I think, basically,

514
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,662
they beat him to death
with metal pipes,

515
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:03,065
but they also shot him
twice in the head.

516
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,834
Okay. So, Mike, what was
the official cause of death?

517
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,803
Initially they believed
the cause of death

518
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:10,372
was the gunshot wound and
probably the loss of blood...

519
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,440
Okay.

520
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:12,975
But as they further
looked into it,

521
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,243
there was multiple blows to
the head with these metal pipes,

522
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,511
and actually,
one of the reports, Steve, says

523
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:18,113
they actually put a pipe
down his throat

524
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,314
and snapped his neck.

525
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,916
Okay.

526
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,017
So they kill this rich guy.

527
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,785
What do these thugs do next?

528
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,287
They try to hide the evidence.

529
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,655
They dump his body, probably,

530
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,490
within 1,000 feet
of your client's house.

531
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:31,426
Well, then they drive Connor's
down here and they, actually,

532
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,696
try to sink it in this pond,
right here, which is crazy

533
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,499
because the police department
is right next to the pond.

534
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,935
Okay. Thank god they're stupid.
Yeah.

535
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,637
The police found the car
early the next morning

536
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,738
because it didn't sink.

537
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,139
It was only partially submerged.
All right.

538
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:46,208
So how'd they wind up
catching these three mutts?

539
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,210
Well, they were
sloppy criminals, Steve.

540
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:50,512
They actually end up
leaving a lot of blood

541
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:51,813
stains in Connor's car...

542
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:53,048
Okay.

543
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,783
And they went around
talking about it publicly,

544
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,252
you know, bragging
about their crime.

545
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:00,656
Here's a article on the arrests.

546
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:02,257
All right, Mike, so what did
these guys

547
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:03,392
wind up getting charged with?

548
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,726
They were charged
with felony murder.

549
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,095
They go to trial and they up
getting convicted.

550
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:08,730
All three of them
got 85 years in jail.

551
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:11,333
All right. So, Mike, you and I
both worked the crack epidemic

552
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,235
back in the day.
Yeah.

553
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:14,469
Very rare, though,
did you see somebody

554
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,972
from an affluent community
get mixed up with crack.

555
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,807
Obviously he had
no street smarts.

556
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,276
Yeah. It doesn't sound like
he was smart enough

557
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,711
to know what was actually
going to happen to him.

558
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,713
Okay.

559
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:34,256
I saw a flash of a male.

560
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:39,194
Very tall, he's like 6 foot.

561
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:41,997
I think he's between 40 and 42.

562
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,398
He was very wealthy.

563
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,034
Do you have any idea
how he died?

564
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:49,504
He tells me he was
strangled or choked.

565
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,373
He wasn't exactly sure.

566
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,876
He knows that he felt
pressure around his throat.

567
00:25:54,878 --> 00:26:00,215
He just wants to
find his way out.

568
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:03,885
There was a male involved,
and he said about his male,

569
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:07,355
"I guess it was blind jealousy.
Always wanted what I had."

570
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,058
Something very traumatic
happened to him,

571
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,561
and it was really bad.

572
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,737
I encountered several
disturbing things on my walk,

573
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:24,106
but two stood out.

574
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:26,508
First, the strange-looking
creature in the bedroom

575
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,243
with the bunk beds.

576
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:32,948
It had, like, these feather
things around its head.

577
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:39,888
It would change its face.

578
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,291
The body was kind of
like a jellyfish.

579
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,163
Next, I described
the dead teenage girl

580
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:49,798
attacking the living.

581
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:56,471
There's this deceased female,
and when people disturb her

582
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:59,374
she tends to lash out
and scratch them.

583
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:10,018
Amy, is this what
you saw?

584
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,887
Yes. That's what I saw.

585
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:33,525
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

586
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,627
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

587
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:38,664
and our clients,
for the first time.

588
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:42,901
Well, Amy, this is Linda and her
soon to be ex-husband, Robie.

589
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:44,236
And I got to tell you,
this investigation

590
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:45,637
was very frustrating for me

591
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,973
because the person who's
getting the worst of it here

592
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,308
refused to talk to me.

593
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,442
Linda's son, Nathan,

594
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,511
wanted absolutely
nothing to do with us.

595
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:54,780
Bottom line is I'm still glad
we took the case

596
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:56,248
because things here
are getting violent,

597
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,117
and Linda's afraid somebody
is going to get hurt.

598
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,253
So now that I introduced
Amy to you guys,

599
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,121
I'll have her describe
her walk for us.

600
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,559
So when I first got here

601
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,762
I suddenly felt
overcome with nausea.

602
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:14,433
I almost felt like I was just
going to start vomiting,

603
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:17,469
and I thought, okay,
if I feel this way,

604
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:19,638
then I would assume that
the living people here

605
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,874
would feel this way,
and feel it very often

606
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:26,211
because this was
absolutely debilitating.

607
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:31,049
I was nervous that I wouldn't be
able to even perform the walk.

608
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,585
Amy, you're hitting on one
of the reasons called us in.

609
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,153
Tell Amy about
the health issues, here.

610
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,722
Yeah.

611
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:41,059
Nausea, chest pains,
never feel good.

612
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:42,594
My son, Nathan, remember?

613
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,996
He'd always come in gray

614
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:47,766
and run to the bathroom
and start vomiting.

615
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,103
I mean, everybody never felt
good around here at all.

616
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,043
So when I walked
into the house

617
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:02,114
I felt an incredibly
terrible energy

618
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,549
that was emanating
from a dead guy

619
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:07,986
who, I think, was here
in the '80s or the '90s.

620
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:11,156
His energy just, kind of,
was absorbed by the home

621
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:13,959
and is, like,
pouring out of the walls.

622
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,194
The living people
would definitely be

623
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,230
affected by this energy,

624
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:21,466
and it's a lot of anger,
irritation.

625
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,936
I felt like you would hear
yelling and screaming.

626
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:28,140
And then, I felt like there was
a definite living male

627
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,608
who's here,

628
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,376
who resides here,

629
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,913
who is experiencing
this severe anger.

630
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:37,449
Nathan.
Okay.

631
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:40,152
So before we get into Nathan,
now is probably a good time

632
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,854
to tell you about one of
the main reasons we're here.

633
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:44,856
Now, Linda and Robie
are about to divorce

634
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:46,391
after 9 years of marriage,

635
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:48,093
and both of them
think it's because

636
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,228
the house changed
their personalities.

637
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,364
Everything was okay for a while

638
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:56,034
and then we just slowly,
we didn't realize it,

639
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:57,936
we would argue and bicker

640
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,505
and argue and bicker
over nothing.

641
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,708
Do you think it's the house
that did this to them?

642
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,144
It could be a result
of the negative energy.

643
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:08,447
And then you guys are
projecting this yelling

644
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,649
and screaming
into the walls as well,

645
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:12,984
and then it's all
playing back in.

646
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,152
As far as Nathan goes,

647
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:15,987
did you notice a personality
change in him?

648
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:17,155
Yes.

649
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:20,492
He always had a negative
answer to everything.

650
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:23,161
Nathan is very angry.

651
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:25,097
He's just so nasty.

652
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:32,204
Next, I came into your basement,
and I saw a depressed dead man.

653
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,539
He was in his late 50s,
early 60s.

654
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,941
It was kind of hard to tell.

655
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:37,609
It felt like he died here.

656
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,444
He died down here.

657
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:42,781
When I saw him
he had experienced

658
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,584
some kind of massive,
major loss,

659
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:47,819
and he was not
taking it well at all.

660
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:52,057
He was extremely distraught,
crying, depressed.

661
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,727
When I was around him I felt
anxiety, stress and chaos,

662
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:00,132
and it was kind of making me
feel a little crazy.

663
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm pretty sure I know
who she's talking about.

664
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:04,436
I want to tell you about this
guy named Anthony Ventamiglia.

665
00:31:04,438 --> 00:31:06,104
He was the first owner
of this house.

666
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:08,774
He and his mother lived here
for almost 30 years.

667
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:11,610
Now, Anthony's family had
a history of mental illness.

668
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,211
When he was little,
his dad was sent away

669
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,347
to an institution
and never came home.

670
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:16,982
He would wind up dying
in a mental hospital.

671
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:17,983
Wow.

672
00:31:17,985 --> 00:31:19,584
Shortly after moving here,

673
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,920
Anthony started
to go crazy himself.

674
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,623
I talked to a local P.I.,
and he told me in the '80s

675
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,291
Anthony used to go out
in the streets

676
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:27,592
here in his underwear
with a knife

677
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,262
and threaten anybody
that came near him.

678
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,497
Now, on November 14th, 1987,

679
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,567
Anthony hung himself
right here in the basement.

680
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,435
He was 70.

681
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,271
This is a copy of his death
certificate.

682
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:43,041
After hearing this, you pretty
sure it's this guy

683
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:45,510
Anthony?

684
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:46,812
Yes.

685
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:50,482
More than likely
we have his energy

686
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:54,286
as the initial baseline
that was absorbed by the house.

687
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,889
So you guys move into a house,
and so you're walking into that,

688
00:31:57,891 --> 00:32:00,258
and you're going to be
feeling that way.

689
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,698
Okay.
Anything else?

690
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,937
So the next person I encountered
was a deceased female

691
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:14,372
approximately 16 years of age.

692
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:17,342
When I encountered her,
side of her was, like, rotting

693
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:22,013
and, you know, kind of bony,
you know, like, decomposing.

694
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:25,350
And she was murdered,

695
00:32:25,352 --> 00:32:27,385
and she told me that
the reason why she's here

696
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:30,121
is because she's trying
to build a nest,

697
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:34,192
and her nest happens
to be in the closets.

698
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:38,697
She will lash out
when you guys disturb her.

699
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:42,100
She scratches people
when she gets irritated.

700
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:44,703
I went into the other closet
up here.

701
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:47,939
I opened that,
and she freaked the...out,

702
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:50,308
and she whooshed
into my eye

703
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,112
and out my head,
and it was ice-cold.

704
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:56,848
She's always watching, always
watching, always listening,

705
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,116
so I felt like the living here

706
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:01,119
may feel like they're
always being watched.

707
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:04,055
And I also heard her crying.

708
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,458
It was outside.
I heard her crying.

709
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,362
You may see her
as a small shadow figure.

710
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:11,763
Now, I didn't come
across a homicide

711
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,632
that fits that description
in my research,

712
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:16,234
but a lot of the experiences
you're talking about,

713
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:17,335
these guys are having.

714
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:19,271
I seen that shadow person
in the kitchen.

715
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,606
You've also heard
strange noises, right?

716
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,541
I've heard them out back
in the woods.

717
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,343
I've heard screaming
and yelling.

718
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,811
Yeah.

719
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:29,314
Now, Linda, you told me
about scratches you had.

720
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:33,418
I've woken up with scratches,
like, on my arm

721
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,422
or maybe on my neck,
Nathan, on his leg.

722
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:40,525
He would be scratched
in the shower.

723
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,761
So when you guys said that
you had been scratched

724
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,597
and also heard growling
and howling down in the house,

725
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,866
here, I had a pest
control expert come in to see

726
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,101
if some kind of wildlife
could have been doing that.

727
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,269
You know what?

728
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:52,504
He checked this place
from top to bottom,

729
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,205
and he gave this place
a clean bill of health.

730
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,375
He said he couldn't even find
evidence of mouse droppings.

731
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:59,744
Wow.

732
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,414
Amy, did you get
a good look at this girl?

733
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,883
I had a sketch done.

734
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,093
This is a little creepy?

735
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:22,667
My God.
It kinda looks like me.

736
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,539
This is creepy, knowing that
somebody can sit there

737
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,976
and reach out and grab you
as you're walking by the closet.

738
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:35,046
Yeah.
I don't like it.

739
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:38,616
So I walked into all three of
the bedrooms in the house,

740
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,952
and I saw some pretty
disturbing things.

741
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,787
When I went through
the front door

742
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,322
I went first
to the right.

743
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:46,157
That's Eric's room.
Eric's room.

744
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,493
Yeah. I got a photo of Eric,
right here.

745
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,495
Wow.
Wait a minute.

746
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:51,997
How old is he?

747
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:53,865
He'll be 31 in August.

748
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,701
I saw this person sweating
and freaking out.

749
00:34:56,703 --> 00:35:02,173
He was crying and he was,
basically, losing it,

750
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:04,976
and it just felt like everything
was closing in on him.

751
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,544
That sounds like Nathan.

752
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:07,879
Eric actually talked to me.

753
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,948
He told me he doesn't
experience anything, here.

754
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,182
You're his mom.

755
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:14,552
Is the crying and freaking
out sound like Eric?

756
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,054
No, no, no, no.
It doesn't.

757
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:18,256
That doesn't sound
like Eric at all.

758
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:19,391
It's a small house.

759
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,859
Is it possible you could
have been picking up

760
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,994
on Nathan's energy
in Eric's room?

761
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,295
Yeah.
It's a possibility.

762
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,064
Energy is energy,
and it's not always

763
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,566
just contained to one room.

764
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:33,405
So then I went into the bunk
bed room and, damn,

765
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,939
that room is active.

766
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:38,443
I saw a very strange
thing in there.

767
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:42,547
There was this long, like,
thing that slithers along,

768
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:45,350
goes onto the bunk
bed up on top.

769
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,286
It had, like, a clear,
jelly body.

770
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:51,156
So I think if somebody slept
on that top bunk, specifically,

771
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,624
I don't think
they'd get much sleep.

772
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:54,692
This is a lot of
uncomfortable energy.

773
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,628
I think they'd be
very irritated.

774
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,698
Okay. So, obviously,
Nathan's room, right?

775
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,133
Yeah.

776
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,002
Describe what Nathan told you
he sees in the room, there.

777
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:05,437
Yeah.

778
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:08,073
He said he sees something on
the floor that stares at him.

779
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:12,110
You know, kind of, just squats
and stares at him.

780
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:14,079
Eric has told me
he's heard him yell,

781
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:15,613
"Get away from me.
Leave me alone.

782
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:18,016
Just leave me alone,"
and then Eric will go by

783
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,451
and see him crying,

784
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:22,020
and just crying,
crying, crying.

785
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,254
Now, this is what's frustrating

786
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:24,889
about not being able
to talk to Nathan...

787
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,424
Yes.
Because he could have explained

788
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:27,659
to me what the hell this thing

789
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,094
really looked like to him.
Right.

790
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,128
I mean, what do you think
it looked like?

791
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,330
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

792
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:40,238
That's pretty messed up.

793
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:45,076
Holy...

794
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,312
That's awful.

795
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:49,681
My God.
No wonder he's freaked out.

796
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:52,183
Wow.

797
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,924
That's freaky, man.
I feel bad for the kid.

798
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,826
No wonder he's all...up.

799
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,606
That's freaky, man.
I feel bad for the kid.

800
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:33,474
No wonder he's all...up.

801
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:42,750
That must have been
what he saw, maybe,

802
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:46,087
squatting on the bottom
and staring at him?

803
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:50,291
Now, what I'm about to tell you
is extremely difficult.

804
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:54,095
Just listen, okay?

805
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:58,600
When I walked into
the master bedroom

806
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:01,869
I heard "dangerous telepath."

807
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,075
That's my room.

808
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,877
So am I in danger?

809
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,180
No.
What they're...

810
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:13,581
It means I'm
a dangerous telepath?

811
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,085
Yes.

812
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,553
What am I doing?

813
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:22,290
A lot of the haunting in this
house is coming from you.

814
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:24,792
You, inadvertently,
created this monster.

815
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:26,160
It's not real.

816
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:28,229
So this thing is made by Linda?

817
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:30,198
Yes.

818
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,967
And so I would say
maybe 50 percent

819
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:35,370
of what you're experiencing
is paranormal as far as,

820
00:38:35,372 --> 00:38:38,906
yeah, the girl is pissed off
and scratching people,

821
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:42,110
yeah, there's a dead guy
wandering around,

822
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:46,748
but 50 percent
is living-created.

823
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,817
I don't want to cause
any harm to anybody.

824
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:54,656
Now, here's the thing is that
telepaths typically develop

825
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:58,493
that ability when they're
young, when they're children.

826
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:02,630
So you developed that ability,
but you moved into this house,

827
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,967
and I think that's where
the problem really starts.

828
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,235
Okay.

829
00:39:07,237 --> 00:39:11,039
The residual energy is not
conducive to a person

830
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,975
with that type
of ability to be here.

831
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,910
And it starts with the crazy
guy that hung himself?

832
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,413
I believe so.

833
00:39:22,352 --> 00:39:25,853
Now, Linda, I know you've always
had the best of intentions,

834
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,121
but from what Amy is saying,

835
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,458
it sounds like you're
haunting your family,

836
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,927
and, honestly, I've never
heard anything like this

837
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:35,630
in all the years
I'm working with her.

838
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:37,865
Now we got to figure out
to fix this mess,

839
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:39,867
so for that I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

840
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:45,673
Okay. So you are dealing with
a lot of things, here.

841
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,944
You have a lot of negative
residual energy

842
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:53,081
that was placed here, I believe,
by the previous owner,

843
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,516
the individual
who killed himself.

844
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,252
So the first thing
that needs to be done

845
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:01,789
is the residual energy
needs to be removed.

846
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:03,658
The first thing that you
would need to do

847
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,830
is have a Reiki master come in
and cleanse the house,

848
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:10,198
and what they're
basically going to do

849
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,467
is remove the old
negative energy

850
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:15,770
and bring in positive energy.

851
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,305
As far as the dead girl
is concerned,

852
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:19,140
I'm going to take
her home with me.

853
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,008
I'm going to move her
on at home.

854
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,678
You got a freebie on that one.

855
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,381
Now, what about Linda
and her dangerous telepathy?

856
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,953
What I would like you to do is
Makko Ho exercises, stretches.

857
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:34,255
So its going to help you harness
and balance your energy

858
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:35,656
in a positive way.

859
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:37,458
So that will get rid of this
thing in his bedroom,

860
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,626
Nathan's bedroom?

861
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:40,628
Yes.

862
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,963
So once this is all done,

863
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:44,031
and if I do everything
and everything gets done,

864
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,366
will this house be okay?

865
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:46,667
Yeah.

866
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,336
It's like indescribable
how different it would be.

867
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:51,639
Your home will be
a completely different space.

868
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,741
You'll be a completely
different person.

869
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,042
You want to hold off
on that divorce,

870
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:56,878
or you want to do it anyway
and see what happens?

871
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,946
I can't answer that right now.

872
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:01,215
If I were you
I'd hold off on it.

873
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:05,820
You may be very different
in 6 months, is what I'm saying.

874
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:07,088
Yeah.
Give it some time.

875
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,589
Allow this healing to happen.

876
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,058
Allow your home to be
cleansed and renewed.

877
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,960
Now, Robie, you said you would
give her moral support.

878
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,796
What about cleaning up?
Would you help her with that?

879
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:17,465
Sure, I would.
All she's got to do is call.

880
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,567
She knows that.

881
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:21,869
I'll help her with anything
she needs help with, so.

882
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,108
I really hope Linda
contacts a Reiki master

883
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,645
to remove the negative
residual energy from her home

884
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,246
so she can focus on herself

885
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:35,283
and learn how to get
her abilities under control.

886
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,885
If she does that, the family
might finally be able

887
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,388
to find the peace
they've been hoping for.
