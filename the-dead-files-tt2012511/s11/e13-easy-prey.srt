1
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:13,011
It's all about revenge,

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,247
revenge against people.

3
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,419
I really think it's
going to kill one us.

4
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:24,022
He's going to hit somebody,
push somebody, scratch somebody.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,259
I have had scratches
from my neck

6
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,795
down to my back.

7
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,063
"I'll kill you.

8
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,665
I'll take you away
from everything you love."

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,002
I think this thing
wants me dead.

10
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,338
Their life source is being
sucked out of them,

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,206
and they're turning
into mummies.

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,443
This is not a good situation.

13
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,311
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,913
There's death here.

15
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,648
Don't wanna go down there.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,916
I see dead people.

17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,018
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,687
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,490
She's definitely
a serial killer.

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,292
...and they speak to me.

21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,461
She's going to torture them.

22
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,265
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

23
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,400
They were all murdered.

24
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,902
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,470
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,272
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

27
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,974
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

28
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,545
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:23,382
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

30
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,083
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,718
Who do you think
possessed you?

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,887
But Steve and I
never speak...

33
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,923
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,157
...until the very end.

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,792
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

36
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,861
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

37
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,362
<i>Hell,</i> no.

38
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,031
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,033
Everyone is in jeopardy.

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,115
I'm up here
in Grant Township, Michigan.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,218
It's about 70 miles north
of Detroit.

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,986
I got a call from a woman
named Rene.

43
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,121
Now, she and her husband
have been kicked,

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,123
scratched, choked...

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,125
You name it,
they've got through it.

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,094
She says it's tearing
her family apart,

47
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,996
and she desperately
needs our help.

48
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,100
Before Amy arrives,

49
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,569
I have to remove
any leading information.

50
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,005
This home has a lot
of antique portraits,

51
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,475
personal items,
and religious symbols,

52
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,311
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

53
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,748
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:46,965
The first thing is, like,
an earth, elemental thing.

55
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,934
It's angry and vengeful.

56
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,437
I think it's something that was
originally part of the Earth,

57
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,743
and then it split off
and is now just kind of evil.

58
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,147
It's all about revenge,

59
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,417
revenge against people.

60
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,827
So, Rene, when we were
talking on the phone, um,

61
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,429
it sounded like you were
going through hell here.

62
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,698
We are living in hell.

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,569
It's attacking myself,
my husband,

64
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,171
and if we don't get help
to reclaim our house,

65
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,773
reclaim our lives,

66
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:31,677
I really think it's gonna
kill one of us.

67
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,445
I believe it's evil.

68
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,713
How long have you lived
in the house?

69
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,348
Three and a half years.

70
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,284
My sister actually bought
the house for my husband and I

71
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,888
so the family could be
close together.

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,456
So, Rene, who lives
in the house?

73
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,991
It's me, my husband,

74
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,927
and a family friend
lives with us also.

75
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,796
Is everybody in the house
being affected?

76
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,565
Everybody in the house
is being affected,

77
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,503
but it seems to be mostly
directed at my husband.

78
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,671
So why do you think that is?

79
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,508
Because Edward had
a really rough childhood,

80
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,380
and he's vulnerable
because he's bipolar.

81
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,549
If you can, give me a list
of what's going on here.

82
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,985
Well, we hear voices.

83
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,487
We're seeing shadow figures,

84
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,957
and we've been having
physical attacks,

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,293
and our health is declining.

86
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,128
What's the worst
health issue for you?

87
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,230
Complete lethargy,

88
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,199
like someone's
just taken my energy

89
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,234
and wants to live off
what I have.

90
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,937
All right, so what do you think
whatever's in this house wants?

91
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,541
I think it just wants
to kill, destroy.

92
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,212
Tell me how
I can fight and win.

93
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,447
I want to win.

94
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,450
There's
this one person here,

95
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,685
a dead dude,

96
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,656
who's psycho
and causing problems.

97
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,325
He looks like a preacher
or a pastor.

98
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,694
He's really bad.

99
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,430
He says, "I'm gonna kill you,
and I'm gonna make you

100
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,099
"...feel the pain of, like,

101
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,803
saying goodbye
to all of your loved ones."

102
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,045
So, Rene, I know you're worried
about your husband Edward,

103
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,212
but what about you?

104
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,547
What experiences are
you having?

105
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,684
Things break here
all the time,

106
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,720
and there's no explanation.

107
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,754
Now, you got animals
in the house.

108
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,056
Are you sure
it wasn't them?

109
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,460
This was happening before
we even got the animals.

110
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,062
Okay. Anything else?

111
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:34,766
Well, my animals have died
without explanation.

112
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,835
So obviously, like me,
you're an animal lover.

113
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,170
What do you have here?

114
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:42,074
We have dogs. We have cats.
We have chickens.

115
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:46,078
We have a couple pigs,
a sheep, and goats.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,316
If we show any kind of love,

117
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,419
- this house, it -- it...
- it will know.

118
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,890
- It will be dead.
- I'm sorry.

119
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,626
That's okay.

120
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,161
Okay. Anything else?

121
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:07,132
Well, I seen a shadow man
walk across the kitchen.

122
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,701
Is it something that has a shape
to it, or is it just...

123
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,637
He has a shape
like Abraham Lincoln.

124
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,241
How often do you see this?

125
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,810
We all see it quite a bit.

126
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,146
All this stuff going on,
how are you dealing with it?

127
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,981
People
don't really understand.

128
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,184
And you're supposed
to be safe in your house.

129
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,688
It's supposed
to be your comfort zone.

130
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,294
Come here. You'll be all right.
Don't worry about it.

131
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,030
- We'll fix this, okay?
- Okay.

132
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,304
I'm seeing
a shadow figure in there.

133
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,140
I think it's the pastor dude.

134
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:51,343
I think the living see him
as a shadow,

135
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,611
so he's like,

136
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,980
"I want to show you.
Like, look a what I can do.

137
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:59,017
"I can be, you know, project
these images and...with people."

138
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,120
He's reading their minds.
This is what scares them.

139
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,990
Like, he's even, like,
like, challenging me.

140
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,859
"I'll kill you. I'll take you
away from everything you love."

141
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,567
Okay, Rene, so what's
going on up here?

142
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,536
I've seen an apparition
of a woman

143
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,738
sitting on my bed
right there,

144
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,674
and she just sat down...

145
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,742
On the edge here?

146
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:29,047
...right here,
and just stared at me.

147
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,717
Her hair was
in a disheveled bun,

148
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,388
but she had huge teeth.

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,756
All right. So anything else?

150
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,193
I sometimes get the sensation
as if I'm being choked.

151
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,261
Okay. So can you
describe it for me?

152
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,898
It's like somebody
is taking their fingers

153
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,934
and shoving them
down my throat.

154
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,269
Anything else physical like that
ever happened to you?

155
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,437
Yes.

156
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,840
There have been a couple
of times that I woke up,

157
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,810
and when I woke up, I felt as
if I'd been punched in the face.

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
So I gotta ask, how the hell
are you sleeping

159
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,349
with all of this going on?
- Well, I barely sleep.

160
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,884
When I do lay down to sleep,

161
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,955
I'm just overwhelmed with
all kinds of negative thoughts.

162
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,157
Me being hurt in car cashes.

163
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,793
People leaving me, and people
saying that they hate me,

164
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,929
just feeling abandoned
all the time.

165
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,397
What the hell
you still doing here?

166
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,634
Well, I believe my God is
stronger, so I'm gonna fight.

167
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,737
I won't let it get to the point
where it kills my husband.

168
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,473
- Okay.
- I know that Jesus can win.

169
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,208
I know Amy can win.

170
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,780
It's not good up here.
Mnh-mnh, no.

171
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,215
It's really bad up here.

172
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,984
I don't know how...any living
person would come up here.

173
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,356
The pastor, this is his area.

174
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,825
The living people here,
I think he tortures them.

175
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,093
How?

176
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,229
With nightmares, going, like,
into their dreams.

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,369
He is literally
in their mind, doing this.

178
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:02,874
I think that
he would be capable of...

179
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,844
harming living people up here.

180
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,913
If he's gonna do anything,
he's gonna hit somebody,

181
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,915
push somebody, scratch somebody.

182
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,418
You know what I'm saying?
So this is not good.

183
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,925
So, Patricia, I understand
you're Rene's sister,

184
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,361
and you actually bought this
house for her and Edward, right?

185
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,528
Yes.

186
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,431
I feel really guilty
because I brought them

187
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,400
to a place where it's dark.

188
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,435
So what about you, Patricia?
Any experiences?

189
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,137
- Yes.
- Okay.

190
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,341
In the hallway,
I saw a shadow figure,

191
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,909
and I thought it was Eddie,

192
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,212
but come to find out,
he was sound asleep in the bed,

193
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,547
and there was nobody
in the hallway.

194
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,549
Talking to Rene, she's pretty
convinced that whatever is here

195
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,251
is trying to kill
or really hurt Edward.

196
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,186
- Do you agree with that?
- Yeah.

197
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,855
Eddie is very vulnerable,

198
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,759
and his history with
his family is horrific.

199
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,394
It attacks the vulnerable.

200
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:19,300
This pastor is like, "I can
do this. This is my domain.

201
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,568
I can do this."

202
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,903
You know, he's like,
"I can be everywhere,

203
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,339
and I can be nowhere,"
and I do think he can.

204
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,977
He goes, "I see their fears."

205
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,678
This shadow person
that I saw here,

206
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,749
sitting here, it looked like,
almost like a man.

207
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,018
It's something familiar
to the living people here.

208
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,021
That it would be like...
"That's so-and-so,"

209
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:44,592
and somehow slightly familiar
where it's disturbing.

210
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,262
He likes to...
twist that knife.

211
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,468
So, Edward, I was talking
to your wife, Rene,

212
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,803
and she was telling me

213
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,271
that she thinks you're,
like, the target here.

214
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,240
- I mean, do you agree with that?
- Yes, I do.

215
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:04,212
I think that whatever is here
is focusing in on me.

216
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,047
So tell me
about your experiences.

217
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,749
What have you had?

218
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,718
I've seen shadow figures
in our bathroom,

219
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,954
blocked out the window
for half a second,

220
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:16,024
and I thought, "What
in the world was that?"

221
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:17,959
Sure it couldn't have been
maybe a car going by

222
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,527
or somebody walking
along the road?

223
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:21,796
No. No way.

224
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,531
Our windows are very high up,

225
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,201
so it's not like
it was somebody outside

226
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,769
that had passed the window.

227
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,471
Okay.
What else is going on?

228
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:32,040
I have been
physically attacked.

229
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,343
I have had scratches
from my neck down

230
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,278
to my back and bruises.

231
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,880
What kind of bruises?

232
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:42,550
I would wake up, on my legs,
big bruises,

233
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,553
and not have a clue
as to where they come from.

234
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,856
Gone to the doctor's
about this?
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,458
And he says,
"You're healthy as a horse."

236
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,360
Anything else going on
as far as physical attacks?

237
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:56,264
One time, I was walking
through my kitchen.

238
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,067
It felt like I got
kicked in the stomach,

239
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:03,905
and I flew back about 15 feet
and hit my head on the table,

240
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:07,108
and just about
knocked myself out.

241
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,443
You could've been killed.

242
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:10,845
I'm afraid for my life
in this house.

243
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:13,481
I feel very confined,
just, like,

244
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,651
something is just
around me all the time

245
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,087
and won't leave me.

246
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:21,589
This pastor,

247
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:24,292
now he's showing me
more the image of him --

248
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,427
cape, hat,

249
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,463
very tall,

250
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:31,866
covering the, lights,

251
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,801
end of the hall.

252
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,238
So I'm thinking that
this is an image

253
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,174
that this person would see.

254
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,912
This living person feels
trapped by

255
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,214
this -- this presence.

256
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:49,918
Interesting that as soon as
I try to tap the living here,

257
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm having issues.

258
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,558
Something important out there.

259
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,993
They don't want me to see it.

260
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:02,263
I feel like it's still, like,
a living person

261
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,199
that doesn't want me to...

262
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,570
deal with that
or see that or something.

263
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,572
This is something personal,

264
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,440
something they're
connected with.

265
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:15,276
It's something they
don't want...

266
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,278
Maybe their emotional issues.

267
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,983
Rene explained that you had
some mental issues

268
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,385
from a tough childhood.
- Yeah.

269
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,188
My mother
was clinically insane.

270
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,224
I was put in the orphanage
at the age of 1.

271
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,861
I didn't get adopted
until I was 9 years old.

272
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:36,564
My father,
he murdered my brothers.

273
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:43,871
They were 23 months old,
started the house on fire.

274
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:46,808
You're breaking my heart,
listening to this story.

275
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,377
Do you think because of
your traumatic background

276
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,579
that you're vulnerable?

277
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,514
Yes, I do,

278
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:57,318
and I think this thing
attacks the vulnerable.

279
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,088
So would you say that
your mental state

280
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,223
has really deteriorated more
since you moved in here?

281
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,659
- Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay.

282
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,429
It makes me sick.

283
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,099
This house -- I've gotten,
just for no reason,

284
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,368
I'll run to the bathroom
and get sick.

285
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,269
What do you think
whatever here wants?

286
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,740
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

287
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:21,042
I think this thing
wants me dead.

288
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:27,582
This elemental thing
I saw earlier is bad news.

289
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:32,820
It makes people sick
and it makes people angry.

290
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:37,525
Damn. And it -- it --
it causes, um, anxiety.

291
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:40,495
That thing makes them
more vulnerable.

292
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:43,064
It wants to kill
a living person here.

293
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,066
One thing it kept
showing me was, like,

294
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:48,403
sacrificing someone
in the house.

295
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:04,926
So my old friend and author
T.J. Gaffney called me

296
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,261
when he heard I was in town

297
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:08,430
investigating
Rene and Edward's house.

298
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,065
Now he did some digging for me

299
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,968
and says one of the original
owners of the property

300
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,405
had nothing but years
of death and bad luck.

301
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,078
Well, T.J., it's good
to see you again.

302
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,380
You mentioned on the phone that
this Balmer family had nothing

303
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,549
but bad luck when they got
on my clients' property,

304
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,284
but before we get to that,
who are these people,

305
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,652
and when did they get there?

306
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,721
Well, Alexander Balmer
is a Scottish immigrant

307
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,090
who moves to the area
in 1851.

308
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,458
Okay.

309
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,628
He buys 80 acres that includes
your clients' property,

310
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,464
and they move into
and build a log cabin,

311
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,633
just like the one
we see over here,

312
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:49,037
with his wife Isabella
and 12 kids.

313
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,473
- In -- in a cabin that size?
- In a cabin that size.

314
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,175
What do they do
with the property?

315
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,377
Well, he's a farmer,
and as you know, back then,

316
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,012
farming was a tough life.

317
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:01,783
Alexander passes away in 1887
at the age of 84,

318
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,820
and it all starts to go
downhill from there.

319
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:06,421
What happens with the farm?

320
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,590
Well, it passes
to his son Andrew.

321
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,425
And how does it go for him?

322
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,827
Well, not well.

323
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,797
About 3 years later, his mom
passes away on the farm as well.

324
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,966
Okay, so do we know
what she dies from?

325
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,401
Unfortunately not.

326
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,970
There's no death record
that we've been able to find.

327
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,672
He's got the property.

328
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,907
Both the parents are gone,
so it's his free and clear.

329
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,409
Well, not totally.

330
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,145
He's got three spinster sisters
he's got to take care of.

331
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:32,380
It's so bad for him
that he never marries,

332
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,683
never gets to start
a family of his own.

333
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:42,524
I'm getting
so much loss and sadness.

334
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:45,494
I saw bunches of dead bodies.

335
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:52,434
I think it has something to do
with this elemental thing.

336
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,768
What does it look like?

337
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,538
Like a cross between

338
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,274
an insect, a snake,

339
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:02,711
and a tree.

340
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:05,347
I think it doesn't like
living people.

341
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,715
The other thing
it showed me is that

342
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,150
it can make minis of itself,

343
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:14,222
and these smaller beings can
be dispatched to do...

344
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,924
bad things,

345
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,894
I'm thinking to the living,
to make them leave.

346
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,498
All right.

347
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,100
So Andrew is there with his
three spinster sisters,

348
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,469
and he's got the farm.
I mean, what happens now?

349
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,804
Well, in 1913, we get
one of the biggest storms

350
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,741
to ever hit the state.
- Okay.

351
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:36,444
It was so devastating that
the farm never really recovers.

352
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,046
So what happens after that?

353
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,748
Well, one of
the sisters, Janet,

354
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,652
ends up passing later that year
of an abdominal aneurysm.

355
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:44,920
All right,
says here she was 71.

356
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,255
- Did she die on the property?
- Yes.

357
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,523
What happens with
the other two sisters?

358
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,993
Isabell ends up passing away
3 years after that.

359
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:55,797
She ends up dying from,
an intestinal cancer,

360
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,166
and again, she passes away
on the property.

361
00:17:58,168 --> 00:17:59,434
Okay, so there's
one sister left.

362
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,802
Does he just cut his losses

363
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:03,371
and sell the property
with his sister and move on?

364
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,474
Nope. He stays on the property
right until the end of his life,

365
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:10,645
passes away in 1928 from
pneumonia, also on the property.

366
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:11,813
You weren't kidding
when you said

367
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:13,315
their family had
a lot of bad luck.

368
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,482
It seems like every time,
you know,

369
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:15,650
they started to get ahead

370
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,386
or were moving
in a positive direction,

371
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,455
something negative
happens to 'em.

372
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,128
The elemental thing lives
in this tree.

373
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,497
It's impacting
the living directly.

374
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,565
How?

375
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,668
I hear, "Break things.
Make it hard."

376
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,604
Things will go horribly wrong,

377
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:38,239
like, you know,
the sewer system went.

378
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,875
Not only did that happen,
but also the car broke.

379
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:46,081
And not only did that happen,
but also all the TVs exploded.

380
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,651
It's obviously impeding
their lives. It's that bad.

381
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:50,986
Why is it doing this?

382
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,355
It's saying that the living
started this,

383
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:56,157
and now it's acting on...

384
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,693
this revenge.

385
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,831
So before
I even got into town,

386
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,499
I reached out to
a local genealogist

387
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,701
and had him start looking
for the property's history.

388
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:10,805
Now, he just called back
and said, "In the last 50 years,

389
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,308
"four people have died
on Rene and Edward's property,

390
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,011
and two of 'em, way too young."

391
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,550
Well, Walt, it's good
to see you again.

392
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,386
You mentioned on the phone
there were four deaths

393
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,788
in about 50 years in connection
with my clients' property.

394
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,823
- Yes.
- What's the first one?

395
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,826
Well, it was a young couple,
John and Barbara Grimm.

396
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:34,763
They bought
the property in 1963.

397
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:40,602
Tragically, in 1967, Barbara was
diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

398
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:44,139
Two weeks after the diagnosis,
she died in the hospital.

399
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,741
She was only 43 years old.

400
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,476
Okay, so what happened
to the husband?

401
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,812
He started drinking heavily,

402
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:56,351
and five years after her death,
in 1972, he sold the property.

403
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,620
Three years after that,
tragically,

404
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:01,089
he died of
cirrhosis of the liver.

405
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,191
He was only 55 years old.

406
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,993
So that's two
pretty young, sad deaths.

407
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,261
What about the other two?

408
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:09,030
The third death was a homemaker,
Marguerite Girardi.

409
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:14,302
She died in 1999 of
a heart attack on the property.

410
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:17,505
She was 67 years old.

411
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,240
All right.
So what about the fourth one?

412
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:21,476
The fourth was
a World War II veteran,

413
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:22,977
Chester Ulrich.

414
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:26,081
He had bought
the property in 2002,

415
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,883
and three months later,
he died.

416
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:31,052
He'd also died
of a heart attack.

417
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,421
You know, Walt, I just talked to
another guy a little while ago,

418
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:34,823
and he told me
about five deaths

419
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,391
associated with
the Balmer family

420
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:37,826
that used to live
on the property,

421
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,694
and with this four,
that makes nine.

422
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,197
- That's a lot.
- I agree.

423
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:48,703
A lot of whatever
it's doing now is revenge.

424
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,673
What does this elemental
thing do to the living?

425
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:54,709
It gets its energy from
the living,

426
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,545
like, energy vampire
kind of thing, I think.

427
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:02,250
So how would the living
be affected?

428
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,720
It would drain them.
It makes people sick.

429
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,790
Their life source, like,
is being sucked out of them,

430
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,458
and they're turning
into mummies.

431
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,595
It's almost like the person's,
like, dehydrating

432
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,597
and, like, starving to death,

433
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,600
so then it would affect living
people's organs after a while,

434
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:21,736
so, like, kidney function,
neurological,

435
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,404
like, issues, okay?

436
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,407
I feel like I was having
a heart attack.

437
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:29,344
After a while of consistently
being exposed to this thing,

438
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:31,446
the body's not able
to stabilize itself.

439
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:34,015
The body shuts down.
People die.

440
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,024
For more information
about the show,

441
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,659
and if you need us
to investigate

442
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,394
unexplained activity
in your home...

443
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:49,931

and we'll help if we can.

446
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,860
So far, I've got clients
being physically attacked

447
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:06,197
on a property connected
to nine deaths,

448
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,833
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

449
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:11,869
Searching through old records,
I come across a gruesome murder

450
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:15,173
where a husband bludgeoned
his wife to death.

451
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,642
Turns out, the homicide
took place less than a mile

452
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:19,477
from Rene and Edward's property.

453
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,712
I'm meeting a local historian

454
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,947
who says the story
of this murder is so crazy,

455
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,616
it could be made into a movie.

456
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,122
Well, Chris, thanks
for meeting with me.

457
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:32,490
I appreciate it.

458
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,559
This crazy murder you talked
about to me on the phone,

459
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,928
before we get to it, what do
we know about the perpetrator?

460
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,030
Well, his name is
Elmer Smith.

461
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:41,766
He had a 208-acre farm
about 3/4 mile

462
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:43,234
from where you guys are
investigating.

463
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,236
He's got a psycho look
on his face.

464
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,071
You think that's bad,
wait until you see his wife.

465
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:48,139
Really?

466
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:51,175
In 1937, Elmer marries
Helen Forrest.

467
00:22:51,177 --> 00:22:53,311
She moves on the farm
right away.

468
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,013
As soon as she moved
on the property,

469
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,482
the two began
to fight constantly.

470
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:59,050
Now they're only married
not even a year,

471
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:02,420
and she's already
filing for divorce.

472
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,921
Now, Chris, take me
to the day of the murder.

473
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,189
What happened?

474
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:08,192
Well, on Thanksgiving night,
November 24, 1938,

475
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:11,162
it all kind of came to a head
when a huge argument broke out

476
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:12,997
between them
about how the farm

477
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,966
was gonna be settled
in the divorce.

478
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:16,968
The argument raised to the point
where she comes at him

479
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,438
with a kitchen knife, screaming,
"I've got murder in my heart!"

480
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,373
Okay.

481
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,208
Well, he picks up a piece
of wood from the stove,

482
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,010
hits her upside
of the head with it,

483
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:28,112
and murders her.

484
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:29,347
Does he confess?

485
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:31,349
Well, not right away.
He panics.

486
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:34,218
He takes the piece of wood,
her clothing, and burns it.

487
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,121
Then he takes the body,
puts it in a large burlap bag,

488
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,656
takes it to the back end
of the farm,

489
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,958
and drops it
in an abandoned well.

490
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,827
So obviously,
he gets arrested,

491
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,128
so they must have
found the body.

492
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,798
- What happened?
- Well, he cracks under pressure,

493
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
and he admits to the whole
thing to the sheriff,

494
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,436
and tells them
where the body is at.

495
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:53,871
Okay, so now, Chris,
does he plead out

496
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:55,540
or does he go to trial?

497
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,975
There's a 2-week-long
jury trial.

498
00:23:57,977 --> 00:23:59,677
Okay, so what happened?
He gets convicted?

499
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,546
The jury acquits him
of the murder.

500
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:02,747
They acquit him?

501
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,749
The minister
of the Methodist church

502
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:06,484
that he attended
testified that

503
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,753
he was a religious man
and well-respected,

504
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:11,622
a mild-mannered individual
who attended church regularly

505
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,124
until the time of the murder.

506
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:16,160
- So now, he's acquitted.
- Yes.

507
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,428
Does he stay on the property,
get married again?

508
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,629
What happens to this guy?

509
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,832
As far as I know,
he stays on the property,

510
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,434
and he lives to the ripe
old age of 72 years old,

511
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:25,737
passing away in 1955.

512
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:27,505
There's his death certificate.

513
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,540
He wind up getting away
with murder.

514
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,808
You're right.

515
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,578
This could be made into
a movie of the week.

516
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,215
I'm trying to get more on
who this pastor guy was in life.

517
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:40,852
He's got the Bible in his left
hand, and he wears this outfit,

518
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,220
you know, like the pastors
used to wear

519
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:44,322
with the big black hat
and the black suit.

520
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:45,757
Do you get any time period?

521
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,128
I'm gonna place him
in 1940 or on.

522
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,330
Do you know if he has
some connection to the property?

523
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:55,266
I feel like there was
a different structure,

524
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:58,069
but he is associating
himself with this place.

525
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,537
I don't know why, yet.

526
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,039
I don't know, so I guess,
he's, like, a psychopath.

527
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,781
And there's another
dead person here.

528
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,416
It's a female.

529
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,918
It's, I think, like,
maybe a wife?

530
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,787
It feels like they might
have been married,

531
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,790
but it wouldn't have been
a real marriage.

532
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,160
I don't know how this person
who died in here died,

533
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:23,928
but it was not good,
and I'm freaking out

534
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,731
because it was, like,
a struggle.

535
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:30,735
He's yelling at her.

536
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,438
I could say he was abusive.

537
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,208
I'm seeing him throw
this chick out, outside.

538
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:41,813
Something about the floors...
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

539
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:43,114
He's like, "I keep trying
to clean 'em,

540
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,382
"and I can't get 'em clean.

541
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:46,284
I can't get 'em clean.
I can't get 'em clean."

542
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:47,819
I think he killed her.

543
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,253
Boom. Done.

544
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:59,864
I saw a lot of disturbing
things during my walk,

545
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,899
but two stood out.

546
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:04,802
First, the vengeful creature
I saw outside.

547
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:08,372
He has created himself
in the image of the tree,

548
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:11,242
so his skin takes
on the bark appearance.

549
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,510
All right.

550
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:14,912
His face is
more insect-looking.

551
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:17,181
There's no nose or mouth
or anything,

552
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:20,284
and it's kind of
a V-shaped.

553
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:23,821
Next, I described
the angry pastor.

554
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,656
He has the black jacket

555
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:28,559
and a white,
buttoned-up shirt.

556
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:32,330
It's got
that wide-brimmed hat.

557
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:34,699
Looks like he's been,
like, beat up.

558
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,672
Amy, is this who you saw?

559
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes.

560
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,355
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

561
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,457
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

562
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,993
and our clients
for the first time.

563
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,129
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Rene and her husband Edward.

564
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,565
Now we're sitting here,
so obviously,

565
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,233
the activity
in this place is bad.

566
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,070
In fact, Rene told me
it's tearing their family apart.

567
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,471
But the real reason
she called us in

568
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,873
is because she thinks
that whatever is here is deadly,

569
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,276
and she's convinced
it's going after Edward.

570
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,345
So now I've introduced
Amy to you guys,

571
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,180
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk with us.

572
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:37,087
Interestingly enough,
on this particular walk,

573
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:42,025
a living person actually
put a little bit of a block up

574
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:46,596
so that I couldn't get a lot
of, like, personal things.

575
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,934
I got that this person has
a lot of emotional issues

576
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,804
that they don't want
to deal with or discuss.

577
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,840
So you know I told you
how Rene thinks

578
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,775
Edward's the target, right?
- Right.

579
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,110
Well, she also thinks

580
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,612
it's because Edward's got
some emotional problems.

581
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,514
Okay.

582
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:09,753
My father murdered
my two brothers in a fire.

583
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:13,890
I spent 81/2 years
in an orphanage.

584
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,127
It has been a struggle.

585
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:21,064
It feels like the world
is on top of me.

586
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,667
Amy, do you think Edward
is the person that blocked you?

587
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,069
It's possible.

588
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,372
It's something that you might
be doing inadvertently

589
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,775
as a protection measure
for yourself.

590
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,813
What else was going on?

591
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,749
One of the things
that I saw during my walk

592
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,585
was a deceased female,

593
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:46,122
and I saw her in
the upstairs bedroom,

594
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,757
the very back one.

595
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,325
That's their bedroom.

596
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,162
She was going through
extreme despair,

597
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:56,633
and also, I think if anybody
was even slightly sensitive,

598
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,569
they would occasionally
see her.

599
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,840
So, Rene, you told me about
the woman you saw in your bed.

600
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,542
Tell Amy about that.

601
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,911
She turned and looked at me,

602
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,047
and had these, like,
piranha teeth,

603
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,417
and then
she just faded away.

604
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,686
You get any idea who this woman
might have been?

605
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,656
I believe that she was
the wife of a dead male

606
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,358
that is in this house.

607
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,295
I was able to get a lot more
on him than her.

608
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,163
This is not a good guy.

609
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,700
I got that he was from
probably around 1940,

610
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,803
and he kept showing me
a different structure,

611
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,971
but for some reason,

612
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,074
he was associating himself
with this place.

613
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,478
He was wearing a black suit,
round, black hat.

614
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,581
His dress reminded me
of a pastor's dress,

615
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,150
and he kind of claimed
to be a man of God.

616
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,018
And then I got that
at some point,

617
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,255
he changed direction
in his life.

618
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,958
He's extremely angry,
very abusive,

619
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
had some serious issues
with his wife.

620
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,928
It didn't feel like
a real marriage.

621
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,397
I saw them fighting
in the back room.

622
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,466
I saw her falling
to the ground.

623
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,703
I saw him throwing her out
of the door and yelling at her.

624
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:09,038
The woman kept saying,
"I want to die. I want to die."

625
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,443
And then I saw the man trying
to clean the floors inside,

626
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,745
and then he was screaming
at me to get out.

627
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,980
Like, he didn't want me
to see

628
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,483
what the hell
was going on there.

629
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,585
That's pretty interesting stuff
she's just talking about...
Wow.

630
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,254
because she reminds me
of a homicide

631
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,258
I came across in my research
that happened about 3/4-mile

632
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,227
from where your house is.

633
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,230
Perp was a guy named
Elmer Smith. He was 55.

634
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:38,568
In 1937, Smith married
a woman named Helen Forrest.

635
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,003
Now as soon as she moved there,

636
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,238
they started fighting
like cats and dogs,

637
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,439
and after less then a year,

638
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,475
Helen told Elmer
she wanted a divorce.

639
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,178
On Thanksgiving night,
November 24, 1938,

640
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,648
Elmer and Helen
had a horrible fight.

641
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,350
Things got violent,
and Helen grabbed a knife.

642
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,519
Elmer grabs
a piece of firewood...

643
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,256
...and bashes her brain in
and kills her.

644
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,491
The guy you saw
was cleaning the floor

645
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,227
and trying to hide something
from you, right?

646
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,496
Yeah.
Elmer tried to cover up
the homicide.

647
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,966
He took Helen's clothes
and the wood

648
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,701
that he bashed her brains in
with, and he burned it.

649
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,002
No.

650
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,005
Then he put Helen's body
into a burlap bag

651
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,475
and basically dumped it down
an old well on the property.

652
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,413
In March of 1939,
he got acquitted by a jury.

653
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,782
Turns out, he was very
well-liked in the community.

654
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,517
In fact,
the local Methodist minister

655
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,586
spoke on Elmer's behalf.

656
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,154
Now, Amy,
you said the guy you saw

657
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,056
was a man of God
until they went crazy.

658
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,091
Well, the minister said in court

659
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:39,495
that Elmer was in church every
week up until the homicide,

660
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,164
then he stopped going.

661
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:45,034
Now I was able to track down
a photo of Elmer.

662
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,771
He's a real peachy-looking
type of guy.

663
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,040
Is it possible Elmer's
the guy you saw?

664
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,976
I had a sketch done.

665
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,486
This guy's creepy looking.

666
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,223
You guys take a look.

667
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,693
- Wow.
- I can see it.

668
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,764
Mouth's perfectly the same.

669
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,067
The nose is perfectly the same.

670
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,536
It's him.

671
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,439
So does this pastor guy
do anything to these two?

672
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,241
I think
there's a couple of ways

673
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,212
that you would be able
to interact with him.

674
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:32,615
You would see him,
more than likely

675
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,819
as an apparition
or shadowy figure

676
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,588
with his hat.

677
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:45,662
Sometimes, we will see
a tall shadow figure

678
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,498
with a hat.

679
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,600
One of the things that he was
very proud of is that

680
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,468
he can go inside
of your minds

681
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,772
while you're asleep
and enter your dreams,

682
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,074
and he can manipulate them,

683
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:03,312
so I would assume that you would
have serious sleep issues.

684
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,015
When I'm trying to
go to bed,

685
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,785
the thoughts will start
flying through my head,

686
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:12,422
just terrible things
of car crashes,

687
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,357
and I've actually
heard in my head,

688
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,793
"You know, you really should
kill yourself

689
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,529
and do them a favor."

690
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,664
The thing that
concerned me the most

691
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,802
is that he could potentially
get physical with the living,

692
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,005
and what I got was
specifically pushing,

693
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,973
punching, and scratching.

694
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:36,679
I woke up and have felt that
I've been punched in the face.

695
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,948
You also get the feeling
of being choked, right?

696
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,116
Yes.

697
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,453
I mean, like, the finger
down the throat.

698
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,587
Wow.

699
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,955
Edward, do me a favor,
and tell Amy about

700
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,557
when you got attacked
in the kitchen.

701
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:51,227
I got kicked violently
in the chest.

702
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,863
I flew back, hit my head.

703
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,234
And it totally
knocked me stupid.

704
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,204
This is all being caused
by this pastor guy?

705
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,073
- Yeah.
- I'm frightened.

706
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,645
The next thing I saw
is a huge problem

707
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,048
and has me very concerned.

708
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,751
So what I ran into outside

709
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,019
is what's called
an earth elemental.

710
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,723
So this is being that was
originally part of the Earth,

711
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,025
but something
caused this thing

712
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:27,196
to separate itself
from the Earth,

713
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,900
and it became its own
conscious entity.

714
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,369
I think that this thing,
more than likely,

715
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,539
has affected every person
who's ever lived here,

716
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,307
and what it likes to do

717
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,145
is create hardships
in people's lives.

718
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,848
And in some
very extreme cases,

719
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,084
it could cause death.

720
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,753
I did see a lot of
dead bodies during my walk,

721
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,456
and I think they might
be from this thing.

722
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,958
There have been a lot of deaths
on the property over the years,

723
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,160
but individually,

724
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,595
none of them are
that shocking to me.

725
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,430
But the sheer number of
the people who have died here

726
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,099
is what stands out to me.

727
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,667
I'll take the Balmer family.

728
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,503
They bought this property
back in 1851.

729
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,573
Now, five of them died
right here on the property.

730
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,675
I've got
their death certificates.

731
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,811
It's just a whole bunch of 'em.

732
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,445
So I had
a local genealogist look into

733
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,147
the more recent deaths
on your property,

734
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,683
and he came up
with four in 50 years.

735
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,451
- So I got...
- Wow.

736
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,953
...another bunch
of death certificates

737
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,588
to go with the property.

738
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,924
And the causes of death
cover the spectrum.

739
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,425
I mean, we're talking
heart attacks,

740
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,695
abdominal problems,
intestinal cancer, you name it.

741
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,598
Now, is this elemental thing
possibly the reason

742
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,234
for the deaths
you're talking about?

743
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,703
It could've caused
some of 'em.

744
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,905
Could people see this elemental?
What does it look like?

745
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,341
I did have a sketch
of what I saw.

746
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,684
The hell is this?

747
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,788
Wow.

748
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,958
This thing's alive?

749
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,127
In a way.

750
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,864
Does this thing live
in the tree in the backyard?

751
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,601
So why don't we just go outside,
cut it down, and get rid of it?

752
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,803
No.

753
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,404
Why not?

754
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,574
Well, it'll just go to another
tree, or it'll go in the Earth.

755
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,142
When he's collected
enough energy,

756
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:24,013
he can break off into
little miniatures of himself,

757
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,282
and these are
the parts of him

758
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,753
that are able to
create chaos in your lives,

759
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,488
and so kind of
what I got was that,

760
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,558
all of a sudden,
everything will break down.

761
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,059
Your car will break
down one day.

762
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:40,563
The next day, it'll be
your A/C, which is not good.

763
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm so tired of living like this
because now I'm right back to,

764
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,369
"My gosh,
the car is broke now.

765
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,638
"The freezer
is full of maggots.

766
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,573
"The dishwasher broke,

767
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:54,377
and the sink in the bathroom
broke today."

768
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,713
The other way
that it can harm you is,

769
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,984
when it cut itself off
from the Earth directly,

770
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,754
it lost its source of food,

771
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,491
and now what it has to do
is feed off of living organisms,

772
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:14,463
specifically living people
and occasionally animals.

773
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,767
So, Rene, can you tell Amy
about the animals,

774
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,802
situations going on with them?

775
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,171
They die mysteriously.

776
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:27,476
We don't understand
what or how they die.

777
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,246
So, Rene, can you do me a favor,
and tell Amy

778
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,115
how you feel drained
all the time in the house?

779
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:38,054
Yeah, absolutely.
No energy whatsoever.

780
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,490
I'll get up after
sleeping 12 hours,

781
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:47,530
and within three hours,
I'm back in bed.

782
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:52,001
Long-term exposure to
this thing can lead to death.

783
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,570
I saw very specifically
organ-function issues,

784
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,739
liver, kidneys, your heart,

785
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,507
so that's why
some of these deaths

786
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,811
may have been caused by it,
you know,

787
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,181
especially people who are
already compromised.

788
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,983
Your health has declined
since you've moved to the house.

789
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:11,387
Yes. I just feel like
it's attacking me personally,

790
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:16,392
physically and mentally
and emotionally.

791
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,827
All right.
So what does this thing want?

792
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:22,031
It blames living people
for ruining its land.

793
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,934
It actually became
fueled by revenge,

794
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:28,237
and it's trying to stop
at nothing to get you to leave.

795
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,807
If you stayed here long enough,
it would suck you dry.

796
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,543
- It is, yeah.
- That's exactly what we say.

797
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,878
And it's, "My gosh,

798
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,080
is the light being sucked
out of us?"

799
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,815
Are they in a lot of danger?

800
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,417
Yeah. Yeah.

801
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,155
It wants you to die.

802
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:04,691
So, Rene, you called us in

803
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:07,627
because you thought Edward was
in danger and needed saving.

804
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:11,097
You were right about that,
but based on what Amy told us,

805
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,966
you're in a lot of danger, too.

806
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:17,670
So now the big question is, can
you stay here and fight back,

807
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,506
or do you need to get out
while you still can?

808
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,709
So for that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

809
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,915
My overall suggestion

810
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,785
would be to move.

811
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,987
Wow.

812
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:40,026
This would leave no energy
source for the elemental,

813
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:44,764
and I think he would
then pass away.

814
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:47,133
But if you wanted to stay...

815
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:54,107
you would need to have
a male voodoo priest come

816
00:39:54,109 --> 00:40:00,480
and do a ritual
in order to expel him.

817
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,950
Why do you need a male voodoo
priest to get rid of the pastor?

818
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:07,386
Because it's something that
would absolutely terrify him.

819
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:10,923
He thinks that he has
religion on his side.

820
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,825
The second thing
would be to find

821
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,162
a Native American
holy person

822
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,699
to try to deal
with the elemental.

823
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:23,970
I don't know if that person
would be 100% successful,

824
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:25,805
so that's where
you're taking the chance.

825
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:28,641
It's a 50/50 shot,
and if it doesn't work,

826
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:33,379
that thing will eventually
kill you if you stay here.

827
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,481
Wow.

828
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:38,284
You really want to take
a 50% chance on your life?

829
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,987
- No.
- No. It's not worth it.

830
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,523
I want to live.
I wanna be happy.

831
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,828
This thing has tried to kill me
a couple of times,

832
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,996
and I got lucky.

833
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,531
I want away from it.

834
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,067
You kind of gotta make
a hard decision.

835
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:57,336
I don't see a way out.

836
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:01,674
We've been looking
at houses already.

837
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:05,545
We'll be prepared,
at least emotionally.

838
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,648
It's been a 4-year nightmare,

839
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,386
and this is the first help
that I've received.

840
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,123
It's a miracle that
we're sitting in front of you.

841
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,359
It really is, and I can't
thank you enough.

842
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:22,762
I'm all right with
the answer, though.

843
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,931
Didn't end well,

844
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:28,935
but we do
have a new beginning.

845
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:31,103
Rene and Edward
could have a voodoo priest

846
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:33,472
remove the pastor guy,

847
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:36,342
but there's no guarantee
a Native American holy person

848
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:39,078
could get rid
of the elemental,

849
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,181
so I really hope they take
my advice and move.

850
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:44,183
If they do that, they should
be able to lead

851
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,352
a safe and peaceful life.
