1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,295
There's a lot of chaos.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,670
He's like, "Get out of here.
I own this."

3
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,470
You just grab
your head in agony.

4
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:21,470
It literally felt like fire.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,110
You okay?

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,950
I'm just hearing "knife."

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,615
He died instantly.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,680
There's so much commotion here,

9
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,615
it's ridiculous.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,190
This is not a good situation.

11
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,942
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,625
There's death here.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,390
Don't wanna go down there.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,625
I see dead people.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,760
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,430
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,240
She's definitely
a serial killer.

18
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,242
...and they speak to me.

19
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,175
She's going to torture them.

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,010
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

21
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:01,847
They were all murdered.

22
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,551
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,185
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,985
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,720
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

26
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:13,255
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,130
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

28
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:18,795
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,460
Who do you think
possessed you?

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,595
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,670
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:25,865
...until the very end.

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,505
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,610
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

35
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:31,212
<i>Hell,</i> no.

36
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:32,745
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
Everyone is in jeopardy.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,890
I'm in Sahuarita, Arizona, about
a half-hour south of Tucson.

39
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,680
I got a call
from a woman named Karen

40
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:54,460
who just recently
moved into a new house.

41
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,655
Now she says
all hell has broken loose

42
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,805
and it's ripping
her marriage apart.

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,540
But this is what has got
her most worried --

44
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:03,575
Her daughter is
supposed to move in

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,175
with her two grandkids soon,
and she's worried

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,710
they're going to be stepping
into a paranormal war zone.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

48
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:17,150
of any leading information --

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,755
photographs, personal items.

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,030
Even medical equipment
can influence her findings,

51
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:27,865
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,130
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,490
This place is really,
really bad.

54
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,450
There's quite a lot going on.

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,330
There's a lot of chaos,
a lot of chaos.

56
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,425
It's<i> never</i> quiet.

57
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,600
I can understand why
nobody would sleep here.

58
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,240
There's so much commotion here,
it's ridiculous.

59
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,650
So, Karen, when we spoke on
the phone, you sounded upset.

60
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:19,385
What's going on?

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,820
We bought this house
about a year and a half ago.

62
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:24,385
This is our retirement home.

63
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
It was supposed to be
the forever home...

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,865
But it's not.

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,670
So your retirement home
is basically a war zone.

66
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,465
It is right now.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,665
You also mentioned
on the phone

68
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,200
that you were concerned
about your husband.

69
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,210
Yeah. His name is Don.

70
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,370
Okay.

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,165
And about 6 years ago,
he had a stroke.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,915
His moods changes
are getting worse.

73
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,110
Little tiny things
will just make him blow up.

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,115
I call him a human volcano.

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,490
So it's just you and Don
that live here.

76
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:56,655
Right now, yeah.

77
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,325
In about 5 weeks,
my youngest daughter

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,960
and two of my grandchildren
are moving in.

79
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,330
And how old are her kids?

80
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:05,965
4 and almost 9.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,930
So, Karen, you've got
to be concerned about

82
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,635
a 4 and an 8-year-old
moving in here.

83
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,920
Very concerned.
I'll do whatever you guys say.

84
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:16,997
What exactly are you guys
experiencing here?

85
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:21,040
There's everything
from noises and shadows

86
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,685
to physical touching,
scratching.

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
It's also affecting
my health.

88
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,390
Okay. So what's going on?

89
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:31,385
Headaches.

90
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,720
It feels like hot prod
to the point

91
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,930
where you just
grab your head in agony.

92
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:41,965
I don't sleep.
I'm up all night.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,530
You know, what are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm hoping that we can get
a happy home

95
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,975
for my daughter
and granddaughters,

96
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,940
and I'm concerned with Don
being here all the time,

97
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,412
so I want it to be
a good home.

98
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,815
You're not asking for a lot.

99
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,920
I don't think I could deal
with it if anything happened

100
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,820
to the girls
or the grandchildren.

101
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,360
I couldn't handle it.

102
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,660
I do feel sick.

103
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,275
I'm just getting, like,
horrible nausea,

104
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,440
so somebody is dealing
with that, a living person.

105
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,045
Headaches,

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,210
you know,
with the insomnia.

107
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,650
There is this guy here

108
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,320
who is dressed like a priest,

109
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,965
but I think he's lying
about being a priest.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
I think he's lying about
what he looks like.

111
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,560
He could be a demon.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,555
The nausea, the headaches,
the not sleeping

113
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,110
is a way that this thing
breaks people down

114
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,410
so that it can get them.

115
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,835
So what's going on
in this room?

116
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,785
I was sitting
in my recliner.

117
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
My leg started burning,
and I looked down,

118
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,590
and I had scratches.

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,700
How bad of a scratch
was it?

120
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:21,082
- It raised the skin.
- Okay.

121
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,430
And the worst part was
the burn.

122
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,900
Now you told me you have cats.

123
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,065
Could it have been the cats?

124
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,635
No, 'cause they were
in their bedroom.

125
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,770
Okay, so there was
no animals in here?
No.

126
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,480
Okay, have you ever been
physically touched

127
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,180
like that anyplace else
or before?
Yes.

128
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,475
- Right in the hallway...
- Okay.

129
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,920
...I was sweeping,
and I had my arm grabbed.

130
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,820
Okay, describe to me
how it felt.

131
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:42,915
Okay. Like that.

132
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,155
- That hard?
- That hard.

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,420
Now have you had
muscle spasms before?
No.

134
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,860
All right,
is there anything else?

135
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:50,895
Yeah. Shadows.

136
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,465
I see a lot of shadows,

137
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,665
and there's this almost
constant parade at times.

138
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
All right, so do these shadows
have any shape, like a human?

139
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:01,400
I don't really see them
as a shape.

140
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,870
It's more of a mist
or a mass.

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,380
Now how often
are you seeing them?

142
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,680
Almost daily.

143
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,420
People see a lot of...
outside here.

144
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,150
There is a path,

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,520
and then I got a line of, like,

146
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,730
shadow people lining up.

147
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,595
Yeah, they're all in line,

148
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,265
one behind the other,
single file.

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,570
But they're not shadow people.
They're dead people.

150
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,910
Is there any connection
between this priest guy

151
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,127
and these people that are
lined up and walking?

152
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,310
I don't really know, but I think
these dead people,

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,015
the living see them.

154
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,150
I think they just, like,
see them, like,

155
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:48,615
corner of their eye.

156
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,220
They're somewhere in the house.

157
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:54,120
It's very stressful.

158
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,090
Stress. Stress.

159
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,560
Stress.

160
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,200
All right, so what's
going on down here?

161
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,160
As I get into bed
and I'm just settling in,

162
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:13,075
I felt somebody
crawl over the top of me.

163
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,065
I'm in full prayer mode,
and it just went away.

164
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,020
Any of the animals stay in bed
with you guys?

165
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,285
No. No.
The dogs have kennels...

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,660
Okay.
...that are over on
the far side of the room.

167
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:28,355
Okay.

168
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,330
All right.
so anything else?

169
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:31,395
Well, yes.

170
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,650
A couple nights ago,
when I laid down,

171
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,362
I could feel something
sit next to me,

172
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,005
pulling the blankets tight
around my legs.

173
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,240
Okay, can you show me
how hard the pressure was?

174
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,405
It was just like this.

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,980
Okay, so as if a normal person
was sitting down on the bed.

176
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,540
Right.

177
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,650
I'm trying to figure out
what else it could be.

178
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,745
I'm at a loss right now.

179
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,335
I don't know why
they're grabbing me.

180
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,665
And why would
they crawl over me?

181
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,960
I just know
that I want them gone.

182
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,560
Yeah.

183
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,655
I'm seeing, like, vomiting,
crying, punching.

184
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,740
And, I mean, I think
this is happening now

185
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,070
with a living person here.

186
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,640
They're vulnerable
to, priest man.

187
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,215
The priest comes

188
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,555
and becomes
as thin as the blanket,

189
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,720
and then it's melding
into the person's body.

190
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,800
So what is this thing doing to
this person when it does this?

191
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:43,800
It goes inside of their body.

192
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,130
Like, all the way in,

193
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,360
into all of the bones
and the muscles and the tissues.

194
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:53,580
I see it, like, affecting
the physiology of the person.

195
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,080
What does it want
from this person?

196
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,280
Death.

197
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,400
So, Don, I was talking
to your wife Karen,

198
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,735
and she's concerned about

199
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,510
her daughter coming to live
with the kids.

200
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,070
Yeah. I'm concerned, too.

201
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,010
I mean, I don't want them
in here

202
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,640
if it's not safe for them.

203
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,210
Now as far as
your own experiences,

204
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,510
can you tell me about any?

205
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,700
Yeah. I see shadow figures
all the time.

206
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,880
Karen mentioned
the same thing to me.

207
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,890
Okay, so how often are you
seeing these shadows?

208
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,655
Daily basis.

209
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,040
All right, Don,
anything else?

210
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,390
Yeah, in the downstairs
bathroom,

211
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,425
I would get pushed

212
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,800
almost every time
I took a shower.

213
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,160
I know you had a stroke.

214
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,770
Could it be a side effect
from some of the medications

215
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,935
you're taking?
No.

216
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm down to only
blood pressure medications now.

217
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,370
All right, Don,
anything else?

218
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,675
I was downstairs,

219
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,430
and I heard Karen crying
uncontrollably upstairs,

220
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:02,150
so I'm running upstairs
to see what was wrong.

221
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,315
And when I got there,
she was just fine

222
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,820
and said that she hadn't been
crying, that she was quiet.

223
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,890
All right. What about a TV
or a radio being on?

224
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,255
No. It wasn't on.

225
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,055
Okay, mow did you ever
hear that again?

226
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,090
Yeah. It actually happened
the other way around after that.

227
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,690
- She heard you?
- Yes.

228
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Karen said that
she heard me screaming

229
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:21,765
like something
was really wrong,

230
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,030
that I was pissed off
about something.

231
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,570
Okay. You sure you weren't
going crazy and having a fit?

232
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,400
No. I was folding laundry.

233
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,210
All right, this is...
That's a little strange.

234
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,780
- Yeah.
- Okay.

235
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,780
The priest, who now
is claiming to be a demon,

236
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,055
I think he can jump people.

237
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,720
Like, the word,
the possession word,

238
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,655
is being thrown around a lot.

239
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:54,688
Living people see, like,
this pretty thick, black mist,

240
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,523
and it's pretty tall.

241
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,243
That's how he melds with people.

242
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,893
Like, that's why
he's in that form,

243
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,878
so he can meld easily
with people's bodies.

244
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:05,870
The way that,
that would affect the living,

245
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,828
I'm seeing, you know,
them acting crazy.

246
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:11,903
And they wouldn't remember.

247
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:15,108
Say they're eating,
and then all of a sudden,

248
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:17,875
somebody jumps up
from the kitchen table

249
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,479
and is like, "I'm gonna...
kill everyone!"

250
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:23,048
That's this thing, like,
jumping them.

251
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,883
It speaks through the living.

252
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,088
So, Don, talking to Karen,
she also mentioned to me

253
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,358
that you're having
mood swings.

254
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:31,718
Your attitude has changed.

255
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,988
What's the story there?

256
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,593
I will, all of a sudden,

257
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:38,858
get really frustrated
or get really mad,

258
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,828
and I don't know why
I feel like that.

259
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,933
It just hits me,
and I just...

260
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:47,868
I'll get really mad
and frustrated out of the blue.

261
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:50,473
Are you afraid
you might get physical?

262
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,713
I'm just afraid that, yeah,
I'm gonna yell or scream

263
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:56,918
or say something that's really
going to hurt somebody,

264
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:59,413
and I don't mean it.
Okay.

265
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,848
I mean, do you think Karen's
afraid of you when this happens?

266
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:04,418
Well, she will tell me
sometimes, "You're yelling."

267
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:06,258
And it's, "I'm not
trying to yell.

268
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:08,088
I'm just trying to talk
to you."

269
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,758
I want to do whatever it takes
to protect our family.

270
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,380
- Okay.
- You know, this is something

271
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:13,968
that I just can't fight
on my own.

272
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:15,833
Okay.

273
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:19,568
This priest-demon thing...

274
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:26,173
...will go after the weak
and vulnerable.

275
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:31,278
I think he's trying to do that
with somebody at this location.

276
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:36,118
There's something about this
place that attracts bad things.

277
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,698
Karen told me
her daughter Valerie plans

278
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,063
on moving into the house
with her kids.

279
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:48,868
Now she's not in state,
so I'm reaching out to her

280
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:51,603
on video chat to see
if she's had any experiences.

281
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:54,568
So, Val, I got to tell you, I've
been talking to your parents,

282
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,268
and I'm not sure
it's such a good idea

283
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:58,438
for you to move in here
with the kids.

284
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,843
I mean, how you feel
about that?

285
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,608
<i> It is very concerning.</i>
<i> My mom is allowing us</i>

286
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,878
<i> to come in and get back</i>
<i> on our feet</i>

287
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:08,448
<i> after a divorce and try</i>
<i> to reestablish ourselves.</i>

288
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,323
<i> But if things can't</i>
<i> get figured out,</i>

289
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:13,058
<i> I may have to find</i>
<i> a different living situation.</i>

290
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,963
So have you visited
the house here in Arizona?

291
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:19,628
<i> Yes, actually. I have</i>
<i> been there multiple times.</i>

292
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:22,733
When you were here,
did you have any experiences?

293
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:26,668
<i> Yeah. I've experienced</i>
<i> a shadow a couple of times.</i>

294
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,808
Okay. It seems everybody's
seen shadows here.

295
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:30,243
How did you experience it?

296
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,908
<i> I was sitting on the love seat</i>
<i> in the living room,</i>

297
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:35,513
<i> and off to my right-hand side,</i>

298
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:38,548
<i> there was a shadow</i>
<i> that would walk in front of it</i>

299
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,288
<i> and block the reflection.</i>

300
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,783
All right. Anything else?

301
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:45,118
<i> I've had feelings</i>
<i> of being watched.</i>

302
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:47,128
Now was that in anyplace
specific in the house?

303
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:50,063
<i> Mainly downstairs.</i>

304
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,913
<i> It just felt like somebody</i>
<i> was in the room watching me.</i>

305
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,728
<i> I would feel like I was going</i>
<i> to have a panic attack.</i>

306
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:57,903
You got to be concerned
about yourself

307
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,133
and the kids at this point,
if they do come here.

308
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:04,008
<i> I'm afraid that, with</i>
<i> the children being so young,</i>

309
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:07,848
<i> that they may be vulnerable</i>
<i> to attacks on themself.</i>

310
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,548
My feeling, at this point,

311
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,718
about the priest/demon thing

312
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,993
is that it was a human.

313
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:22,813
And this person was religious.

314
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:25,563
And I don't think they look like

315
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:29,768
how they presented themselves
to me at any time.

316
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,098
This priest-demon guy
is going nuts.

317
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,838
He's like, "Get out of here.
I own this."

318
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,773
Like, "Get the...out of here,

319
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,578
or I'm gonna, like,
kill everybody."

320
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,328
So I made my usual calls
when I got into town,

321
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:59,058
and a local journalist
just called back

322
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,953
and said he's got something
that's going to help me out.

323
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,838
Apparently, a hotel owner got
lost wandering in the desert

324
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:07,908
and ended up dying right on
Karen and Don's property.

325
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,783
So, David, do me a favor.
Set the scene for me.

326
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:20,218
When this guy wandered
onto my clients' property,

327
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,953
when was this,
and who owned the property?

328
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:25,158
Well, your clients' property
was part of a ranch owned

329
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,453
by a man named
James Kilroy Brown.

330
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:31,428
Brown had purchased
the property in 1877

331
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:34,068
and named it
the Sahuarito Ranch.

332
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:35,263
All right.

333
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,583
Over time, the ranch grew
to about 4,000 acres.

334
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,868
All right, so now this guy
has got 4,000 acres.

335
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:41,003
But what's he do with it?

336
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,603
Well, Brown fully utilized
his 4,000 acres

337
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:47,243
as a cattle ranch as well
as, also, a stage stop.

338
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,998
All right. So what can you tell
me about the guy that got lost?

339
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,718
Well, the gentleman that got
lost, his name was James Dixon.

340
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,553
He was a hotel owner
in Tucson.

341
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:58,118
He invested in mines
in southern Arizona.

342
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:02,793
On May 1, 1887, he decided to
take a wagon and a horse

343
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,798
and head down towards his mines
to see how they were doing.

344
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,768
And on the way down there,
he stops at the Sahuarito Ranch,

345
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,385
just to water his horse
for a little bit,

346
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,968
and then decides
to continue on going south.

347
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:16,073
At that point,
he ends up getting lost.

348
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,058
And if you look out here,
this is not a place

349
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,008
you want to get lost
in the middle of summer.

350
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,608
It's deadly.

351
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,278
Well, eventually,
Brown gets wind of this

352
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,413
and gathered together

353
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,988
a bunch of the ranchers
in the area,

354
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,720
and they formed a search party.

355
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,418
It actually made
the local paper.

356
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,288
Brown basically did
the right thing.

357
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:36,923
He didn't have to look
for this guy.

358
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,968
And they searched for days
and days, and eventually,

359
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:44,438
they find Dixon lying
under a tree, half-naked.

360
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:45,703
Now why would he do that?

361
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:48,638
I think he went plumb crazy
wandering the desert.

362
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:49,803
What did they do with him?

363
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:52,073
Well, Brown takes him
back to the ranch,

364
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:56,108
and Dixon dies on your clients'
property that night.

365
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,083
Here's an article about that.

366
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,648
Sadly, Dixon was
only 47 years old,

367
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,188
and he had a wife and two
daughters he left behind.

368
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:06,588
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,863
I'm seeing a church.

370
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,968
I think it belongs
to the priest-demon guy.

371
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:17,038
In the pews were
all of these dead people.

372
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:19,933
They're freaked out,

373
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,973
and they're trapped
in this space by the priest.

374
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:25,978
But he ain't no priest.
He ain't no Catholic.

375
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:29,208
He is a fake, false prophet.

376
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,583
He'll kill 'em off

377
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:35,848
and put 'em
into one of the pews.

378
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,628
So far, I've got a couple
being tormented on a property

379
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,563
where a lost traveler died,

380
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,933
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

381
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,368
Searching through old records,
I come across an article

382
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:52,903
about a homeless Mexican man

383
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:55,673
who was brutally murdered
back in 1893.

384
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,393
It turns out
the homicide took place

385
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,043
right next to
Karen and Don's property.

386
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:03,678
I asked a local sergeant to look
into this murder for me,

387
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,983
and he stumbled
onto a second homicide.

388
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:08,548
It's a small town, so I'm
actually kind of surprised,

389
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,418
but hopefully, one of these
will help my case.

390
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,913
So, Mike, thanks
for meeting with me.

391
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,468
The homicide I found,
what were you able

392
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,898
to find out
about the victim?

393
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,303
We don't know a lot.

394
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:25,798
We know that he's homeless
and his name is Pancho Mendozo.

395
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,338
How's he wind up
getting murdered?

396
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,273
On October 13, 1893,

397
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:33,708
he was passing by
the James Kilroy Brown Ranch,

398
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,113
which is now
your clients' property,

399
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,533
and I guess he got tired
and he got hot, and he decided

400
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,918
he was going to lay down
underneath a mesquite tree

401
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:42,548
and take a nap.

402
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,258
While he's doing that, he's not
aware that he's being followed,

403
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:46,358
but what happens is,
is that the murderer came up

404
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,940
and caught him
while he was asleep

405
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:49,488
and stabbed him
once in the throat

406
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,558
and once in the right side
of the abdomen.

407
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,558
He had died instantly.

408
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,733
They ever make an arrest?

409
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,568
The sheriff did make
an arrest.

410
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,333
Did he get indicted,
convicted?

411
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:01,233
No, there was no indictment.
They weren't convicted.

412
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,953
There was -- The grand jury
could not agree on the charges.

413
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:06,638
All right, so it's 1893.
You got a homeless Mexican guy.

414
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:08,243
What did they do with
the body?

415
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:09,513
At that time,
he didn't have any money,

416
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:11,243
and he had no family,
nobody to claim the body,

417
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,088
so they buried him very close
to exactly where he was killed,

418
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,588
right near
your clients' property.

419
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:16,783
- You're kidding me.
- No.

420
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,388
That's just the way
they did it back then.

421
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,588
There's this older drunk guy

422
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:28,068
who looks like he was,
back in the day, from Mexico.

423
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,803
I feel sick.

424
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,423
And I'm feeling, like...pain,

425
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,218
lots of pain all through here.

426
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,765
I'm hearing all these noises.

427
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,278
I was outside, and then "knife."

428
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:43,913
I'm just hearing "knife."

429
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,848
I don't know what that is.
And I hear, "Back away."

430
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,748
All right, so, Mike,
you mentioned on the phone

431
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,808
there was a second homicide
you found.
Correct.

432
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:53,858
Okay, so what can you tell me
about the victim?

433
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,728
The victim's name
is Glendell Soape.

434
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:58,223
He's 25 years old.

435
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,558
He's married
and has three kids,

436
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,033
and he's from
Scottsdale, Arizona.

437
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:03,128
All right, so I assume
he's down here on business.

438
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,533
Well, actually,
on May 23, 1963,

439
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:09,608
he went down
to a predominantly black bar

440
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,903
looking for a prostitute,

441
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,178
and goes up
to a perfect stranger,

442
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,243
whose name is Leo Davis,

443
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:19,218
and asked him if he can
hook him up with a black girl.

444
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,818
- And does he get hooked up?
- He did so.

445
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,348
He went
and found one for him,

446
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,408
and they went and had sex
outside of the bar.

447
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:28,423
- Does the pros set him up?
- No, not at all.

448
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,728
After they were done having sex,
he decides, all of a sudden,

449
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:35,630
that he wants to go to Mexico
and get cheap liquor.

450
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:39,498
So he jumps in the car
with his new friend, Leo Davis,

451
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,973
and another guy
and the prostitute,

452
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,643
and they all head
down the road for Mexico.

453
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,278
Well, about a mile from
your clients' property,

454
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:50,595
they pull off
the side of the road.

455
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,878
So Davis slugs Mr. Soape
in the head,

456
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,083
and then
they both grabbed him,

457
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:56,888
pulled him out of the car,
killed him,

458
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:59,153
and take his watch
and $600.

459
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:02,488
And I have his certificate
of death right here.

460
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:05,658
Cause of death was
listed as a broken neck.

461
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:06,958
So did this guy Davis

462
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:08,528
or anybody else
get arrested for this?

463
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:09,828
Yes. They did.

464
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:11,638
A couple months later,
the prostitute gave up both men.

465
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:14,273
Here's the article.

466
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:15,858
They were convicted,
and both of them

467
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:17,408
were sentenced
to life in prison.

468
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:24,718
When I walked out here,
I was seeing, like,

469
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,983
a guy,

470
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:28,253
and I was seeing, like,

471
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:30,583
him feeling
like he was burning.

472
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:35,058
Like, it literally felt
like fire, like, on the inside.

473
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:37,323
All of a sudden,
he's like, "...!"

474
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:40,558
Like, somebody's, like,
kicking him in the shins,

475
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,468
and then he's feeling hit
in the back here.

476
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:45,063
You know what I mean?

477
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,468
And then he's on the ground.

478
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,008
Very scary.

479
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,653
Look, it's Arizona,
so obviously,

480
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,173
there's gonna be a lot
of Native American history.

481
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,623
But I just got off the phone
with local historian

482
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:24,998
who says a tribe that lived
where Don and Karen's house sits

483
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,163
was involved
in a horrific massacre.

484
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,198
I'm driving over now to
find out exactly what happened.

485
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,508
So, Bridgette, before we get
to the massacre

486
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,943
you told me about
on the phone,

487
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:42,408
what can you tell me
about the tribe that lived

488
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:43,713
on my clients' property?

489
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:45,383
The tribe was called
the Tohono O'odham,

490
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:47,918
and they've been in this area
for hundreds of years.

491
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,948
Here's a picture
that we have of them.

492
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,483
And they actually are
still around.

493
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,588
They have a large reservation
just west of here.

494
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:57,028
So this big massacre,
who was involved?

495
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,323
The massacre was between

496
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:00,358
the Tohono O'odham
and the Apache.

497
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:01,933
Okay. So now
what was the beef?

498
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:05,968
Well, the Apache would come to
the Tohono O'odham settlements,

499
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:08,103
and they would raid
and they would steal,

500
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:10,768
and they would often kill a lot
of the Tohono O'odham people.

501
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:11,973
Now did any of these attacks

502
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:14,073
by the Apache happen
on my clients' property?

503
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,348
We don't have any record
of them actually happening

504
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:17,883
on your clients' property,

505
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:19,478
but we're sure
they happened nearby.

506
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,648
So, Bridgette, tell me
about the massacre.

507
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:24,218
It started in
the spring of 1871.

508
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,383
The Apaches surrendered

509
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,923
to the American government
at Camp Grant,

510
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,393
and these are some pictures
of Camp Grant.

511
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:34,098
It's about 60 miles north
from your clients' property.

512
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,068
Okay, so it's north up here.

513
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,428
Okay. So what happened?

514
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:40,098
The Tohono O'odham saw
an opportunity to attack,

515
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:41,908
so they traveled 2 days.
- Okay.

516
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,673
And they go up to
Camp Grant.

517
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:48,308
On April 30, 1871, at dawn,
they attacked.

518
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:49,843
144 people died,

519
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:52,513
and 136 of those
were women and children.

520
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,848
All right. So all these people
dead. Did anybody survive?

521
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:56,053
They take any prisoners?

522
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:58,188
There were 30 children
that did survive,

523
00:24:58,223 --> 00:24:59,753
and they were sold
into slavery,

524
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:02,228
and they were marched down
into Sonora, Mexico.

525
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:04,088
There's a road
that actually went

526
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:05,863
right by
your clients' property.

527
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:09,233
And a couple of them did
manage to escape.

528
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:12,938
This is one that we know
for sure made it back,

529
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,108
and as far as we know,
the rest of them

530
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,873
died in slavery
down in Mexico.

531
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:20,238
All right. So did anybody pay
for this massacre at all?

532
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:24,048
The territory governor
arrested over 100 people,

533
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,648
and when the verdict
went to the jury,

534
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:27,783
they were all acquitted.

535
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,748
Nobody got convicted
of anything?
No.

536
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,458
The people of Pima County were
very supportive of the massacre,

537
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:36,088
so the Apache
never saw justice.

538
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:47,398
The Native Americans
cursed this land.

539
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:52,308
That stems from way, way, way,
way, way, way, way,<i> way</i> back,

540
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,078
from the murder and mayhem
that was committed.

541
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:59,778
This was specific to this area.

542
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,618
They were tying Native Americans

543
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,618
that they had captured.

544
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:11,163
These Native Americans
were slaves.

545
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:14,398
I don't know exactly
what they were forced to do,

546
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:17,533
but I just saw
the word "slaves."

547
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:19,168
Is the priest
trapping them in the church

548
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,008
with the other dead people?

549
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,303
I think so. Yeah.

550
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:26,338
Some of them were
pretty much skeletons

551
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,408
with just, like, little bits
of flesh hanging off.

552
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:36,288
So I'm estimating that there
were about 80 of these people.

553
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,383
The ones who were
almost skeletons, I think,

554
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:42,488
died at the same time,
so they're in a lot of pain.

555
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:53,568
During my walk, I saw a whole
bunch of disturbing things,

556
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:55,273
but two stood out.

557
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:57,468
First,
the group of shadow figures

558
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:59,043
marching through the house.

559
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:03,348
What I saw in this hallway was,
in single file,

560
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:06,548
shadow people,
and different heights.

561
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:12,258
Next, I described
the priest-demon

562
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,453
tormenting the living.

563
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:18,328
You can see that he was
looking like a human

564
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:22,165
and it stands by the bed

565
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,933
and it becomes a thin mist

566
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:29,708
and it covers the person
and then it meshes into them.

567
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:36,348
Amy, is this what you saw?

568
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,348
Yes.

569
00:27:57,238 --> 00:28:00,098
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

570
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:02,538
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

571
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:05,143
and our clients
for the first time.

572
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:08,013
Well, Amy, I want you to meet
Karen and Don.

573
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:10,843
They bought this house
about a year and a half ago,

574
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:13,878
and they were hoping to make it
a dream retirement home.

575
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,148
Obviously, that hasn't
worked out that way.

576
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:19,718
But the main reason we're here
is Karen's daughter, Valerie.

577
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:23,488
Now she's in a tough spot
and is supposed to move in here

578
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:25,428
with her two daughters.
Next month?

579
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:26,858
- Yeah.
- Okay.

580
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:28,928
The problem is, these guys
don't think it's safe,

581
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:32,938
so I'll ask Amy to describe
her walk for us.

582
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,808
When I first arrived,
and I saw murder and mayhem

583
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,543
that happened here
a long, long time ago.

584
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:45,178
It involved Native Americans
who had ties to the land.

585
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:48,613
They were being utilized
as slaves.

586
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:52,618
The other thing is that there
was a curse placed on this land

587
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,853
a very long time ago.

588
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:57,358
I got something with slaves
when I did the research.

589
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:59,660
It was an Indian tribe
called the Tohono O'odham...

590
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,928
Okay.
...who lived
in and around your property

591
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:03,863
for hundreds of years.

592
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,138
Now I actually have a photo
of what they had looked like

593
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:08,308
back in the 1850s.

594
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:13,678
But there was bad blood
between them and the Apaches.

595
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:16,108
They took abuse
from the Apaches for years.

596
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:19,518
Now in 1871, the Tohono O'odham
got their revenge.

597
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:20,583
The Apaches surrendered

598
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:22,503
to the U.S. government
at Camp Grant,

599
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:24,388
which is about 60 miles north
of here.

600
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,818
Here's a picture of Camp Grant.

601
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:32,423
On April 28, 1871,
the local tribe headed north

602
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,468
and surrounded the camp,
and it turned into a bloodbath.

603
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:39,938
By the end of it,
144 people were killed.

604
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:42,838
136 of them
were women and children.

605
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:45,143
Wow.

606
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,713
Now about 30 of these Apache
kids survived the massacre,

607
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:52,248
but they marched them
down past here into Mexico...

608
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,578
...to sell them off
into slavery.

609
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:57,788
And I actually have a picture
of one of the Native Americans

610
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,888
that we know escaped.

611
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,198
My god. I've seen her.

612
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,893
I've seen her.

613
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:11,313
When I close my eyes
at night, I-I see...

614
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:13,698
- Here, sweetie. Take that.
- ...I see people.

615
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:21,813
I just hope
she's okay somewhere.

616
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:25,778
I'll just put this picture here.
It seems to be upsetting you.

617
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:27,148
You think this could have
something to do

618
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:30,153
with the curse on the land?
Yes.

619
00:30:30,188 --> 00:30:34,858
Essentially, the curse
is that anyone who's white

620
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:38,598
will not live
a peaceful life here.

621
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:43,863
So what else happened
on the walk?

622
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,738
So I came inside,
and I was pulled immediately

623
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,873
to the downstairs hallway.

624
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:52,178
And I was then
in a male's body,

625
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:55,973
and he was in a lot of pain,

626
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:59,518
and I started to hear
all of these noises around him.

627
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,283
So we're outside,

628
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:05,283
and I felt like I was being
stabbed in my side.

629
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:09,758
And I, of course, felt very ill,
and I didn't really understand

630
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,723
what the hell was happening,

631
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,863
and then I heard
the word "knife."

632
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,598
So, Amy, that's not much
to go on,

633
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,700
but it does sound
like a homicide

634
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:19,733
I did come across
in my research.

635
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:22,133
Now the victim's name
was Pancho Mendozo.

636
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,468
We didn't know much about this
guy other than he was homeless,

637
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,908
and he was about 55 to 60.

638
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,843
On October 13, 1893,

639
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:31,618
Mendozo was traveling
from Tucson to Mexico,

640
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:33,678
passing right through
your property.

641
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:37,018
So he was tired and decided to
take a little nap nearby a tree.

642
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:39,788
It turns out he was
being followed.

643
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:41,593
While Mendozo was sleeping,

644
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:43,893
someone came up to him
and attacked him.

645
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:47,358
He was stabbed twice, once in
the throat and in the torso.

646
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:50,468
And he basically bled out
and died on the scene.

647
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,468
To this day, the case
is still unsolved.

648
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:53,833
Wow.

649
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,968
This is the real kicker
of the whole thing --

650
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:58,173
Mendozo had no family or money,

651
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,108
and he was buried
right under the tree

652
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:02,008
where they found him.
Interesting.

653
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:07,778
So what else happened
on the walk?

654
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:11,858
When I was outside,
I saw a lot of dead people

655
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:14,218
walking in single file,

656
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:17,888
and they're on
a specific pathway,

657
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:20,558
and it goes right through
your house.

658
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:23,028
Here I'm seeing four,
and here I'm seeing eight.

659
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,998
At the same time, living people
would see them as shadow people.

660
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:29,773
But they're not.
They're just dead people.

661
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:32,058
- I refer to it as a parade...
- Yeah. Okay.

662
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:34,308
...going through the house
this way.-

663
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:37,878
And I'll see, like,
two, four, six.

664
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,083
Crazy.

665
00:32:39,118 --> 00:32:40,853
It's like it's a constant,
daily...

666
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:42,588
- Now you see them too, Don.
- Yeah.

667
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:43,783
Interesting. Okay.

668
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:46,418
When I spoke to Valerie
on a video conference,

669
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,588
she described the same thing.

670
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:52,558
I did have a sketch done
of what I was kind of seeing.

671
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:00,538
Take a look at that.

672
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:02,538
My god.

673
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,708
And that's how it looks
to you, Karen?

674
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:06,973
Yeah. Yeah.

675
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:10,108
It's like wave after
wave after wave.

676
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,078
Now you know you're not nuts.

677
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,578
Thank you.

678
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:19,018
All right,
so interesting walk so far.

679
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:20,223
What else?

680
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:24,123
So then I ran into

681
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:26,663
an entity here that, to me,

682
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:28,793
represents
the biggest problem.

683
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:33,198
He's dressed like
a Catholic priest,

684
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,473
but he's not really
a priest at all,

685
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:39,458
but I couldn't figure out
if he was a demon

686
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:42,408
or if, in fact,
he had once been human.

687
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:43,478
So what was he?

688
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,543
A dead person.

689
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:49,488
And he started, like,
swearing and cursing at me,

690
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:52,205
being very threatening
and saying

691
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,888
that he was going
to kill all of us.

692
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:59,298
When I met him,
he's in a church,

693
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,328
and in his church,

694
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:07,303
he has a lot of dead people.

695
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:11,843
So his thing is he is
collecting all of these people

696
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:16,348
and brings them into this church
that he's created,

697
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:19,115
and he's trapping them there.

698
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,813
So does this priest thing...

699
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:24,253
Would it interact
with these guys?

700
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:26,658
I think that it does have
the ability

701
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,660
to go after you physically.

702
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:30,593
I had an experience
last night

703
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:33,428
where he was messing
with my throat,

704
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:36,600
so I got these four lines,

705
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,066
and it was burning
like a...

706
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:41,498
- Yeah.
- That's you.

707
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:43,458
That's me.

708
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,373
I came home from work,

709
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:49,108
and within just a couple minutes
of walking in the door,

710
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:52,278
my leg starting burning
like a chemical burn.

711
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:54,013
I looked down,

712
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:58,318
and I had three scratches
right up the calf.

713
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:00,418
He likes to go after
the weak and sick

714
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,393
din this house specifically.

715
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:03,978
That's easy prey for him.

716
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:05,493
I did feel that there was

717
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:07,798
a living individual
in this house

718
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,033
that had become
a target for him

719
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:14,053
and that this thing
is making this person sicker.

720
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:18,038
I had a stroke 6 years ago,
and I've had, you know,

721
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:19,738
ongoing blood-pressure issues.

722
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:24,408
I got specific illness traits
of terrible headaches,

723
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:27,213
nausea, and insomnia,

724
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:30,748
and essentially, what he's doing
is torturing the person.

725
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:33,458
I've been put on
a sleeping pill.

726
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:34,453
Tell her about the headaches,

727
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,788
the way you described them
to me.

728
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:38,493
I get these intense...

729
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:42,028
It's almost like a fire prod

730
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:45,263
being put in your head.

731
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:47,198
Now is he targeting
both of them?

732
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:53,338
Well, I think that
it's mainly you,

733
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:57,108
but it's not just
one person.

734
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:58,348
The guy is into torture.

735
00:35:58,383 --> 00:35:59,483
- Yeah.
- You know?

736
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:03,418
And the worst thing is that
he can jump people.

737
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,318
He can make himself appear
like a black mist,

738
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:10,493
and then he'll meld
into the person's body.

739
00:36:10,528 --> 00:36:14,163
This can cause mood swings,
and when he does that,

740
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:17,798
he literally speaks through
the living in this house.

741
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:21,298
And so I saw people
yelling out strange things.

742
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:23,123
You know, you're
sitting at the table.

743
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:24,938
You're eating, and then,
all of a sudden,

744
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:26,203
somebody jumps up
and is like,

745
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:29,378
"I'm gonna...kill everybody!"
just out of nowhere,

746
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:32,518
and then has no recollection
that they did that.

747
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,783
Yeah.
I was downstairs one day,

748
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,088
and I heard Karen up here
crying uncontrollably,

749
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,653
so I come running upstairs.

750
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:42,258
She was sitting in the chair
and just said, "I was fine."

751
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,158
And then, about a week
or two later, she goes,

752
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:47,858
"I heard you
downstairs yelling and..."

753
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:49,368
- Throwing a full tantrum.
- I said, "No."

754
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:52,103
- Wow.
- I was fine.

755
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:54,538
And you've got the mood swings
you were talking.

756
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:57,005
Yeah. All of a sudden,
I'll get extremely frustrated

757
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,709
to the point where, you know,
I almost start to vibrate,

758
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:02,378
but then I just get pissed off
and I don't know why.

759
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:05,378
His whole
speech mannerism changes.

760
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,818
And it's like,
"Don, knock it off."
Yeah.

761
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:13,023
Yeah. You okay? Yeah.

762
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,718
It's tough to hear.
I know.

763
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:16,488
- Yeah.
- You okay?

764
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,723
It's okay.

765
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:21,558
That's why
we're doing this.

766
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:23,228
- Right?
- It's not you, Don.

767
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:25,768
- Right.
- It's okay, man.

768
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:28,298
It's okay.
We can get this fixed.

769
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:31,973
You can be happy.

770
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:35,408
Now this thing do anything else
besides torture these people?

771
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:37,678
- Um...
- It's doing a good job of that.

772
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,383
I was in the downstairs
basement,

773
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:42,248
and I saw him standing
at the end of the bed.

774
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:43,383
God.

775
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:45,283
And then he became
that mist again,

776
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:49,588
and he will sink
into the person's body.

777
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:51,393
Obviously, this affects

778
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:53,758
the living person's
body horribly.

779
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:58,368
Gosh.

780
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,533
Um...

781
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:04,508
I had just gone to bed,
and I felt something

782
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,938
from the foot of the bed,

783
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:12,078
hand, knee, crawl
right over my body.

784
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:13,413
You also had another experience

785
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:14,748
where it felt like somebody
sat on the bed.

786
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,113
Yes.

787
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:20,488
I'll be laying in bed,
and you can feel somebody sit.

788
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:22,853
The blankets tighten,

789
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:27,558
and from my knees
to my feet got ice cold.

790
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:31,568
I did have a sketch done
of that situation that I saw.

791
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:41,143
Jeez.

792
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:43,378
You guys have been through
a lot tonight. All right.

793
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:51,848
My god.

794
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:57,628
Valerie's bringing
her small kids here.

795
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:59,423
Would they be in danger, too?

796
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,798
Yes. Absolutely,
the children, yeah.

797
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,398
That scares the hell
out of me.

798
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:15,208
What the hell does this priest
thing want from these guys?

799
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,608
His goal is to kill you guys,

800
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:20,318
and it's definitely got you
in mind for his church.

801
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,268
Well, Karen, you called us in
because you were worried

802
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:40,503
about Valerie moving in
with the grandkids.

803
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:45,278
Turns out bringing us in may
have saved you and Don's life.

804
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:46,738
Now we're gonna answer
the big question.

805
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:49,248
Can you kick this
priest-demon thing out,

806
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,543
and what's it going to take?

807
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:52,218
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

808
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:57,353
There are things you can do,

809
00:39:57,388 --> 00:40:00,423
but the thing you do need
to be aware of

810
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,778
is that you will deal
with issues on a daily basis

811
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:09,098
because of the area
and the curse that's here.

812
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,328
So basically,
you'll never have peace

813
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:14,838
like you've known prior
to moving to this place.

814
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,755
So the first thing is
to bring a medium in

815
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,638
and simply have them
help the stabbing victim

816
00:40:20,648 --> 00:40:23,508
and the group
of dead people move on.

817
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:25,283
What I would like for you to do

818
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:28,883
in dealing with
this priest dead guy

819
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:32,173
is a true Catholic priest
needs to come in

820
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,393
and do a blessing
at the property line.

821
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:39,258
Then, using rosaries that have
been blessed by the same priest,

822
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:40,893
so five rosaries,

823
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:42,793
bury them at approximately

824
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:45,498
the four corners
of your property

825
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,398
and then place the fifth one

826
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,673
in the approximate center
of the house.

827
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,808
Now once they do all this,
will this priest-demon

828
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,078
get the hell out of here?

829
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:55,073
Correct.

830
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:56,473
It won't be easy.

831
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:58,863
But we need to do it,
and we're going to do it.

832
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:01,183
You're worth it.
The grandkids are worth it.

833
00:41:01,218 --> 00:41:04,418
So now if they do everything
you told them they need to do,

834
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,658
is Don going to feel better?

835
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:08,375
I think you will.

836
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,023
What about Karen?

837
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:12,158
She'll be able to go to sleep,
no more of those big headaches?

838
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:13,963
That'll be done.

839
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:16,533
Maybe we can actually unpack,

840
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:20,238
and you don't turn into
evil grandpa.

841
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:21,733
Well, that's good.

842
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,338
I'm glad to see smiles on your
faces at the end of all this.

843
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:24,573
We can do it.

844
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,808
We've been through a lot
of other worse stuff.

845
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,578
There's a light at the end
of the tunnel.

846
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:32,748
Karen and Don have a lot
of work ahead of them,

847
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:35,488
but if they contact a medium
to remove the shadow people

848
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:37,883
and the murder victim,
and a priest

849
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:40,953
to set up a boundary
banishing the priest-demon,

850
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:45,128
they can free themselves of evil
and lead a peaceful life.
