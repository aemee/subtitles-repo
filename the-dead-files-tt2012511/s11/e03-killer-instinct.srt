1
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,345
I'm seeing blood.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:17,282
He doesn't have a face anymore.

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,951
It kills me to think
that he's going

4
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,652
to have to grow up
like I did.

5
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,154
You're around
this person enough,

6
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:26,124
and you literally become insane.

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,795
He left a lot of bodies
in his wake.

8
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,663
He might have killed her.

9
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,066
All I want for my family
is to be safe.

10
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,468
I'm extremely worried.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,704
This guy wants death.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,840
This is not a good situation.

13
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,042
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,310
There's death here.

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,112
Don't want to go down there.

16
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,647
I see dead people.

17
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,682
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

18
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,285
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,921
She's definitely
a serial killer.

20
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,689
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,192
She's going to torture them.

22
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,629
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

23
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,731
They were all murdered.

24
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,433
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,802
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

27
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,505
So, is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

28
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:17,342
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,077
There's no question
in my mind

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,979
that he was talking
about Satan.

31
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,081
It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,616
Who do you think
possessed you?

33
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,384
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,353
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,754
...until the very end...

36
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,323
Well, you're not gonna
want to see this.

37
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,725
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,160
Hell no!

39
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,694
...or time to get out.

40
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,797
Everyone is in jeopardy.

41
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,480
I'm in El Cajon, California.

42
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,383
It's a blue-collar suburb
just outside of San Diego.

43
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,185
I got a call from a woman
named Melissa.

44
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,020
Now, she sounded really bad.

45
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,523
She told me she was forced
to move back into the house

46
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,091
that destroyed her childhood,

47
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,726
and now she's convinced
whatever's there

48
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,162
is going after
her 6-year-old son.

49
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,530
She really needs our help bad,

50
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,398
and I'm hoping
we can help her out.

51
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,271
Before Amy arrives,

52
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,073
I clear the house
of any leading information.

53
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,477
Photographs, artwork,

54
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,282
and religious statues
can influence her findings,

55
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,018
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,821
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

57
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,689
for tonight's walk.

58
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,472
A man is showing me

59
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:57,509
this, like,
6- to 7-foot skeleton,

60
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,511
half-burnt mess,

61
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,583
and he's, like, oozing,
dripping...stuff,

62
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,352
like, blood.

63
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,588
And he says,
"I am the great deceiver."

64
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,589
He goes, "Living are being
driven insane

65
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,060
by the madness
that surrounds them."

66
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,797
And he goes, "You think this
is crazy, you ain't seen..."

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,672
So, Melissa, when we spoke
on the phone,

68
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,407
you sounded pretty upset.

69
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,474
Yeah.

70
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,677
Especially about
your youngest son.

71
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,744
What's going on?

72
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,514
Charlie says he hears noises

73
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,551
and sees things

74
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,820
that kids --

75
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,688
You can't just
fake stuff like that.

76
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,557
How long has this been
going on with him?

77
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,227
He's lived in this house
his whole life,

78
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,328
and he started
talking to us about it

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,830
when he was like 3 or 4.

80
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,066
All right.
So who else lives in the house?

81
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,968
My grandfather. He's 85.

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,470
- Okay.
- Myself.

83
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,573
My husband, Corey.
Charlie, he is 6,

84
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,175
and Nathan, who is 16.

85
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,577
- I understand you grew up here.
- Yeah, I did.

86
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,046
And it was pretty bad
for you as a kid.

87
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,116
Yeah.
I always had experiences,

88
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,719
and they never stopped
until I left.

89
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,587
It kills me to think
that he's going

90
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,055
to have to grow up
like I did.

91
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,523
I don't want that.

92
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,993
I just don't. I want him
to have a normal childhood.

93
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,261
Why would you come back?

94
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,596
My grandmother passed away,

95
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,933
and my grandfather wasn't
doing so well on his own.

96
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,403
The only reason
why I came back.

97
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,603
Okay.

98
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,441
This is actually a picture
of her with a young Nathan.

99
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,809
What did she die of?

100
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:42,380
She had a routine back surgery
that went wrong.

101
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,017
She came home,
and two days later,

102
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,419
she went rushed back to
the hospital, and she was dead.

103
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,022
Any other history
I should know about?

104
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:54,425
I had an uncle who passed away
here as a child.

105
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,395
- As a child?
- As a child.

106
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,963
And this is your
grandfather's son?

107
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,931
- Yeah.
- You think your grandfather

108
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,700
would be willing
to talk to me?

109
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,303
We've never really
discussed it much before.

110
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,038
- Okay.
- You can try.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,840
So, Melissa, I know you guys
are going through hell here,

112
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,843
but give me an idea
or a list of what's happening.

113
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,079
Things move on their own.

114
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,781
We have fluctuating moods,

115
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,650
horrible nightmares,

116
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,120
and, like, physical attacks.

117
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,056
You mentioned mood swings.
What did you mean by that?

118
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,293
I can just get super angry
or super sad, super depressed.

119
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,661
It's just -- on a dime.

120
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,863
And I've never been
a depressed person.

121
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,197
Why don't you just
leave here, honey,

122
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,665
and take your
grandfather with you?

123
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,603
He doesn't want to go.
He's asked to die in this house.

124
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:42,073
That's his wishes.
I want to respect his wishes.

125
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,709
- Um...
- Okay.

126
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,944
He helped raise me.

127
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,480
He did so much for me,

128
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:52,951
and I want him to live
the rest of his life happy.

129
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,159
There's another man here,
and he's very sad.

130
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,629
I think he's suffering
from severe depression.

131
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,098
You know, all he does
is sit in a ball

132
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,834
and...cry all the...time.

133
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,771
So he is definitely
filling the location

134
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,409
with this despair and heaviness.

135
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,711
The living here
would feel depressed,

136
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,113
thoughts of suicide and stress,

137
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,049
so we got to get him out.

138
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,988
Okay.
So, what's going on in here?

139
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,293
In here, I've seen a full
apparition of my grandmother.

140
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,862
So, where exactly did you
see your grandmother?

141
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,464
Actually right where
I'm standing.

142
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,000
She used to be
in the kitchen a lot.

143
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,401
What else is going on?

144
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,138
We hear really loud noises
going up and down the stairway.

145
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,207
It actually sounds like
a herd of buffalo.

146
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,642
- It's very loud.
- All right.

147
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,677
You got two kids here.
How do you know it's not them?

148
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,546
Charlie sleeps with us.

149
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,882
Nathan sleeps heavy.

150
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,349
Okay.
So what else is going on?

151
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,419
Things get thrown,
like, violently thrown.

152
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,154
Like what, for instance?

153
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,923
My hairbrush
has gotten thrown

154
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,425
completely across the room
with force.

155
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,126
Okay.
Has anybody been hit by it?

156
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,963
No, but it went
about this far away

157
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,698
from the person's face.

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,500
So far, you guys have been
kind of lucky.

159
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,702
I mean, what if that caught
somebody in the eye?

160
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,737
I figure
it's a matter of time.

161
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,506
I mean, with all the stuff
going on, you got to feel like

162
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,509
- you're going out of your mind.
- I feel insane.

163
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,246
I'm seeing another guy.

164
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,514
He's crazy.

165
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,684
I think he's been in and out
of mental institutions.

166
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,752
He's usually confused and lost,

167
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,590
and he's, like, running through
the walls, throwing a fit.

168
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,392
I think that the living
can hear him,

169
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,227
and he's, like,
right up in their faces.

170
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,729
He's over them.
He's staring at them.

171
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,064
I think they would
feel that, too,

172
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,000
like, that kind of,
like, smothering.

173
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,869
They'd wake up and be like,
"What the..."

174
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,739
They know
somebody's right there.

175
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,407
He's very sick.

176
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,942
You're around
this person enough,

177
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,879
and you literally become insane.

178
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,685
Okay. Master bedroom.
This is where you sleep

179
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,687
- with your husband...
- Yeah.

180
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,521
- ...and Charlie.
- And Charlie.

181
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,890
Okay.
So what's going on?

182
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,159
Having really
bad nightmares.

183
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,227
Okay. Now, what kind
of nightmares are you having?

184
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,630
I feel like
I can't get home,

185
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,765
like there's
something very urgent,

186
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,902
and someone keeps preventing me
from coming home.

187
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,369
Anybody else having
dreams like that?

188
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,771
Charlie does.

189
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,574
He's woken up with bruises.
I have a picture

190
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,611
of when we woke him up.

191
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,913
That's not just a bruise.
I mean --

192
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,580
What about you? Are you
getting anything like this?

193
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,450
Yeah. I wake up with bruises,
scratches,

194
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,185
like burning scratches.

195
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,520
I have a picture.

196
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,589
It actually puffs up.

197
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,691
I mean, we are out in the middle
of the mountains here.

198
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,293
Any chance it could be
some kind of a rodent

199
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,995
that came in and did this to you
or anything like --

200
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,564
- No.
- Okay. What else?

201
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,933
I feel like someone
is watching me,

202
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,935
but not just watching me,

203
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:01,539
like, looming over
my face and bed.

204
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,074
- Do you see something?
- No.

205
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,143
It's just a feeling I get.

206
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,745
Okay.
Anything else going on in here?

207
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,413
I was laying in bed,

208
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,283
and I felt a hand
grab my ankle,

209
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,620
and it was a forceful grab.

210
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,490
It was so unnerving
and so scary.

211
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,692
I just --
I couldn't believe

212
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,795
it was --
that was actually happening.

213
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,163
It's a nightmare.

214
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,031
It's like
an actual nightmare.

215
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,233
I mean, does
your grandfather know

216
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,901
the sacrifice you're
making for him?

217
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,636
No.
I don't want him to know.

218
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,037
I don't want him to worry.

219
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,105
He's 85.

220
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,374
He should be
enjoying his life.

221
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,410
You know, I don't want
to see him upset.

222
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,244
I mean, he's 85.
He lived his life.

223
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,680
- Something's got to give here.
- Yeah, I agree.

224
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,683
Well, hopefully we can get
some help for you that you need.

225
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,118
Yeah.

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,319
All right.

227
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm seeing blood.

228
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,195
All right. So, skeleton dude,

229
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,931
the one I saw outside
when I first got here,

230
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,233
is with me,

231
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,469
and he's like,
"The writing's on the wall."

232
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,273
I'm so nervous.

233
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,176
Why are you here?

234
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,311
He says he was asked to be here.

235
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,813
The...would ask that?

236
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:20,352
Okay. I'm going to assume
that someone at some point here

237
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,120
...around with...

238
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,057
and somehow
pulled this dead guy here.

239
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,427
He gets physical down here --
slapping,

240
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,030
pulling, pushing,

241
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,565
tugging them
by the ankles down the bed.

242
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,902
He's like, "I'll show you.
I'll show you how...bad I am."

243
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,171
He's like,
"I have killed people."

244
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,509
So, Charlie,
let me ask you something.

245
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,245
- How old are you?
-6.

246
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,281
So, this looks like a fun room
to hang out in.

247
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,316
I mean, do you like it
in here?

248
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,517
It's scary for me.

249
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,252
It's scary?

250
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,521
You seen some bad things here?

251
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:15,190
Can you tell me
about some of them?

252
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,826
So, I've heard a noise
in the kitchen.

253
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:18,993
What kind of sound was it?

254
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,195
It was like a bang sound.

255
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,396
Okay.
How many times?

256
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,531
Three bangs.

257
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,834
- Three bangs.
- From one right here,

258
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:28,903
one in the kitchen,
and then one right next to me.

259
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,338
What else
are you experiencing?

260
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,808
I'm seeing stuff in my room.

261
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,009
Okay.
What are you seeing?

262
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,644
Black figures.

263
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,212
How often do you see that?

264
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,582
I only see it at night.

265
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,884
All right.
So, what else are you seeing?

266
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:46,020
I was, like,
just watching TV,

267
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,624
and I looked over
at a bottle,

268
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,093
and it when I was
looking at it, it moved.

269
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,796
- Where'd this happen?
- In my room.

270
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,965
Okay. So, Charlie, I know
this place is scary for you,

271
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,768
but if we could fix this,
would you like to stay here?

272
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,038
I want you to get rid of it

273
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,107
so I can sleep
in my room again.

274
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,642
Okay. That's what
we're here for.

275
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,577
We're going to try
to do that. Okay?

276
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,453
Skeleton man, he's, like,
showing me the person sleeping,

277
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,921
and he's, like,
covering their mouth

278
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:23,524
and pinching their nose.

279
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,860
He does that until

280
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,663
they, like, pass out,

281
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,031
and then he, like, lets go.

282
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,467
So a lot of walking up,
crying, being scared,

283
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,171
seeing him,
seeing him, screaming.

284
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,949
So, Corey, I was talking
to your wife, Melissa,

285
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,151
and she's really
worried about Charlie.

286
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,953
- How about you?
- I mean, what do you do

287
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,955
when your 6-year-old son
comes to you,

288
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:56,357
and he's so worried
about everything,

289
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,159
and there's nothing
I can do?

290
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:59,894
What I want most for him
is to be able

291
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,063
to, you know, have
a normal childhood.

292
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,764
She was telling me
about her grandfather.

293
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,067
Is he that stubborn
where he won't leave here?

294
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,568
There's no talking him
out of here.

295
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,837
He'll die in this house.

296
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,573
So, what experiences
have you had?

297
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:14,175
I see shadow figures
all over the house.

298
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:17,044
The one I saw was upstairs,
had white eyes,

299
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,513
and when I noticed it,

300
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,950
it was kind of sinking
into the floor.

301
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,884
Now, how often are you
seeing these things?

302
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,053
Probably at least
twice a week.

303
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,122
All right. So you're seeing
shadow figures. What else?

304
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,523
Everywhere we go
in the house,

305
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,759
it's a constant feeling
of being watched.

306
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,929
It's much heavier upstairs.

307
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,732
Is it a peeping tom thing
or somebody stalking you?

308
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,435
It's more, like, just a presence
right at your back

309
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,404
just looming over you,
watching you.

310
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,472
Anything else?

311
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:47,274
I was actually attacked
in the kitchen.

312
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,811
How?
I was standing
next to the stove.

313
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:53,581
There was a Tupperware
container on top of the fridge,

314
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,349
and it flew
across the counter

315
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,752
and hit me in the side
of the head with force.

316
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,554
- Were you alone?
- No. Nathan was with me.

317
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,222
Are you sure he didn't
do it by accident?

318
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:04,559
Yeah, he was actually
on the opposite side of me.

319
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,294
Could have been a glass jar,
God forbid.

320
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:10,264
Right.
It had very malicious intent.

321
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,433
With all the activity
you guys are experiencing,

322
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,002
it's got to be taking
a toll on you and Melissa.

323
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:17,038
Over the last few years,
seeing, like,

324
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,774
a total breakdown
in her mentally.

325
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,176
Sometimes she'll wake me up
in the middle of the night,

326
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,878
and she'll just be sobbing.

327
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,914
It just breaks my heart
to see her that way.

328
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,117
And it's just totally taking
a toll on her mental state,

329
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,719
and it's really hard
to see her go through that.

330
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,321
So, Corey, when I was
talking to your wife,

331
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:35,990
she mentioned
that the house, she feels,

332
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,125
is changing people's
personalities.

333
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,061
I definitely would agree
with her on that.

334
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,796
We go through bouts of anger,
bouts of depression,

335
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,132
and we'll kind of
start bickering

336
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,801
amongst each other
as a family.

337
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,671
When the anger comes on,
does it come on real fast,

338
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:52,607
- or does it build?
- You just go from zero to pissed

339
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:56,110
in 0.2 seconds
out of nowhere.

340
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,545
Okay.

341
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:02,450
This skeleton guy,

342
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,687
I think that he can
jump someone here,

343
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,890
and I think it's a male.

344
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,658
So when he is that way,
he is possessed.

345
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,228
There's, like, a change,
literally a physical --

346
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,830
There's some kind
of physical change

347
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:21,502
when he's inside of this person.

348
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,571
The skeleton guy goes in,

349
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,706
like, literally walk
into the guy's body...

350
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,241
...and take that energy

351
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,009
and utilize that anger.

352
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:38,019
He wants to get the dude
possessed to kill other people.

353
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,533
Melissa told me
her uncle died in the house

354
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,669
when he was just 4 years old.

355
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,104
She also told me her grandfather
never talked about it.

356
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,106
So I was a little surprised
this morning when he asked me

357
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,508
to come over
to discuss what happened.

358
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,517
Gene, I appreciate you
taking the time to talk with me.

359
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,252
I know this is
a hard subject.

360
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,588
But what can you tell me
about your little boy, Jerry?

361
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,756
He loved playing with the kids
in the neighborhood,

362
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:19,827
and he loved going to baseball
games with his brothers,

363
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,696
just a normal 4-year-old boy.

364
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,835
My God.
He was such a cute kid.

365
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,370
Yeah, he was a cute kid.

366
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:32,573
So, Gene, that day,
what exactly happened?

367
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,777
On a hot day
back in August of '67,

368
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,713
went off to work.

369
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,515
Jerry and a neighborhood
friend of his

370
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,317
were looking
for a place to play.

371
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,520
And I had my old refrigerator
in the garage.

372
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:50,090
And when the boys got in it,
I assume to cool off

373
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,959
or hide,
playing hide and seek,

374
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:56,964
the door automatically caught
when they closed the door.

375
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,600
It was an accident.

376
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,069
Okay.
So they ran out of oxygen.

377
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,370
Yeah.
They suffocated.

378
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:04,906
Okay.

379
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,907
How'd you and your wife
handle this?

380
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:11,779
As you can imagine,
she was pretty well torn up.

381
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,315
- Gene, how old are you now?
- I'm 85.

382
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:15,816
And this still sticks
with you today?

383
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,651
Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:21,055
That and my wife's
death, also.

385
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:23,390
So, Gene, how do you feel
as far as,

386
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,792
you know, your wife
and your son?

387
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,427
- You think they're here?
- I don't know about the son,

388
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,064
but my wife,
I feel she's --

389
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,999
She's been
looking after me,

390
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,801
keeping me on
the straight and narrow.

391
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,437
I think she said
she was going to haunt me.

392
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,608
- But in a good way.
- In a good way, yeah.

393
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,879
I see a woman.

394
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,148
She's in her late 40s,
early 50s.

395
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,585
I see she has long brown hair.

396
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,085
It's kind of clipped up.

397
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,487
She's wearing big glasses.

398
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,956
I think she's white,
and she is crying.

399
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,827
She was here at some point

400
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,730
and very stressed out
and hysterical.

401
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,165
I don't know what happened.

402
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,601
She's depressed,
thoughts of suicide

403
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,604
and stress.

404
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,338
She's screaming,
crying, pleading,

405
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,874
"No, no, no, not my baby."

406
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,914
So far, I've got a family being
tormented by paranormal activity

407
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,985
on a property where two
young children suffocated.

408
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,255
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

409
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:29,924
Searching through old records,
I come across a serial killer

410
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,459
named Clyde Carl Wilkerson.

411
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:37,198
Turns out, he terrorized
the El Cajon area for years.

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,333
So I reached out to a local
true crime writer

413
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,402
who's on her way
over to meet me.

414
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:43,470
She says to this day,
no one knows exactly

415
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,472
how many people this guy killed.

416
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,547
Cathy, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

417
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,015
So, let's start
from the beginning.

418
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,184
What do we know
about this Wilkerson guy?

419
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,754
Clyde Carl Wilkerson was born
in Northern California.

420
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,623
And from day one,
he was trouble.

421
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,293
He was almost a blueprint
for becoming a serial killer.

422
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,897
At age 6, he committed arson,
was arrested for it.

423
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,368
And at age 8, he was given
psychiatric treatment.

424
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,036
I mean, that's the youngest
I've ever heard.

425
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,172
He was in and out
of mental institutions

426
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,673
most of his childhood.

427
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,311
I'm seeing the crazy guy again.

428
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:28,616
I'm in his body, and I'm looking
down a hospital corridor.

429
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,685
No, it's not a hospital.

430
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,386
It's like a psych ward.

431
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,889
I'm seeing only a few
other patients,

432
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,725
and I would say
this is the 1940s or '50s.

433
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:42,262
He's strapped on a...
weird table.

434
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,932
The table looks like
those tables

435
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:49,403
that they do
lethal injections on.

436
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:52,373
I know that he was at least

437
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,877
in some kind of institution
on two occasions

438
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:59,146
for his mental state.

439
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,884
All right. So, Cathy, what's
the body count with this guy?

440
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,686
Well, he was convicted
of three,

441
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,022
but he was suspected
of many more.

442
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:10,757
Okay. So we know he did three.
What about the first one?

443
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,760
On June 6, 1965,

444
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,162
just 3 miles
from your client's home,

445
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,632
Cheryl Burnett got home
at 3:00 a.m. in the morning

446
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,701
from bowling with friends.
She was 19 years old.

447
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,637
Her toddler was sleeping
in the bedroom.

448
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,139
And Wilkerson broke in
through a window

449
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,575
and ended up raping her

450
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:29,043
and then strangling her

451
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,412
- with a drapery cord.
- All right.

452
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,180
Does he get arrested
then for that murder?

453
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,582
Not then for that murder,

454
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,184
but he was always
in trouble with the law.

455
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,189
Okay.
What about the second one?

456
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,591
This one was just a mile
from your client's home.

457
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,527
About two
or three weeks later,

458
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,462
a couple were getting
ready for bed.

459
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,364
Wilkerson goes into
the apartment building

460
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:53,401
and starts beating on the couple
with a crescent wrench.

461
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:57,004
He beat them so badly
that he killed the husband.

462
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,941
Does he kill the wife,
as well?

463
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:04,645
He raped the wife and left her
for dead, but she survived.

464
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,079
Okay.
Was she able to identify him?

465
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:08,148
She was unable to.

466
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,084
Okay. So now we got two murders
a couple weeks apart.

467
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:11,351
When's the third one happen?

468
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,522
Third one doesn't happen
until 1975.

469
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,490
Okay.
So it's 1975. What happened?

470
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,493
Wilkerson ends up going
to Tulsa, Oklahoma,

471
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,294
breaks into an apartment,

472
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,565
and rapes and murders

473
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,234
28-year-old college student
Geraldine Martin.

474
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,969
All right. So we got three
homicides we know he did.

475
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:29,971
How did they catch him?

476
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,340
Three letters -- DNA.

477
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:36,076
The El Cajon Police Department,
they grabbed him in 2002.

478
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,045
I can only imagine there's got
to be a lot more.

479
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,981
I think he left a lot
of bodies in his wake.

480
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,850
Okay.
So is this guy still alive?

481
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:45,386
No. He died in 2016

482
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,655
at age 77 of an illness.

483
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:50,391
He died in prison.

484
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,725
So, there's this woman,

485
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,527
and it's a beautiful day out,

486
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,863
and it's 1978.

487
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:58,665
The crazy guy,
he's watching her.

488
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,034
And they're at the beach.

489
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:04,438
And so I was like,
"Did he do something to her?"

490
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,407
He might have killed her.

491
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,409
He says he's very lost
and confused.

492
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,477
He's very sick.

493
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,879
Do you know how he died?

494
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:15,749
I don't know.
Dementia, maybe a stroke.

495
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,553
He said they
scrambled his brain.

496
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:23,057
And he says, "I ruined
everything, everything."

497
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,992
And then I know he's dead, too.

498
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,035

504
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,773
You know, another thing
caught my eye in research.

505
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,843
The day after the attacks
on Pearl Harbor,

506
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,579
the military took over
a bunch of land in the area,

507
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,647
including Melissa
and Corey's property.

508
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,516
I'm heading over to meet
with a military expert,

509
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,918
who says there was
a deadly accident on the site

510
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,753
I definitely want to know about.

511
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,495
Well, Sergeant Major,
thanks for meeting with me.

512
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:20,197
You mentioned on the phone
that the military

513
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,132
basically just took over
my client's property

514
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,667
right after
the Pearl Harbor attack.

515
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,734
Now, was that common?

516
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,436
It was very common
on the West Coast.

517
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,738
The Army came in.

518
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,773
The federal government
seized the property.

519
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,542
All right. So I know my client's
house wasn't built yet,

520
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,009
but who owned
the property back then?

521
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,946
This was a farm owned by
a gentleman named Ed Fletcher.

522
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,615
So what'd they wind up
doing with the property?

523
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,551
The property became an army camp
known as Camp La Mesa,

524
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,987
and by the way,
I have some pictures here

525
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,990
of what the camp looked like
at the early part of the war

526
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,258
and then later when
they actually built buildings.

527
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,693
Had a pretty big setup,
didn't they?

528
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,229
It was an infantry
regiment of 1,400 men.

529
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,364
So, you mentioned on the phone,
there was a pretty bad accident

530
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,565
I'm going to want
to know about.

531
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,068
Yeah, on April 24, 1942,

532
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,571
there was mortar training.

533
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,239
That's what the weapon
looks like.

534
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,607
Okay.
I'm familiar with this.

535
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,777
And one of the rounds
exploded in the tube.

536
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,480
Ooh. Now, how bad
was this explosion?

537
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:13,384
It killed five men instantly.
One died in hospital.

538
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,118
-16 were wounded.
- Okay.

539
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,021
So were there any other deaths
that I should know about?

540
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,258
Not that I'm aware of,
but here at Gillespie Field,

541
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,694
which bordered
Ed Fletcher's property,

542
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:27,731
there's been 24 people killed
in 13 separate accidents.

543
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,133
Okay.
So that's a lot deaths.

544
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,535
I don't want to go through all
of them, but did any stand out?

545
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,070
Yeah, two of them
really stood out.

546
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,539
In January of 1981,

547
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,542
a 15-year-old
by the name of Grant Thompson

548
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,944
talked his mother,
his stepfather,

549
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,515
and two of their friends
into flying to Las Vegas.

550
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,051
Never mind that he had
never flown a plane before.

551
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,487
So these four adults got
on a plane with a 15-year-old,

552
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,157
- and this kid never flew.
- That's correct.

553
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,591
Okay.
What the hell happened?

554
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,294
The plane never got
off the ground. It crashed.

555
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,897
All were killed aboard.

556
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,364
Okay. That was
a pretty bad accident.

557
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,466
What about the second one?

558
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,969
The second one was
a Navy F-14 Tomcat

559
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,039
flying out of Naval Air
Station Miramar in San Diego.

560
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,242
It encountered
mechanical problems,

561
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,910
and the air crew
had to eject.

562
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,381
Upon ejection, one of
the air crew broke his neck.

563
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,650
All right. So do we know
how he broke his neck?

564
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,252
The plane
was out of control.

565
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:23,987
It was upside down
when they ejected,

566
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,389
and he broke his neck
somewhere in that process.

567
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,992
- Okay.
- Now, the plane did travel on

568
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,494
and crashed here
on the airfield.

569
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,664
It injured three people.

570
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,934
It destroyed $6 to $9 million
worth of airport property.

571
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:40,270
Have you ever seen this much
death on one airfield before?

572
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,538
Not that I'm aware of.

573
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,407
- It's, like, bad luck over here.
- It's quite bizarre.

574
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,882
I'm seeing
the skeleton dude in here.

575
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,450
Do you know how he died?

576
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:57,621
I see blood, and I feel
like he had a bad death.

577
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,723
He's, like,
dripping and melting.

578
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,163
I know his neck got broken.

579
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,232
I mean, he looks a little burnt.

580
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,443
I saw several dead people
during my walk,

581
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,979
but the skeleton man
tormenting a child

582
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,381
had me the most concerned.

583
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,116
There's this dead guy

584
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:30,120
who doesn't really
have any clothes on.

585
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,789
There were definitely
a lot of areas

586
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,527
on his body and face
that were burned.

587
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:41,998
And there was a child in a bed,

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,203
and he has his hands
on the kid's face,

589
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,940
over the mouth
and pinching the nose.

590
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,446
Amy, is this what you saw?

591
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,414
Yes.

592
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,471
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

593
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,606
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

594
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,008
and our clients
for the first time.

595
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,778
So, Amy, this is Melissa
and her husband, Corey.

596
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,213
Now, Melissa grew up
in this house

597
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,582
and had a miserable time here.

598
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,751
But she has a huge heart.

599
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,453
She moved her entire family
back here

600
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,492
to take care of her 85-year-old
grandfather, Gene.

601
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,894
This is her 16-year-old son,
Nathan,

602
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,230
and this is Charlie, who's 6.

603
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,966
Now, he's the reason we're here.

604
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,267
Kid's having a rough time,

605
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,635
and Melissa is scared

606
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,438
his childhood's going to be
ruined just like hers was.

607
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,840
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

608
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,042
I'll ask her describe
her walk for us.

609
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:05,449
The first thing that I got
was a deceased female.

610
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,250
She's white, and I got

611
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,686
that she was in her late 40s,
early 50s.

612
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,489
I also got
that she was living here

613
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,592
around 1980s or early 1990s.

614
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,594
She spent most of her time
in the kitchen

615
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,864
and dining area,
which is where she is still.

616
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,934
I saw her in a very bad state.

617
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,369
She was hysterically crying.

618
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,806
She was extremely depressed.

619
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,140
She's very stressed out.

620
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,744
She was screaming,
"No, no, no, not my baby."

621
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,279
Now, Melissa lost her
grandmother about 10 years ago?

622
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,416
Yeah. Well, you just
described her, basically.

623
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,752
You told me you saw your
grandmother's apparition

624
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:42,952
- in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

625
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,089
And I could tell you
exactly what she was wearing.

626
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,757
And we just looked
at each other.

627
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,292
It scared me.

628
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:51,228
So, why are you
afraid of her?

629
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,763
She was a strict woman.

630
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,664
She tried to teach me
how to be a lady.

631
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,501
And, you know,
she had a lot of kids.

632
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,570
And she lost her
youngest child here.

633
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,340
Okay.
You should know about
Melissa's uncle, Jerry.

634
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,608
He died in the garage
when he was 4 years old.

635
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,578
On August 30, 1967, Jerry
was playing with another kid

636
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,313
in the neighborhood
who was 3 years old,

637
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,317
and they walked into a fridge
that was in the garage.

638
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,086
The door locked on them,
and they suffocated.

639
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,122
I got a photo of Jerry.
He was a really cute kid, too.

640
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,863
Now, I actually have a picture
of Melissa's grandmother.

641
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,200
Is it possible
this is who you saw?

642
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,636
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

643
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,438
Do you think she ever
got over Jerry passing?

644
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,839
No.

645
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,344
It's kind of hard to think that,
you know, she hasn't moved past.

646
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:45,215
That's what's hard for me
right now to accept.

647
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,154
Okay.
So what else?

648
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:56,059
So there's two other dead people
who are very present,

649
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,562
and I'm concerned about them.

650
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,933
The first individual has mental
disorders, mental illness.

651
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,968
He's definitely nuts.

652
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,704
I do think that he would
affect the living.

653
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,440
I thought maybe some of you
would hear him,

654
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,709
because he does get
a little worked up,

655
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,513
and so he'll start banging
things, throwing things.

656
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,649
I was attacked
in the kitchen.

657
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,251
There was a Tupperware
on top of the fridge,

658
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,052
and it flew
across the counter

659
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:26,256
and hit me with force
in the side of the head.

660
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,458
- Wow.
- When I spoke to Charlie,

661
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,229
he told me that he hears
a lot of things banging,

662
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,596
scratching noises.

663
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,133
He doesn't sleep downstairs.

664
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,134
- Okay.
- He hasn't for over a year.

665
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,070
He sleeps with us.

666
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,538
Okay.

667
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,607
The other thing that unnerved me

668
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,510
was that he does watch,

669
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,813
and he stares,
and he'll get right in your face

670
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,816
and do this.

671
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:56,653
Being subjected to him
consistently

672
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,823
can make you feel
like you're going insane.

673
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,393
Actually, that's part of the
reason why I called you guys.

674
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,428
Sometimes I can't go to sleep

675
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,564
because I feel like somebody's
pacing on my side of the bed,

676
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,300
back and forth,
back and forth,

677
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:14,705
and that he leans over
and is right in my face.

678
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,508
I've spent whole nights
just crying

679
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,779
because it feels
so intrusive.

680
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,914
Any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

681
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:29,519
What I was able to get from him
was that he had been

682
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,022
in and out
of mental institutions,

683
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:35,792
and I was getting the 1940s,
1950s with him,

684
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:39,930
and he was showing me

685
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,632
that he's on a beach.
He's looking out.

686
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,169
There's a young,
attractive woman.

687
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,071
It was 1978.

688
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,341
I believe he killed her.

689
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,743
Wow. It's interesting, 'cause
the stuff you're talking about

690
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,614
reminds me of a serial killer
that terrorized the city.

691
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,183
Now, the guy's name
is Clyde Carl Wilkerson.

692
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,085
This kid was bad news
from the start.

693
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,954
Wilkerson was arrested
for arson at the age of 6.

694
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,989
Then he was in and out
of mental hospitals

695
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,358
starting at the age of 8.

696
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,760
Holy...

697
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,429
Now, you mentioned
mental institutions

698
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,864
in the '40s and '50s.

699
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,066
Now, Wilkerson was born in '38,

700
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,235
so the time frame matches.

701
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,904
Unfortunately, in the '60s,
he started killing.

702
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,307
In 1965, he beat, strangled,
and raped a 19-year-old girl

703
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,775
a couple of miles from here

704
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,845
while her 2-year-old son
slept in the other room.

705
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,513
A few weeks later,
this sick bastard

706
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,582
breaks into
an older couple's house

707
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,685
less than a mile from here.

708
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,186
He beats the man to death.

709
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,524
Then he raped and badly beat
his wife, leaving her for dead.

710
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:43,259
She survived. Barely, though.

711
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,062
She was never right again
and couldn't identify him.

712
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,765
Now, in 1975, he struck again.

713
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,734
Now, this time, his victim
was a 28-year-old student

714
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,536
named Geraldine Martin.

715
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,005
He wound up raping
and murdering her, too.

716
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,709
This guy may have killed more,
but that's all they got him on.

717
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,378
Now, he wasn't
arrested until 2002.

718
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,815
Holy...

719
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,652
I got a great mug shot
array of him

720
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,921
from when he was younger
to when he was older.

721
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,992
Now, what do you think?
Is this who you might have seen?

722
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,360
Yes.

723
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,896
This just blows
my -- my mind.

724
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,064
And when did he die?

725
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,100
Last year.

726
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,004
Everything started happening
about a year ago here,

727
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,707
like, real bad.

728
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,108
That makes me
totally disgusted.

729
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,677
I don't want this guy
around my kid.

730
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,981
I agree.

731
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:43,052
The next guy that I encountered,
I felt, was the bigger threat.

732
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,722
The way he showed himself
was extremely disturbing.

733
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,525
He looked like a skeleton,
and it looked like

734
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,996
he had burns all over his body.

735
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,366
And this skeleton guy

736
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,734
was not a good person in life.

737
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,638
He said that he did kill people.

738
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,340
Because of how he looked,

739
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,009
I believe he had
a really gruesome death,

740
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,345
and I think the thing
that killed him

741
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:12,682
- was actually a broken neck.
- I have history that I really

742
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,018
don't think has anything to do
with who she's talking about,

743
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,220
but I think it's something
you guys should know about.

744
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,156
Now, the day after
the attacks on Pearl Harbor,

745
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,559
the military came in
and enforced eminent domain

746
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,860
and took over all the property,

747
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,730
and then they created
two military bases here.

748
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,298
One camp was La Mesa.

749
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,234
The other one was right next
to your old property line,

750
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,236
and that's called
Gillespie Field now.

751
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,437
According to the expert
I talked to,

752
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:38,274
there have been
13 separate accidents there

753
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,111
that killed 24 people.

754
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,679
One stood to me was this one.

755
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:46,850
It was an F-14 in 1988
that malfunctioned

756
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,919
and began spinning
out of control.

757
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,721
When the two pilots
ejected from the airplane,

758
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,125
one of them broke
his neck upon impact.

759
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,293
Any chance one of these deaths

760
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,595
could have been
the skeleton guy you saw?

761
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,698
No. Mnh-mnh.

762
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,200
Okay. So now we have an idea
who it's not.

763
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,936
So why is this skeleton guy
such a big threat?

764
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,672
When I first got here,
he told me

765
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:11,608
that he causes pain and death.

766
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,844
He did get physical with me
a couple of times,

767
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,747
and I do believe
that he's very capable

768
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,884
of becoming physical
with living people.

769
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:25,422
One of the things that I saw
and felt this skeleton guy does

770
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:28,425
is, like, slapping and pushing

771
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:31,361
and hitting people.

772
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,164
The other thing I saw
was he was wrapping his hands

773
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,499
around the bottom
of the feet and the ankles

774
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,269
and pulling them out of bed.

775
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,505
Tell Amy what happened.

776
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,975
I was laying there,
and I got a grab on my ankle,

777
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,776
a real tight grab.

778
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,078
- Really?
- And it scared me to death.

779
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,114
Well, you even wake up
with scratches and bruises.

780
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,515
- Yeah.
- Okay.

781
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,452
Lookit. Here's one of the
scratches she took pictures of.

782
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,452
Wow.

783
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,854
That's, like, nothing.

784
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:01,524
And matter of fact,
Charlie wakes up

785
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,794
with bruises on him.

786
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,630
Yeah, I know.

787
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,803
Okay. So, the other thing
that I saw him doing

788
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,873
was possessing
a living male here.

789
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,811
He can enter the body
and take over

790
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,381
and completely change
his personality,

791
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,884
and that would be becoming
angry and violent.

792
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:32,355
I go from zero to angry
in 0.5 seconds.

793
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,758
Do you notice, when he does
that, any physical changes?

794
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,627
Yes. If we're fighting,

795
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,364
he has this specific face
where he looks at me,

796
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,902
almost like a disgust,
the way he squints his eyes.

797
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,172
The other thing
that I saw him doing was,

798
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,640
we went into the little room,

799
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,308
- the little blue room.
- Yep, yep.

800
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,177
And that blue room's
Charlie's room, right?

801
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,013
It's the one
he won't sleep in.

802
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,450
And what I saw
was very disturbing.

803
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:04,387
I did have a sketch done of what
I saw happening in there.

804
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,530
Jesus.

805
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:21,004
I don't even want
to show it to them.

806
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,405
My gosh.

807
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,747
I want to say that it's
a surprising picture,

808
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,451
but the way he thrashes
around at night.

809
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,754
He's always saying,
"No. Stop. Get away."

810
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,356
So what's he doing
in this picture?

811
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,890
He was trying to smother him.

812
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:44,394
He was covering his mouth,
pinching his nose.

813
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:49,966
Obviously, he's trying
to kill your child.

814
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,837
I did get that sometimes
the kid would wake up

815
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,405
and would actually
see him in his room,

816
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,775
and he was crying,
and it scares him.

817
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,113
That's just...disgusting.
That pisses me off to no end.

818
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,450
I can't -- I mean --

819
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:11,054
Yeah.
I don't even have any words.

820
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,256
I'm extremely,
extremely worried,

821
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:16,860
because this guy wants death,

822
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:20,997
and he wants to be able
to jump the living male here

823
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,132
and have basically, you know,

824
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,404
a murder-suicide
kind of situation.

825
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,871
He showed me
where he enters you.

826
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,675
He said it's on your
right side right here.

827
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:36,279
I get rib pain on that side
all the time.

828
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,615
I don't even know
what to say to you guys.

829
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,217
This is bad.

830
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,954
This is -- It is. Bad.

831
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,691
Would I be able to just,
like, have just maybe

832
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,492
- a minute or two?
- Yeah.

833
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,244
Now, Melissa, you called us in

834
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,514
because you wanted us
to save your son.

835
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,585
But as it turns out,
your entire family is in danger.

836
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,187
And I know taking care
of your grandfather

837
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,190
means everything to you,
but I don't know how

838
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,424
you're going to be able
to do that here safely.

839
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,794
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

840
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,868
So, I'm very worried.

841
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,672
My suggestion is that you leave
as soon as possible.

842
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,311
You guys need to put
a lot of distance

843
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,381
between here and where you go.

844
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,053
But before entering
a new place of residence,

845
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,123
you need to have a male

846
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,792
who is a psychic
and a reiki master,

847
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,196
because this skeleton guy,

848
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:04,667
he showed me that he has entered
you on several occasions.

849
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,571
There could be cords there.

850
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,639
And the psychic reiki master

851
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,777
will be doing a cord removal
and cutting.

852
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,080
This can be painful,

853
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,383
but you'll feel so much better
after it's done.

854
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,251
Now, what about Charlie?

855
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,723
Other than obviously
removing him from this location,

856
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:31,027
he is clear right now.

857
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,863
Now, what about Melissa? Does
she have to do anything, or --

858
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,002
No. Mnh-mnh.

859
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,937
What are the chances
Gene's going to come with you,

860
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,772
your grandfather?

861
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,073
I don't think
they're very high.

862
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,877
I'll try to get him
to come with us, but...

863
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,080
I don't know that
he's going to want to go.

864
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,282
You said something to me
the other day

865
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,285
that I thought about
for a long time.

866
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,821
He's 85, and he has
lived his life,

867
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,191
and my son hasn't, so...

868
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,893
So, the main thing is,
you called us in for Charlie.

869
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,161
So my question to you is,
if they move

870
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,197
and they do everything
you tell them to do,

871
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,233
this kid should have
a normal life, Charlie?

872
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,101
Yes,
as long as y'all do

873
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,903
everything I'm telling you
to do.

874
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,605
I had already
made up my mind

875
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,506
if it was going to be something
like this

876
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,843
- that we were going to leave.
- Absolutely. We're gone.

877
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,613
The kids come first,

878
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:27,750
and they got to have
a normal childhood.

879
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,320
The only way this family
can remain safe

880
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:33,522
is to move as far away
as possible.

881
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,125
They also need to contact
a psychic reiki master

882
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,527
to break Corey's
negative attachments.

883
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,931
If they do that, they can leave
the skeleton man behind

884
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,733
and begin a peaceful life
somewhere else.
