1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,544
There's blood all over
the walls.

2
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,313
This is a nightmare.

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,647
He's crazy.

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,249
I don't feel good.

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,650
I hate being in my home.

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,953
I think that it can cause death.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,990
We did mess around
with the Ouija board.

8
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,927
Somebody is doing Ouija board

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,831
and has somehow
summoned these things.

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,533
You're busted.
Forget about it.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,035
Never seen such interaction

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,173
between a living person
and a shadow person before.

13
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,709
This is not a good situation.

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,577
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,179
There's death here.

16
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,914
Don't wanna go down there.

17
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,182
I see dead people.

18
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,284
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

19
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,953
I speak to dead people...

20
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,756
She's definitely
a serial killer.

21
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,558
...and they speak to me.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,727
She's going to torture them.

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,531
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

24
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,666
They were all murdered.

25
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,168
I rely on my partner.

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,736
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

27
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,538
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,240
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

29
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,811
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

30
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:22,881
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

31
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,583
It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,218
Who do you think
possessed you?

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,387
But Steve and I
never speak...

34
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,422
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,657
...until the very end.

36
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,292
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

37
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,360
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

38
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,862
<i>Hell,</i> no.

39
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,530
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,532
Everyone is in jeopardy.

41
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,715
I'm in Berthoud, Colorado.

42
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,084
It's a small town
an hour north of Denver.

43
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,686
I got a call from a woman
named Rebecca.

44
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,022
Now, she sounded hysterical,
says whatever's in the house

45
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,624
is killing her
from the inside-out,

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,125
and there's nothing she can
do about it

47
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,595
because it follows her
wherever she goes.

48
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,463
I really hope we can
help her out.

49
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,003
Before Amy arrives,

50
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,973
I clear the area
of any leading information --

51
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,942
photographs, personal items,

52
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,980
and even religion statues
need to be covered or removed.

53
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,149
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,392
I don't feel good.

55
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,630
I usually open myself
to communicate with the dead

56
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,534
a few hours before I get
to a location,

57
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,436
but tonight, I'm very sick
and vulnerable...

58
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,375
...so I'm opening
inside the house.

59
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,249
I'm, like, seeing blood.

60
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,518
There's blood all over
the walls.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,556
It looks very dreamlike.

62
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,224
This woman's screaming
and crying,

63
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,293
and this is a nightmare.

64
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,768
You know, Rebecca, I talk
to a lot of scared people,

65
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,338
and when we spoke, I can hear
the desperation in your voice.

66
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,173
I hate being in my home.

67
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,008
You look upset already.

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,577
- You okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,146
Okay.

70
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,247
I got to ask a question.

71
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,481
I mean, why don't you
just leave?

72
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,318
I feel like whatever is here
is attached to me.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,353
Whatever it is,
it's going to follow me.

74
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,322
Okay, So now,
do you live here alone?

75
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,390
I live with my mom,
and I have a boyfriend

76
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,026
that frequently
spends the night here.

77
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,261
How long
have you lived here?

78
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,862
I grew up here,
and I've lived here

79
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,497
off and on throughout
my adult life.

80
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,266
Your family
bought this house?

81
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,068
We built it in 1984.

82
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,637
I mean, when did the activity
start getting really bad?

83
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,806
It got bad
about 2 years ago.

84
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,275
What do you think
is causing all of this?

85
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,911
A lot of fracking
started in this area.

86
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,245
Is that close by?

87
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,647
- It's very close...
- Okay.

88
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,048
...like, within a mile.

89
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,817
Now, you guys have been
here over 30 years.

90
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,386
Do you know any history
in the area?

91
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,854
There was a deadly car crash

92
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,490
just across the streets
about 12 years ago.

93
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,592
All right.
So I'll look into that.

94
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,494
Anybody that passed away
in the house, stuff like that?

95
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,696
My dad passed away here
about 6 months ago.

96
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,831
- He was 82.
- Okay.

97
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,766
What did he pass from?

98
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,067
Kidney failure.

99
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,602
Now did he pass away
in the house?

100
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,939
Not in the house. He left
the house in an ambulance

101
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,375
and died about 2 weeks later
in hospice.

102
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,978
This was my dad probably
about 15...years ago?

103
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,113
Okay.

104
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:45,083
And this is a picture
of my dad and me.

105
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,185
What can you tell me
about your father?

106
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,454
He suffered for a long time
with depression.

107
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,590
He was affected
by something here.

108
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,359
He used to talk about
people coming to visit.

109
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,128
So you think he was suffering
from, like, paranormal

110
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,597
that was going on here and
didn't know how to deal with it?

111
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,032
I think so.

112
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,800
Have you done anything to combat
what you've been through?

113
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:06,238
I've had people come to do
cleansings, exorcism.

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,173
We had a demonologist
come out.

115
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,641
That's quite a list
right there.

116
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,709
And nothing has helped?

117
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,944
Just for
a short period of time.

118
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,179
I know you have a lot
going on, Rebecca,

119
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,381
but give me a list
of what's happening.

120
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,985
Hearing noises,
seeing weird things.

121
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,887
It's become very violent,

122
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,756
and I think my personality
has changed.

123
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,124
Okay, in what way?

124
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,027
I used to be really easygoing,
very happy all the time,

125
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,098
and now I'm filled with anxiety
and overly sensitive,

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,801
kind of turned into a...

127
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,302
tension between
me and my mom,

128
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,837
tension between
me and my boyfriend.

129
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,173
And what do you hope
we can do for you?

130
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,642
I'd like to be comfortable
in my home.

131
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,877
I'd like to not
be getting hurt anymore.

132
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,345
Yeah.

133
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:57,823
The only thing about this area
is the, like, the energy chaos.

134
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,959
This is all, like,
living energy stuff, you know?

135
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,796
A male and a female arguing.

136
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,799
The energy here is very, um,

137
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,202
hectic and chaotic.

138
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,472
It's too much noise.

139
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,713
Okay. So, Rebecca,
what's going on in here?

140
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,014
Coming into the hall,

141
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,951
I felt something push me
on my left shoulder,

142
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,919
so I turned to see

143
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,288
and just so quickly

144
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,591
went backwards over this,

145
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,926
and left me with bruises
and scratches on my back.

146
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,862
I mean, that's -- that's
a pretty high opening.

147
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,097
That had to be
a pretty strong push.
Yep.

148
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,866
Thank God there's no glass
in between here.

149
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,834
Yeah.
All right,
so what else is going on?

150
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,670
Just last night, I was
walking down the stairs.

151
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,272
Something pushed me
from behind,

152
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,841
and I fell down the stairs,
hurt my shoulder.

153
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,143
I mean, I hate to be an ass,

154
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,844
but, I mean,
are you clumsy at all?

155
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,914
Not clumsy enough to make
stuff like this happen.

156
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,583
And you wonder why your anxiety
is through the roof.

157
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,586
I just feel like
a walking target

158
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,789
all the time.

159
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,725
Just...I felt sexually
assaulted in my bed.

160
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:10,862
Okay. All right. Has this
happened more than once?

161
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,497
No, just one time.

162
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,933
It's a lot more violent
than we thought.

163
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,536
Okay. I'm really glad
I took this case.

164
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,970
Thank you.

165
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,710
I'm seeing a shadow person
in here.

166
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,612
I think it's
a real shadow person,

167
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,249
and I see it attacking
the person in here.

168
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,451
Usually, shadow people
are just all, like,

169
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,921
suck the life out of you.

170
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,991
This is, like, physically
assaulting this person.

171
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,297
Yeah, I see a female
with brown hair.

172
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,098
She's probably...

173
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,735
I don't know,
in her 30s, average build.

174
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,804
Like, I see a person laying.

175
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,075
The shadow person is, like,
on its hands and feet,

176
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,610
and it's<i> huge.</i>

177
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,047
It becomes huge,
and the person's like...

178
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,548
like, underneath it.

179
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,189
You know, Rebecca,
after everything
you've told me so far,

180
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,657
I'm afraid to even ask.

181
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,925
What else is going on?

182
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,028
I have seen
a black creature, like,

183
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,731
with lots of long tentacles
all over it.

184
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,299
Shiny black,

185
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,836
no face to speak of.

186
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,005
How big of a mass are
we talking about? Like this?

187
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,074
Probably 4 feet.

188
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,309
You on any medication
or anything?
No.

189
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,011
So nothing that's making
you hallucinate?

190
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,246
No.

191
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,547
Okay. Anything else
going on in here?

192
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,049
I've gotten scratches
and bruises in bed.

193
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,252
Okay. What kind of scratches and
bruises are we talking about?

194
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,786
Well, I have some pictures.

195
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,689
Here's a picture
of some scratches.

196
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,092
Jeez.

197
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,226
I see there's blood here.

198
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,895
I mean, I've seen cats
in the house.

199
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,962
Cats come into bed
with you guys?

200
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,998
Cats go in their
own room at night.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,165
All right. Anything else?

202
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,867
One time,
I was laying in bed,

203
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,703
and I felt like
I was punched in the face,

204
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,539
and it was so hard that I had
a tooth knocked out.

205
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,608
Which tooth was it?

206
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,343
Um, this one, right here.

207
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,848
It's insane.
I feel crazy sometimes.

208
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,483
You have a tough go here.

209
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,158
There's a lot of interaction
between this shadow person

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,860
and this living person.

211
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,195
This is a pretty much
every night thing,

212
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,265
dragging them off the bed,

213
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,669
being pushed,
pushed down to the floor,

214
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,537
trying to take them
through the walls,

215
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,572
which doesn't work
if you're alive.

216
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,208
Wouldn't be surprised
if there would be bruises

217
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,411
from being grabbed
and moved and dropped.

218
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:44,683
I've never seen such interaction
between a living person

219
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:48,186
and a shadow person before.

220
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:52,424
I'm feeling frustration from
the shadow person,

221
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,292
almost like the shadow person

222
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:59,197
thinks this person
is another shadow person

223
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,301
and isn't doing what
they're supposed to be doing.

224
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:08,606
This is very odd behavior
from an actual shadow person.

225
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,709
So would you say
this person is in danger?

226
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,745
Yes. I think that...

227
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:19,551
maybe the shadow person
will figure out a way

228
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:23,021
to make this person disappear.

229
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,559
So, Heidi, I know
you're friends with Rebecca.

230
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,994
How long you guys been friends?

231
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,462
Since I can remember.

232
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:48,897
You told me you didn't want
to do the interview inside.

233
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,165
What was that all about?

234
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,800
I recently lost my husband,

235
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,401
and I'm kind of
in a vulnerable place,

236
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,702
and I just want
to protect myself

237
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,938
from taking something home
with me.

238
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,507
So, obviously, you think
there's something in the house.

239
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,843
- Yeah.
- Have you had any experiences?

240
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,279
- I have.
- Okay. Let's talk about them.

241
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,648
When we were little,
we used to see a guy

242
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,617
walking around in her barn
sometimes.

243
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,953
Okay. So how do you know
it wasn't some guy in the barn?

244
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:14,889
- We would go in and look.
- Okay.

245
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,057
Could they have been hiding
when he saw you coming?

246
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,193
No. There was really
nowhere to hide.

247
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,794
Okay. So anything else?

248
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,163
There was one other thing
that was sort of

249
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,598
like an impish
little creature.

250
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,902
It was black and white and had
sort of, like, long pointy head.

251
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,872
Describe him to me like it's
a perpetrator from a crime.

252
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,842
- Foot and a half tall, maybe.
- Okay.

253
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,109
Small mouth, sharp teeth...

254
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,344
...big eyes.

255
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,645
So like a little monster,
really?

256
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,481
Yeah, kind of.
Well, let me ask you
a question.

257
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,249
Do you think your friend
is in danger?

258
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,350
I do.

259
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,819
I'm hoping you guys
can help her.

260
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,658
I see a demon.

261
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,929
Can you describe him?

262
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:58,433
There's no, like, real body,

263
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,635
but it has legs and arms.

264
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,470
It slithers, mostly...

265
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,977
...and it has a fat trunk
that's really long,

266
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,112
and it slithers like a snake
on that.

267
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:14,382
Its head is kind of like
a...triangular.

268
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:18,653
It has, like, some kind of
ear things or something,

269
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,958
and it has a weird, like, snout
and big yellow eyes.

270
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,828
I think that we've got
a problem.

271
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,470
You know, Linda,
I was talking to Rebecca.

272
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,738
You gotta be worried
about her.

273
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm extremely worried
about her.

274
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,110
I don't know how much more
she can handle.

275
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,013
So, Linda, I understand that
your husband recently passed.

276
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,614
Do you think he's here?

277
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:50,818
I feel he's here, but I feel
it's not a negative influence.

278
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,154
All right, as far as
experiences, what about you?

279
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:57,392
Every time that I sit
in the chair behind me,

280
00:12:57,394 --> 00:13:00,395
I feel like someone
is sitting on my chest

281
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,397
and I cannot catch
my breath.

282
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,865
Okay. Listen.

283
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,199
I know it's a lot to ask,
but can you sit in the chair?

284
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,267
I'm just curious
if it would happen

285
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,670
with me being in the room
with you.

286
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:10,171
Of course.

287
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,177
I don't feel good.

288
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,947
Is it
the same pressure feeling?

289
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,481
Yes.

290
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,016
It is.

291
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,217
This quick?

292
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,821
- Okay. All right.
- It is.

293
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:29,791
All right. Come on. Come on.

294
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,925
Sorry about that. I just
wanted to see. You okay?

295
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,160
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

296
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,628
- It's okay.
- You feel better now?

297
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,396
- Yeah. I do.
- Okay.

298
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,498
That's why I don't spend
any time in here.

299
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,033
Anything else?

300
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:43,204
At night, we hear
very definite scratching

301
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,672
in the outside wall.

302
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,940
You got wildlife
all over the place.

303
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,275
We do.

304
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,612
Pest control people came out
and checked everything.

305
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:52,447
They even went under
the house.

306
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,382
Now you've lived here
a very long time,

307
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,085
but I understand that
this stuff got pretty intense

308
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,219
over the last couple
of years.

309
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:59,487
All right, so what
do you think changed?

310
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:03,391
Rebecca's boyfriend dabbled
in Ouija boards,

311
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:06,894
and I really wonder
if that opened a door

312
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,998
to some negative
occurrences here.

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,232
Well, we're here,
so hopefully,

314
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,467
we'll get some answers
for you guys.

315
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,968
I hope so.

316
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:21,075
Okay. So this is weird.

317
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,679
The demon is, like,
storming in the house,

318
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:28,716
and it's, like, making
a lot of noise and ruckus.

319
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:33,388
I was being told that
a living person here

320
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,623
has collected this thing.

321
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,393
- The demon?
- Yes.

322
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,329
I just assumed it came
from the land, you know?

323
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:44,365
But, mnh-mnh, no,
somebody here...

324
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,068
I'm getting a male.

325
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,104
What the...are they doing,
making a demon come on up?

326
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:54,609
Something is gonna happen,

327
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,877
like a murder.

328
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,419
So, Mike,
talking to Rebecca,

329
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:06,287
I mean, she's going
through hell here.

330
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,855
You gotta be worried
about her.

331
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:08,890
I'm sickened by it.

332
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,059
It just makes you feel
helpless.

333
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,261
Now Rebecca told me
that no matter where she goes,

334
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,495
this thing follows her.

335
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,230
Now have you seen this
happen at your place?

336
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,398
Absolutely.

337
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
This one time, she was choked.

338
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,736
She's been thrown
against my closet door.

339
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,271
She's been thrown into
my bathtub.

340
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:26,174
She's been thrown off
the back of my couch.

341
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,577
Actually, I've got, like,
three journals like this,

342
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,646
just account after account

343
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,682
of things that have
happened to her.

344
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,751
Now when I talked to Linda,
her mom.

345
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,853
She's been here since 1984.

346
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,855
And she said none
of this violent...started

347
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,056
until you came into
the picture.

348
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:44,058
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- So...

349
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,927
Well, I mean, we did mess around
with a Ouija board,

350
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,862
and we've went on
a couple ghost tours.

351
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,363
So you only did those
two things, and that's it?

352
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,399
Yeah, Ouija board, EVP,
and, yeah, ghost tour.

353
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,167
- So that's three things.
- Three things, yeah.

354
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:55,903
Now you understand,
if you we sit down with Amy,

355
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,839
she's going to want to know
everything.

356
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:59,340
And if you're not
telling me all of it,

357
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,876
it's not going to help
our case here.

358
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,213
We have contacted
a demonologist,

359
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:08,316
a Reiki Master,
and then another psychic.

360
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,152
All right, so there<i> were</i>
other things that went on here.

361
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:14,622
The truth is, it doesn't matter
where Becca goes.

362
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,792
She's a bright light
and she attracts a lot of bugs.

363
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:21,829
Until she figures out how
to, you know, believe in herself

364
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:25,133
and how to protect herself,
things aren't gonna change.

365
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,372
I was being told

366
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:34,876
somebody is doing Ouija board

367
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:39,714
and has somehow
summoned these things.

368
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:43,384
The demon has
a direct relationship

369
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,653
with a living male here

370
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:49,490
who accidentally
brought it back.

371
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,592
Do you know
when this happened?

372
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,630
Recently, maybe going on,
like, 50 years.

373
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,098
Do you know what it wants?

374
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,434
It can make them physically ill

375
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,237
or want to kill themselves.

376
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,354
You know, I'm gonna start
my investigation

377
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,190
with Rebecca's lead about
the deadly car accident.

378
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,059
Now, for some reason,
the local cops don't want

379
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,328
to talk to me about it.

380
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,263
So I'm heading back to meet
a local journalist

381
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,966
who says this tragedy could've
definitely been prevented.

382
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,309
Okay, so this accident,
what can you tell me about it?

383
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,379
It happened in 2005, May 25.

384
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,715
There was a carload
of four teenagers.

385
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,583
They were coming up the road
this way.

386
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,751
Okay.

387
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,020
Ben Moden, he was 17 years old.
He was driving.

388
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,522
Now was he from this area,
this kid, Moden? Or...

389
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,423
- Yes.
- He was. Okay.

390
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,292
Who else was in the car
with him?

391
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,829
18-year-old Kurtis Soeby,
17-year-old Brenden McBride,

392
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,732
and then a 15-year-old girl
named Shawntae Taylor.

393
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,735
Okay, so describe the accident
for me. What happened?

394
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:09,537
Ben and his friends were
coming up the road this way,

395
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,272
going at a good rate of speed

396
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:13,307
A pickup truck
was coming this way.

397
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,276
Ben blew right through
this stop sign.

398
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,144
He was trying to beat
the pickup truck.

399
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,179
Okay, so how bad
was this wreck?

400
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,983
It was awful, and debris
was found hundreds of feet

401
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,686
around the crash site.
- Wow.

402
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,921
How many people died
in this accident?

403
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:29,290
One at the scene,
Shawntae Taylor, the girl.

404
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,591
And then Kurtis Soeby,

405
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,893
he was airlifted
to a hospital in Denver

406
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:36,931
and died 3 days later
of his injuries.

407
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,332
All right.
So what about this kid Moden?

408
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,500
Did they charge him?

409
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:40,935
They charged him
with several misdemeanors

410
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:44,405
'cause he was a minor when
he was arrested at the hospital.

411
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,940
At the sentencing,
he actually said

412
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,309
that he wished it had
been him

413
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,811
instead of his friends
who had died.

414
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,246
Ultimately, he got his wish.

415
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:53,547
How so?

416
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,717
He was done with house arrest
in July of 2006.

417
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,185
Okay.

418
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,753
And then just 3 months later,
he was driving with a friend,

419
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:03,958
21-year-old Joseph Darr,
4:00 in the morning,

420
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,160
blasting down the highway,
loses control,

421
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:09,263
flips it several times,
both ejected from the car,

422
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,565
neither one wearing
a seat belt, again.

423
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,935
And Joseph walked away
with serious injuries,

424
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:19,773
but Ben was killed
from traumatic head injury.

425
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:23,444
In his autopsy, they found
cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy.

426
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:27,081
Well, maybe if he would've done
some time in the first accident,

427
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,716
he'd be alive today.

428
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,789
I'm seeing an angry male,

429
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,293
and there was something
wrong with him.

430
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:43,430
Basically, he's just...crazy.

431
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,799
I don't know what made him
crazy, though.

432
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,470
He hurts himself
and would hurt other people.

433
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,240
They locked him up.

434
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,275
His face is all smooshed up.

435
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,677
Do you know
why he's like that?

436
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,178
His face is like that...

437
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,481
'cause he's in pain.

438
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,751
Rebecca says she thinks
fracking in the area

439
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:05,252
may have stirred things up.

440
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:08,989
Now I don't know about that,
but she got me thinking.

441
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,891
If her water supply
got contaminated,

442
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,961
could it be making her sick
and causing her to hallucinate?

443
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,163
I'm heading over to meet
an environmental scientist

444
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,898
to see if that's
even possible.

445
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
My clients here have
been experiencing

446
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:29,476
some serious paranormal
activity for about 2 years.

447
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,879
I don't expect you
to get into the whole
paranormal side of things,

448
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,515
but they said it was the time
fracking started in the area.

449
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:35,849
What exactly is fracking?

450
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,652
It's a process by which
you drill into the Earth,

451
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,921
and you use
high-pressure water

452
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,624
and a cocktail compound
of chemicals

453
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:47,528
to bring oil out of
solid rock in the ground.

454
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,763
They're fracking pretty close
here, from what I understand.

455
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,599
They are, so about 100 yards
from here is Weld County,

456
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,770
and there are 15,000 fracking
wells in Weld County alone.

457
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,740
Now, have there been any leaks
around here that you know of?

458
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:04,178
Sure. Within the county, there
was a 28,000-gallon oil spill

459
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,181
associated with fracking
in the past year.

460
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,450
Okay. So if they're drinking
contaminated water

461
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:10,751
for an extended period
of time,

462
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,720
what's the symptoms
gonna be like?

463
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:15,422
So you're going to see
headaches, anxiety,

464
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:17,524
dizziness, delirium,

465
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,493
and for more extended
periods of time

466
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,161
and in higher doses
of chemicals,

467
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:24,398
you'd see things like cancer
and potentially even death.

468
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,401
So it'd probably be a good idea
for me to test the water?

469
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,336
I would certainly
recommend that.

470
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,038
Okay.

471
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:36,110
I'm seeing that demon again.

472
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,079
I saw this thing

473
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:42,983
in the drainage ditch outside.

474
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:47,387
It inhales water,
and it comes inside,

475
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:52,926
and it'll go on the person
and then vomit into their back,

476
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:57,131
and then the evil
is always in their backs.

477
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,467
This causes the living here

478
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:03,537
to either get sick

479
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,573
or kill themselves.

480
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:14,348
The person then can spread it
to other living people.

481
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,750
- Just by being around them?
- Yes.

482
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,520
Just how sick can it
make people?

483
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,989
I think that it can cause death.

484
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,698

490
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,029
So far, I've got a client
under attack,

491
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:56,365
on our property near the site
of a deadly car crash

492
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,534
that killed two teenagers,

493
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:00,469
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

494
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:03,672
Searching through old records,

495
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,140
I find an article about

496
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:06,708
a farmhand
who was brutally murdered

497
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,012
right next door
to my client's property.

498
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,413
You know,
I got a local crime writer

499
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:13,148
to look into this murder for me.

500
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,651
Now, she told me the case
took a big twist

501
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,754
when the local judge made
a surprising announcement.

502
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,962
Well, Chris,
thanks for meeting with me.

503
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:28,664
- I appreciate that.
- Sure.

504
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,633
Before we get to the homicide,
where exactly did it happen?

505
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,136
It happened on
an 800-acre farm

506
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,371
right next door
to your client's property.

507
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,875
The farm was owned by a man
named Louis Clinton Rockwell

508
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,978
who was an attorney
who lived in Denver.

509
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,313
Now, Chris, I know
in the article it said

510
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,214
it involved farmhands.

511
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,816
All right.
What do we know about them?

512
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:50,118
These guys were
Swedish immigrants,

513
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,788
and they lived in a barn
on the property.

514
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,525
They're young, single,
sort of drifters that come in

515
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,727
and work in the summer
and then leave.

516
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,963
Okay, Chris, so do me a favor.
Let's go through the homicide.

517
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:02,097
What happened?

518
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:05,267
Well, on the night
of November 11, 1889,

519
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,035
the farmhands were in the barn.
- Okay.

520
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:09,538
And they were down
in the lounge area, drinking.

521
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,108
And about 8:00,
one of them, Albert Martin,

522
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,510
decided he was going to go
upstairs and go to bed,

523
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:18,647
and the rest of them stayed down
and continued to get hammered.

524
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,816
Okay, which guys like that
are gonna do 'cause,

525
00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:22,618
you know, there's
nothing else to do there.
Right. Right.

526
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,822
And later on in the evening,
Elmer Robb, one of the men,

527
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:28,090
who was a really big guy,

528
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,993
decided that he wanted
the others to fist-fight

529
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,327
for his amusement.

530
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,663
He was badgering them
and threatening them,

531
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:36,865
and finally,
one person did agree,

532
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,301
and so he decided
to go upstairs

533
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:42,270
and get Martin to come down
and fight the guy.

534
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,372
All right.
So this guy is already in bed.

535
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:44,806
How did they react to that?

536
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:48,343
At that point, Martin, feeling
kind of threatened, got up,

537
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:52,714
grabbed a.32-caliber revolver,
and went downstairs with him.

538
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,750
And he feels that
he's threatened.

539
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:56,184
Robb's a big guy.

540
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:58,220
So he pulls out
his.32-caliber

541
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:00,522
and shoots him
three times in the chest.

542
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:03,592
- And he kills him?
- Yes.

543
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:04,960
That's funny, though.
You mentioned on the phone,

544
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,396
there was a surprising decision
by the judge.

545
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:08,864
Right.

546
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,766
Well, the sheriff felt that
they had the guy dead to right,

547
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:12,834
so they wanted to
charge him with murder.

548
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,870
- Okay.
- But the judge totally disagreed

549
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:19,074
and refused to arraign him
and let him go.

550
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,308
All right,
so it sounds like

551
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,810
the judge thought it was
self-defense.

552
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,445
Right.
Robb's sort of a jerk.

553
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,814
He probably deserved
what he got, really.

554
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,087
There's, like,
a couple of men out here,

555
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,022
and they're dead,

556
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:36,358
and they're not good.

557
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,593
I don't even know
what they're doing here.

558
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:40,862
They're not from here.

559
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,197
So how many are there?

560
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:46,535
I think there's three,
but there could be more.

561
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,003
Do you know
when this is from?

562
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,706
I'd say
in the last hundred years.

563
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,907
There'll all white men.

564
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:57,646
They're probably ranging
from age 18 to 40.

565
00:25:57,648 --> 00:25:59,047
There's a skinny one.

566
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,216
There's a built one.

567
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:02,818
I don't know how they died.

568
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,221
I hear one was executed.

569
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:08,356
I know they killed somebody.

570
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,895
I think that they would cause
a lot of activity

571
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:16,531
in that building.

572
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,001
I do think that the living
have seen them.

573
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:21,403
They feel aggressive.

574
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:25,841
They feel territorial,
and they don't want to leave,

575
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:28,510
and they feel safe here.

576
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:31,113
It's like, "Get out. Get out.
Get out. Get out."

577
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:33,515
They don't like anybody in here.

578
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,417
No. They don't like it.

579
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,785
Mnh-mnh.

580
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:46,094
I saw several entities
during my walk,

581
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,730
but two of them had me
the most concerned.

582
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,432
First, the demon.

583
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:54,369
Its body is like a slug
that kind of

584
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:58,473
has an upside-down
triangle head shape,

585
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:01,009
and the mouth was more
like a big hole.

586
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:07,048
Next, I described
the shadow person

587
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,317
I saw attacking
a living woman.

588
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:12,754
He was on top of her
in a bed,

589
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:17,893
and he had his arms
on either side of her

590
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:21,062
and his legs on either
side of her legs,

591
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:24,166
and he's got her,
like, pegged.

592
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,008
Is this what you saw?

593
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,810
Yes.

594
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:57,432
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

595
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,901
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

596
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:02,671
and our clients
for the first time.

597
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:06,041
Now, Amy, we've done
over 125 cases together,

598
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,176
and we've met a lot of people
going through hell,

599
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:11,680
but Rebecca's case is
one of the worst.

600
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:13,481
This is her mom, Linda.

601
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,883
She lives in this house.

602
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:17,619
This is her boyfriend, Mike,
who stays here on occasion.

603
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:20,689
They're all experiencing things,
but they're worried

604
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:23,391
that whatever is here
is trying to kill Rebecca.

605
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:25,794
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys,

606
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,796
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

607
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,469
The first thing that I need
to discuss really quickly

608
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:37,405
is that I've been very sick,

609
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,709
and when you're sick and you're
doing this kind of work,

610
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,911
you're extremely vulnerable.

611
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:47,315
I waited until I got here
to actually open,

612
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:50,351
but once I did open,
one of the first things I got

613
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,555
was a lot of negative energy
from the living here.

614
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:57,459
I was hearing a lot
of different people arguing.

615
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,562
There was definitely a male
and a female that was

616
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,832
the top and most consistent

617
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,700
with the arguing.

618
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,836
Now, Rebecca, you guys
have been fighting, right?

619
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:10,672
- Yeah.
- Tell Amy about that.

620
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,341
Just fight a lot for
sometimes...

621
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:16,377
seems no really good reason.

622
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,512
Why is that?

623
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,881
I feel like my personality
has changed.

624
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,983
I feel very anxious
all the time.

625
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:26,221
I'm...probably not a lot of fun
to be around.

626
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,189
- Interesting.
- She gets upset.

627
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:29,457
She gets depressed,
you know,

628
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:31,493
just has this
negative self-image.

629
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,027
Now, Mom, is that her?

630
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,332
Didn't used to be her, no,
but that's how she is, now.

631
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:41,736
Okay. So what else?

632
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,707
There are two separate
entities here

633
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,509
that are really your problem.

634
00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:50,044
The first one is the demon.

635
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:57,418
When I first encountered it,
it was slithering like a snake.

636
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,220
It does have arms and legs,

637
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,956
but they're extremely
underdeveloped.

638
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:05,160
Its face is extremely
triangular.

639
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,195
Rebecca, do me a favor
and tell her

640
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:09,998
what you described
to me upstairs.

641
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,103
I saw kind of a shiny black
kind of a hovering blob,

642
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,439
but it had tentacles
coming off of it.

643
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,775
Now when I spoke
to your girlfriend Heidi,

644
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,544
she talked about
a black-and-white figure

645
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:25,180
with strange long ears

646
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:27,081
that would follow her around
when she was kid.

647
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,284
Interesting. Okay.

648
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,152
Do you think what
Heidi and Rebecca saw as kids

649
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:32,821
was this demon thing?

650
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:35,156
I actually did have
a sketch done of it.

651
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,629
This is interesting.

652
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,965
This reminds me of what
your girlfriend was telling me.

653
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:48,570
Ooh.

654
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:52,307
It looks like what Heidi would
describe, with the long ears.

655
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:56,177
This thing is in your house
now, apparently.

656
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,881
I almost don't have words
for something like that.

657
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:03,218
It's just...

658
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,887
it's almost impossible
to comprehend.

659
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,760
So I saw this thing in
a drainage ditch outside.

660
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:17,799
It was sucking up mud and all
this crap from the ditch

661
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,468
through its nose
and go inside,

662
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,371
and it would vomit out
this black stuff

663
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:28,076
that it had inhaled
into the person's back.

664
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:30,812
What I got for living people
is that it can make them

665
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,614
very, very ill,

666
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:36,050
or it can make them
have suicidal thoughts,

667
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:38,186
and the thing that
I thought maybe

668
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,290
that it had possibly
killed somebody already.

669
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,828
You mentioned something
about potential suicide?

670
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,129
I came across something
in my research

671
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,364
that might be important.

672
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,833
In 2005, there was
a deadly car accident

673
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:54,202
right up on the corner here,
just a few hundred feet away.

674
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,604
Four teenagers were
driving in a sedan.

675
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,840
They felt as if the driver
was being suicidal

676
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:00,275
from the way he drove.

677
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:03,544
The driver, Ben Moden, was
reckless and blew right through

678
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,680
that stop sign
at the end of the road here.

679
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:08,683
They were T-boned
by an oncoming pickup truck.

680
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:12,153
Now, this was a huge crash,
and debris went everywhere.

681
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,855
None of the kids
were wearing seatbelts.

682
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:16,457
One of the boys
was ejected from the car.

683
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,626
He died 3 days later
at a hospital.

684
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:21,029
A 15-year-old girl
named Shawntae Taylor

685
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:23,564
was killed at the scene,

686
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,733
and the driver, Ben Moden,

687
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,236
he wound up getting sentenced
to one year's house arrest

688
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,138
because he was a minor
at the time.

689
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,073
He had no drugs or alcohol
in his system,

690
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,043
so no one knows
why he ran the stop sign.

691
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,412
Unfortunately, we can't ask him.

692
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,047
That's because he's dead.

693
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,549
A year later, Ben Moden was
in another accident.

694
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:44,018
He and a friend were driving
fast down the highway

695
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,386
at 4:00 in the morning.

696
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:47,588
Again, this kid Ben Moden
was driving.

697
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,090
They weren't wearing seat belts.

698
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,461
Ben lost control of the car
and flipped several times.

699
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:55,630
Both guys were ejected
from the car.

700
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:57,532
Ben was killed.

701
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:59,067
I could be wrong,
but it seemed like

702
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,735
he had a death wish, this kid.

703
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:04,472
Just a sad situation.

704
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:05,940
So I don't know if this
is connected or not,

705
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,710
but you mentioned this demon
thing likes to drink water

706
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:09,978
from the drainage ditch.

707
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,214
- Is that right?
- Yes.

708
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,750
Rebecca, you told me you
thought activity picked up

709
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:18,853
after they started fracking here
a couple of years ago.

710
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:20,955
Sometimes, fracking
can contaminate

711
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,156
peoples' the drinking water.

712
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:23,992
Now, I talked to
an environmental expert

713
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:26,194
who says that exposure
to these chemicals

714
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,396
could cause some of
the experiences you're having.

715
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,199
But when I had your water
tested, it came back normal.

716
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,400
Okay.

717
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,901
Now you said this thing
makes people sick.

718
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:37,805
Linda's husband, and Rebecca's
father, died about 6 months ago.

719
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,774
- Yes.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

720
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:42,410
I have a couple of photos
of him here, one with Rebecca.

721
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:46,347
You said it could cause
suicidal thoughts,

722
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:50,418
and my dad was hospitalized at
one time for attempted suicide.

723
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,786
Really?

724
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:53,955
He struggled with depression.

725
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:59,994
He would just say to me,
"I had some visitors today,

726
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,031
"and they came to see me,

727
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:05,633
but I know they weren't
really here."

728
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:10,271
Could this thing have caused him
to want to commit suicide?

729
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:11,572
Yes.

730
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:18,479
So this demon, it was
accidentally picked up

731
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:20,648
by a male who lived here.

732
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:25,553
And I got that this was recent,
like in the last 50 years.

733
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:27,288
Well, there's some other stuff
you should know.

734
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,423
Mike and Rebecca have done

735
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,191
a ton of paranormal things
in the past.

736
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,959
You name it, they've tried it.

737
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:34,295
I want you to explain to her
what's going on,

738
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,396
what you guys did,

739
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,532
and how the stuff spiked
after you two met.

740
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,068
Well, it was ill-advised,
but we, you know,

741
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,905
decided to have a couple
sessions with a Ouija board.

742
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,306
List the other things
you've done.

743
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,208
We've reached out
to an exorcist,

744
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,643
a demonologist.

745
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:52,480
We've worked with a, like,
a Reiki Master,

746
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:54,649
and we did a ghost tour
on my birthday.

747
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,917
Now, Linda,
I know you don't like

748
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,486
all the...they're doing, right?
- No. I don't.

749
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:02,390
I don't feel that doors
should be opened

750
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,292
when you have a choice not to.

751
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:06,494
So did Mike and Rebecca
bring this demon here?

752
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:07,829
No.

753
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:12,733
This could be possibly
your husband

754
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:16,737
because it wasn't something
he was looking for.

755
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,107
- It was accidentally picked up.
- Okay.

756
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:21,409
So it sounds like it wasn't
Mike and Rebecca

757
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,277
fooling around with the stuff.

758
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,679
Not for that.

759
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,148
Okay. For what?

760
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,417
For something else.

761
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,718
So you're not off the hook.

762
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,453
No, you're not.

763
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:34,789
The biggest threat
in the house

764
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,893
to<i> you,</i> specifically,
is the shadow man.

765
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:43,931
So what I saw was a male
with a Ouija board,

766
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,535
and that is what caused
the shadow person

767
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:49,804
to come into this realm.

768
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:53,407
And I saw it fixated on a female
in the room upstairs,

769
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:54,609
to the left.

770
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,811
That's Rebecca's room.

771
00:35:56,813 --> 00:36:00,448
Some of the specific things
that I saw it doing to you

772
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,151
was dragging you off the bed,

773
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:06,621
that there would be bruises that
you would maybe wake up with

774
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,957
because it's trying to pick you
up and drag you through walls,

775
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,793
and that it's happening
pretty much every night.

776
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,028
You remember when I said

777
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,264
Rebecca was going through hell
here, right?

778
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,932
You pretty much hit on why.

779
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,902
I get scratches and bruises.

780
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:23,271
Look at this.
Look at these bruises.

781
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:25,706
Wow.

782
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,942
Feel like I've been
held down in my bed.

783
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:30,711
I had my tooth knocked out.

784
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,847
I was laying in bed
and I went to sit up,

785
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,751
and as I was sitting up, I felt,
like, a punch in my face.

786
00:36:36,753 --> 00:36:38,986
All right. Now this
is the weird part, though.

787
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,321
This stuff doesn't
just happen here.

788
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,424
When you go to Mike's house,
it's happened.

789
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,960
And she just got, basically,
thrown off her feet

790
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:48,262
and into my closet door.

791
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:50,431
There might be some
jealousy stuff here

792
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:53,201
because you're dealing
with a shadow person

793
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:56,504
who believes that
she's a shadow person.

794
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:01,008
That's why it's so mean
and so aggressive with you.

795
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,579
It wants you
to go home with it.

796
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:06,280
I know you weren't intending
to do something like that.

797
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,049
I mean, are you feeling
guilty about it?

798
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,885
Yeah. I kind of am, and it
really wasn't even my idea

799
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,487
to do the Ouija board.

800
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,122
So you're blaming Rebecca
for this?

801
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:18,492
She started seeing
this black shadow

802
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,027
before the Ouija board.

803
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,597
- You buying that?
- All I know is what I see,

804
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,633
and what I saw was a man
with a Ouija board,

805
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,635
and then this thing
was there.

806
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:29,170
You're busted, cuz.
Forget about it.

807
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,708
Another thing I saw
this shadow person

808
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,577
doing to you
was really horrifying,

809
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,380
and I actually did have
a sketch done of it.

810
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:49,924
Gee whiz.

811
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,626
That's why I don't sleep
at night.

812
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:58,566
I didn't want to bring it up,
but there was some other issues

813
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,569
you had in the bedroom
with this thing.

814
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,039
I felt like one
night, I was sexually assaulted,

815
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,808
but there was nothing there.

816
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,245
I just can't imagine
what she's going through.

817
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,247
We just have to fix it.

818
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,349
What the hell does this thing
want with Rebecca?

819
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:17,952
Well, it wants
to take her home.

820
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:21,088
So if, god forbid, this was to
happen, where would she wind up?

821
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,758
She would be missing.

822
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,528
He could accidentally
kill you

823
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,465
trying to get you
to his reality.

824
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,262
Now, Rebecca, when we spoke
the other day,

825
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:54,197
I knew this was going to be
a rough night for you,

826
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,166
but I had no idea it was
going to be this bad.

827
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,934
Now, I don't know what Amy
is going to say,

828
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,302
but I hope she has
a solution for you,

829
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,604
because nobody deserves
to go through the abuse

830
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,206
you're going through.

831
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,275
With that, I'll turn it over
to Amy and see what she's got.

832
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,314
It's a very unique situation

833
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,317
because real shadow people
are negative

834
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,755
and nearly impossible
to get rid of.

835
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:23,460
So you are, unfortunately,
in an abusive relationship

836
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,562
that you can't get out of.

837
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:29,599
So you are going to have
to implement

838
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:33,870
different protection measures
to try to survive.

839
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,173
Something will work for a month,
and then it'll stop,

840
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:41,411
and then you're going to have to
employ a different measure.

841
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,979
What are we looking for?

842
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,647
Because I want
to help with this.

843
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:48,184
I can give you a bag of stuff
that you can use.

844
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,787
You know, putting black salt
around your bed at night.

845
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,188
Maybe it'll work
for a few nights,

846
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,125
and then you go to, say,

847
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:58,595
putting brimstone or sulfur
at your door,

848
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:03,633
but it's always going to be
something that's temporary.

849
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:06,102
What you can hope is that
one day,

850
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,405
he's gonna figure it out
and he's going to figure out

851
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,509
how to get himself back
to his realm.

852
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:13,877
I can't get rid of him.

853
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,613
I don't want to live the rest
of my life with him.

854
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,982
I tell you,
this is a heartbreaking case.

855
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,750
I really don't have words
for it.

856
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,353
I was just so hoping
that we could deal

857
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,255
with the shadow person.

858
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,458
Unfortunately, it's like you're
going to be experimenting.

859
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,828
That's all you can do
with shadow people.

860
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,997
What about this guy?

861
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,432
Now that guy, you can do
something about.

862
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,203
Find a local tribe and a local
person from that tribe

863
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:43,773
who is either a practicing
medicine person or a shaman.

864
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,542
That person can come here

865
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:49,379
and can protect
your entire property line.

866
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:50,780
Are you going to do that?

867
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,315
Yeah.

868
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:55,118
That's probably fairly easy
for us to...

869
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,488
...get a hold of them.

870
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,924
I think it would be
a huge first step

871
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:05,195
because I think it might
allow her to be healthier.

872
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:07,764
And building
her confidence level.

873
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,033
I mean, how do you feel about
knowing everything now?

874
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:12,101
It's pretty hard
to put into words.

875
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:17,073
I was so hopeful that
we really...

876
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,641
would get something
more positive

877
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,312
to resolve it,
but we'll resolve it.

878
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,147
It'll just take work.

879
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,683
You know what you're dealing
with now, I think.

880
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,721
I know what to do now.

881
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,990
I really hope Rebecca
contacts a shaman

882
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,594
to banish the demon that's
been terrorizing her family.

883
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,396
Once he's gone, she can focus
on protecting herself

884
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,032
from the shadow person
tormenting her.

885
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,268
And hopefully, one day,
it will leave on its own,

886
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,136
giving Rebecca some peace.
