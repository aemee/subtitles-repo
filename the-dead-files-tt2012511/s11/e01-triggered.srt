1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,778
I'm getting violence here.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,181
I'm seeing a body on the floor.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,083
I've been pushed down
these stairs.

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,252
Somebody fell down the stairs.

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,989
He will get really
aggressive and yell.

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,793
This is a child murderer.

7
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,361
That pisses me off.

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,931
This is super bad.

9
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,434
This is not a good situation.

10
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,269
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,904
There's death here.

12
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,639
Don't wanna go down there.

13
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,874
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,976
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

15
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,645
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,448
She's definitely
a serial killer.

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,283
...and they speak to me.

18
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,419
She's going to torture them.

19
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,222
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,358
They were all murdered.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,892
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,428
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,262
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,965
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

25
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,535
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,339
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

27
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,041
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,676
Who do you think
possessed you?

29
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,845
But Steve and I
never speak...

30
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,880
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,148
...until the very end.

32
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,750
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

33
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,852
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

34
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,353
<i>Hell,</i> no.

35
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,988
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,023
Everyone is in jeopardy.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm back here
in Flint, Michigan,

38
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,408
about an hour west of Detroit.

39
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,678
This time, I got a call
from a mom named Carrie.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Now she says
whatever's in the house

41
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,382
is real angry and real violent.

42
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,017
She's got four little girls
to protect

43
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,520
and has no clue on how to do it.

44
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,522
She's hoping Amy and I can
come up with something

45
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,491
before someone
gets seriously hurt.

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,663
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

47
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,599
of any leading information --

48
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,269
photographs,
religious icons.

49
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,807
Even children's toys
can influence her findings,

50
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,144
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

51
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,945
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

52
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,114
for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:43,362
The first thing that I got
was...

54
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:47,566
in huge, like, bold letters...

55
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,469
was the word "sad."

56
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,176
First thing I'm getting
is a woman upstairs,

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,845
and she wants me to
come up there

58
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,881
because she's saying that
the children are in danger.

59
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,319
She's freaking out.
She's freaking out.

60
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,062
So, Carrie, when we spoke
on the phone,

61
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,697
you sounded pretty upset.

62
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,931
What's happening?

63
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,134
This place is tearing
my family apart,

64
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,070
mentally, physically,

65
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,572
and emotionally.

66
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,508
And then my children...

67
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,444
my children are scared
to even be here.

68
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,479
How long have you actually
lived in the house?

69
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,949
I have lived here
a little over 21/2 years.

70
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,250
Okay.

71
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,420
And when my husband's
grandparents passed away,

72
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,622
we got the home.

73
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,491
Did his grandparents
pass away in the house?

74
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,525
No, they did not.

75
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,696
They passed away
in a nursing home.

76
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,598
Who exactly
lives in the house?

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,901
You got myself,
my husband, Chad.

78
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,539
You got my daughter Ariana,
who is 11.

79
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,574
You got my daughter Victoria,
who is 10,

80
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,777
my daughter Layla,
who is 5.

81
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,112
and then Gabrielle,
who is 3.

82
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,214
So, Carrie, do me a favor.

83
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,717
Give me a list of things
that are happening.

84
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,153
We're hearing voices,
footsteps.

85
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,854
Our health is declining.

86
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,924
We're getting
physical attacks.

87
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,926
I'm seeing shadow figures.

88
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,730
Is everybody being affected,
or is it just specific people?

89
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,165
It's affecting my husband.

90
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,867
We were happily married.

91
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,771
Recently, he started becoming
really depressed.

92
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,207
What makes you so convinced
that his changes

93
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,142
have anything to do
with the paranormal?

94
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,280
Because before we moved
into here, we never fought.

95
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,550
And then his depression
started kicking in.

96
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,984
Once second, he's happy,

97
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,755
and the next minute, he's
snapping and yelling at people,

98
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:53,225
trying to accuse me of doing
something wrong that I'm not.

99
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,626
Okay.

100
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,028
I think there's something here
that is attached to him.

101
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,896
It won't let him go.

102
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,765
Whatever is going on can't
be good for the marriage.

103
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,801
No.
This could be the end of it

104
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,870
if we don't figure out
what is going on.

105
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,772
You know, it's heartbreaking
to listen to you talk.

106
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,508
And, you know, one of
the reasons I took the case

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,242
is 'cause of the kids.

108
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,744
But it sounds like
you're the one

109
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,579
that really needs
the help here.

110
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,781
Yeah.

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,618
I ain't got no one
to turn to.

112
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,720
And I need help.

113
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,623
I want this fixed.

114
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,658
I want to be better.

115
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,799
There's a male,
and he's over to my right.

116
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,133
He's dead.

117
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,503
He's like,
"Lies! They're saying lies!"

118
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:43,275
His energy is<i> crazy</i> strong.

119
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,109
I'm getting violence here.

120
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,411
"Aah!"

121
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:52,150
Like, I'm hearing a living man
yelling,

122
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,153
screaming, crying,
wanting to kill.

123
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,892
Something is influencing males

124
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,594
to be violent.

125
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,101
So you brought me up here.

126
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,969
I'm assuming you've
had experiences.

127
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,574
Yeah. I have been seeing
a small shadow.

128
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,175
Well, how tall
are we talking about?

129
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,644
Probably about
my daughter Layla's size.

130
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,579
Could that shadow
have been Layla?

131
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,382
No, because when
I come up here and check,

132
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,717
either Layla is sleeping

133
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,586
or she's gone at her grandma's
for the weekend.

134
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,790
Okay. Have you seen any other
shadows besides that one?

135
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,059
Yeah. I've seen one that is
a lot taller than that one.

136
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,461
How often you seeing these?

137
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,696
- Daily.
- Daily?

138
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,997
- Yeah.
- Anything else?

139
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,935
I've been pushed down
these stairs.

140
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,104
I actually broke my foot.

141
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,005
You're lucky you
didn't get killed.
Yeah.

142
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,708
How hard did you get pushed?
Show me. Give me a shove.

143
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,077
- Like that.
- All right.

144
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,080
So you know how lucky
you are, right?
Yes.

145
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,748
I mean, you could have got
knocked unconscious,

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,151
broke your neck, anything.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,088
The dead guy,
he knows that he can

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,424
take his energy and throw it.

149
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,696
Living people, I'd think,
be prone to falls here.

150
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,367
When he puts out
his energy like this,

151
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,969
it definitely affects
your equilibrium.

152
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,905
People would feel like
their feet

153
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,540
are coming out from under them.

154
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,710
Somebody fell down the stairs.

155
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,815
If he is able to...

156
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,051
throw somebody down the stairs,

157
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,021
that's not good.

158
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,261
Okay, what's going on
up here?

159
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,199
Well, I have been touched
inappropriately in the bathroom.

160
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,399
Mind me asking what happened?

161
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,034
I thought it was Chad.

162
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,803
It felt like somebody
just grabbed my rear.

163
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,006
I jumped out the shower
pretty quick.

164
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,208
And I went and yelled
at Chad, you know,

165
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,877
"Why the hell
did you do that?"

166
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,813
And I look in here, and he's in
the bedroom, sitting on the bed.

167
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,781
Now did that ever
happen again?

168
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,283
Yeah.

169
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,351
It happened one more time when
I was laying in bed at night.

170
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,286
Same touch?

171
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,188
Like, the inside of my legs.

172
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,758
- Okay. And...
- Chad was sleeping.

173
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,959
Okay. Not that
I'm not believing you,

174
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,627
but, I mean,
you have a dog right here.

175
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,030
You sure she or he
didn't just...

176
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,365
No, 'cause at the time,

177
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,767
she was sleeping
down in the living room.

178
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,168
All right.
What else is going on?

179
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,038
My declining health.

180
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,709
I have had
four partial hysterectomies.

181
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,979
I have had
my appendix taken out.

182
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,713
I've had my gall bladder
taken out.

183
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,582
Whenever I'm getting anxiety,

184
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,785
it makes me feel like
I'm having a heart attack.

185
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,653
Well, living here and telling me
what you're going through --

186
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,855
getting pushed down
a flight of stairs,

187
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,190
somebody grabbing your...
in the shower,

188
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,326
I mean, I'd be
a little anxious, too.

189
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,861
This house is killing me.

190
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,563
What are you hoping
we can do for you?

191
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,933
I am hoping that my relationship
with my husband

192
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,203
goes back to normal
like it was.

193
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm worried that we're gonna
end up going our separate ways.

194
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,545
I want to be the way we were
2 years ago,

195
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,946
happily married.

196
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,750
I think if living people
are having the experience,

197
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,954
I could kind of see them

198
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,624
possibly thinking
they were being grabbed.

199
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:24,229
And I got a bad pain in my head,
really, really bad.

200
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,497
Ooh, ooh.

201
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,300
Wow. What did he do?

202
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,701
Ooh.

203
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,037
I'm nauseous and dizzy.

204
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,839
The left side of my head
is wicked bad.

205
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,510
Mnh.

206
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,179
I think this is associated
with the dead male.

207
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,516
He's yelling, "You stupid!
Ha, ha, ha!"

208
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,905
Ariana and Victoria,
correct?

209
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,074
Yeah.

210
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,207
Okay.
Ariana, how old are you?

211
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,743
-11.
- You're 11. Victoria?

212
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,911
- I'm 10.

213
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,879
Now let me ask you guys
a question.

214
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,514
Do you want to stay
in the house?

215
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,917
I don't really feel like
staying here most of the time.

216
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,954
Like, my eyes water up
and I start crying.

217
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,189
Can you tell me about some of
the things that frighten you?

218
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,891
I was getting ready
to fall asleep,

219
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,061
and something grabbed
my foot.

220
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,796
Okay.
When your foot got grabbed,

221
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,531
show me how hard,
on my wrist, how you...

222
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,301
It grabbed me
just like that. Like, hard.

223
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,469
Really?

224
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,170
What about you, Victoria?
What's going on?

225
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,073
I have bad nightmares.

226
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,109
Okay.
Do you remember them?

227
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:48,012
All I remember about them,
my mom had to,

228
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,481
and my stepdad,
had to wake me up.

229
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,951
Ariana, anything else that
you've seen that scared you?

230
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,954
I have seen a really tall
shadow man

231
00:10:55,956 --> 00:11:00,091
with, like, a top hat
and facial hair.

232
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,360
Okay. Now where did you
see that?

233
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,929
It is mainly
in the hallways.

234
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,167
Are you sure it wasn't
your stepdad?

235
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,802
Yes.

236
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,305
So, guys, I was talking
to Mom and Dad.

237
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,108
I'm curious. Have you seen
a change in either one of them?

238
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,310
Chad. He's been
getting really mean.

239
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:23,381
When your stepdad Chad
gets angry, what happens?

240
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,919
He will get really aggressive
and yell above his normal voice.

241
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,287
That's not good.

242
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,128
I- I...

243
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,864
feel like there's...

244
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,200
two living females

245
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,403
that are...hiding,

246
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:49,474
and I'm just hearing, like,
yelling from...

247
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,676
I guess this room.

248
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:57,782
There is a living male, like,
acting out, like, just snapping.

249
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:03,288
Like a complete change.

250
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,296
So, Chad, I was talking
to your wife.

251
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,832
In her opinion,
since you guys moved in here,

252
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,900
your personality changed.

253
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,235
- Yeah. I agree with her.
- All right.

254
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,638
So when you're feeling
this change in personality

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,974
coming over you, what happens?
How you feeling?

256
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,243
Angry, very angry.

257
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,978
It comes to the point
where I feel like

258
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,746
I want to rip walls apart,

259
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,516
tear 'em down,
anyone in my way.

260
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,317
Your wife told me
about her experiences.

261
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,253
How about you?
Any experiences?

262
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,088
I got out of the shower
one time.

263
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,392
Me and my wife, when we seen
on the mirror, from the fog,

264
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,127
it said "kill" and "die"
on it.

265
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,931
So I ran down the hallway
and woke the girls up

266
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,166
out of a dead sleep.

267
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,868
I was furious.
I told them,

268
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,402
"Are you guys playing games?"
- Right.

269
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,671
They almost started crying,
"It wasn't us.

270
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,206
It wasn't us.
It wasn't us."

271
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,975
You're pretty convinced
the kids didn't do it.

272
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,944
I'm 100%.

273
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,479
Okay. Has anything else
happened?

274
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,215
When I'm sleeping, I feel
like something's choking me

275
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,550
and sitting on my chest.

276
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,717
Wait. Describe
the feeling to me.

277
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,686
It feels like you
can't breathe or...

278
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,289
Sit up and...
You know.

279
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,925
I thought it was trying
to kill me, suffocate me.

280
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,359
Couldn't get no air.

281
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,728
Now do you suffer from any
asthma or anything like that?

282
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,930
No.

283
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,165
Now how were you reacting
when this happened?

284
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,499
Furious.

285
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,000
- Okay.
- Furious.

286
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,803
Furious towards everybody
and everything.

287
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,446
The dead guy,
he can be very physical.

288
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,582
Living people here

289
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,652
will feel their beds jolt,

290
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,923
and it feels like an earthquake.

291
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,395
I think that that guy,

292
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:54,532
you know, who can direct
his energy,

293
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,534
is doing that.

294
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,736
Like, you're in the shower,
and the shower curtain,

295
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,338
you know, might pull back.

296
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,907
This is super bad.

297
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,748
He's showing people
people sitting, sitting here,

298
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,553
and he's showing me him
smacking them upside the head.

299
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,422
You know? Like, just whap.

300
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,824
All of a sudden,
they start feeling

301
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,127
like they're getting smacked on
the, you know, like...

302
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,864
So from what Carrie told me,

303
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,833
you inherited this house
from your grandparents.

304
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,968
Correct.

305
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,769
How far apart
did they pass away?

306
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,704
A year.

307
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,106
I see you're looking over here.
Is this them?

308
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,574
That is them. Yes, it is.

309
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,010
What did they die from?

310
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,579
Actually, my grandmother
had a brain tumor.

311
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,447
And your grandfather?

312
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,950
He died from gangrene,
pretty much.

313
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,519
And he just kind of rotted
from his feet up.

314
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,853
What kind of guy was he?

315
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,556
He's a good guy,
but he didn't like women.

316
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,858
He had
a very super bad temper.

317
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,127
Any abuse?

318
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,529
Yeah, I've never seen him
ever do physical abuse

319
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,398
but a lot of mental.

320
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,201
Do you think
your grandparents are here?

321
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,536
Yeah. I do.

322
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,205
You think he's taking out
his aggressions

323
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,739
on your wife and kids?

324
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,608
Wife and my kids, yes.

325
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,943
'Cause they're all women.

326
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,886
The dead guy,
he showed me him, like,

327
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,989
grabbing somebody by the neck,

328
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,692
a female, and holding her
up against the wall

329
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,628
to the point where her feet
were, like,

330
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,397
this much off the floor.

331
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,968
Any idea who this dead guy
was in life?

332
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,237
He was white.

333
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,806
Like, max, I would say, 5'10".

334
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,775
I see him with an older woman.

335
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,743
There was abuse.

336
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,679
So he lived here at some point,
and then he died.

337
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,782
He didn't die here,
you know what I'm saying?

338
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,717
But he's back here.

339
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,254
And he's a big problem here.

340
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,137
This is our third investigation
in Flint,

341
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,573
so I've gotten to know a lot
of the local experts here.

342
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,875
One historian
just called me back,

343
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,211
and he said he found
a bizarre string of murders

344
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,081
with a direct connection
to Chad and Carrie's property.

345
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,654
Well, Walt, thanks
for meeting me.

346
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,123
I really appreciate that.

347
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,459
Now you mentioned on the phone
there was a sting of homicides

348
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,126
connected
to my clients' property.

349
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,530
Before we get to that, who owned
the land when this happened?

350
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,533
Well, Steve,
the original landowner

351
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,769
was Thomas Brandt.

352
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,073
He owned over 70,000 acres
of land here in Genesee County.

353
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,408
Okay, 70,000 acres.

354
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,511
Was my client's house
and property even close

355
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,812
to where this guy was?

356
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:59,250
Yes. As a matter of fact,
Thomas Brandt's estate was here.

357
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,186
Your client's property was
in this area here.

358
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,654
Okay.
So this was pretty close.

359
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,722
Yes.

360
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,090
So what is the story
with the murders?

361
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:10,261
Thomas' daughter, Charlotte,
in 1858, falls in love

362
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,465
with a tenant farmer next door,
Davillo Palmer.

363
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,067
Well, there are two problems
with this relationship.

364
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,271
One, Charlotte's mother
does not approve,

365
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,741
and two,
Palmer is already married.

366
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,076
What happens with Charlotte?

367
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,213
Charlotte turns up pregnant,
and not long after that,

368
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,083
Davillo Palmer's wife suddenly
and mysteriously, disappears.

369
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,551
Pretty convenient.

370
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,955
Some accounts say that there was
a child who also went missing

371
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,890
at the same time
as the mother.

372
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,660
Were they able
to pin this on Davillo?

373
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,228
Surprisingly, no.

374
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,696
Murder was suspected,

375
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,033
but they could never pin
any charges on Davillo.

376
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,573
There's a little girl
running around here.

377
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,975
She's probably
5 or 6 years old.

378
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,480
She got, like, a little dress on
and then an apron thing on.

379
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,249
So I would say, like,
that was...

380
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,586
like, 1870s or 1880s.

381
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,590
Something happened to her
that wasn't good,

382
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,260
and I feel like
whatever happened to her

383
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,395
happened here.

384
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,797
Like, I'm seeing...

385
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,066
So she's outside
and it's sunny.

386
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,701
It's getting dark.

387
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,337
She knows the person...

388
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,573
and then she's dead.

389
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,709
All right, so Davillo's wife
and possible child

390
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,046
are out of the picture.
What happens next?

391
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,916
Charlotte and Davillo
wind up getting married,

392
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,551
and 6 months later,

393
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,221
Charlotte's mother dies
under mysterious circumstances.

394
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,057
What is the cause of death?

395
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,627
The autopsy shows that she died
of arsenic poisoning.

396
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,063
I mean, they already
like Davillo with one homicide.

397
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,564
Did they look at him
for this one?

398
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:57,235
He was a person of interest
in his mother-in-law's death,

399
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,837
but he disappeared before
he could be indicted.

400
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,840
So, Walt, we got at least
two murders, maybe three,

401
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,442
pretty close to
my client's property,

402
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,044
and nobody served a day of time
for any of it.

403
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,179
That's correct.

404
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,186
The little girl,
she sees a monster.

405
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,991
It looked like
when tar is bubbling,

406
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,427
but make it big,
like a human being.

407
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,396
And is that something
that the living

408
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,465
are affected by anyway,
or is it just her?

409
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,067
That thing is the culprit
of everything.

410
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,139
It seems like this monster

411
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,341
went dormant until now.

412
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,078
It has to have the people
that are predispositioned

413
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,180
to the violence and the anger.

414
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,182
So those living people
who move here

415
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,986
who have that predisposition
triggers everything.

416
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,357
So I just got a call back
from a sergeant

417
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,859
with the local
police department.

418
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,095
He says he found something
I definitely need to know about.

419
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,564
Apparently, a pregnant woman
was found murdered

420
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,501
less than a mile
from Carrie and Chad's house,

421
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,571
and this remains
an unsolved case to this day.

422
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,572
Now he's going through
all the records for me,

423
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,575
and he's going to tell me
exactly what happened.

424
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,116
Well, Sergeant, I appreciate
you looking into this for me.

425
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,052
The body that was found close
to my client's property,

426
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,153
what can you tell me
about it?

427
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,120
Her name was Hope Johnson.

428
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,323
She went missing
on January 29, 1988.

429
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,858
Okay. So this is
a pretty cold homicide.

430
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,459
Correct.

431
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,128
She's a pretty girl.

432
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,596
All right. So what do we know
about this girl?

433
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,998
At the time
of her disappearance,

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,199
Hope Johnson
was 8 months pregnant

435
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,567
and had a 4-year-old son.

436
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,537
She was last seen by her
boyfriend January 29, 1988,

437
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,072
and he reported her missing
to the police department

438
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,908
on February 2, 1988.

439
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,476
How long
before they find her?

440
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,345
Roughly 6 weeks after
she was reported missing,

441
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,746
she was found on March 12th.

442
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,547
Her body was found
on the side of the road,

443
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,949
roughly 1 mile
from the client's house.

444
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,518
Was the boyfriend a suspect
at all?

445
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,154
We were not able to develop him
as a suspect in this case.

446
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,623
They questioned a lot
of people.
Yes.

447
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,425
Okay, and nobody
ever got arrested?

448
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,294
No.
No one was ever arrested.

449
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,495
Now I know it's an open case,
and you can't tell me anything

450
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,032
about the details
of her murder.
Right.

451
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,234
But when I worked these cases
in the past,

452
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,237
it's always been
somebody they knew

453
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,439
and a lot of rage involved.

454
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,641
I just hope you guys
get a break on it

455
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,242
because this is
a pretty sad case.

456
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,445
Yes, very sad.

457
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,314
Is this living man
being influenced

458
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,250
by this tar thing at all?

459
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,985
Yes.

460
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,655
This is a child murderer.

461
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,259
I think that this person

462
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,628
is completely insane

463
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,600
and probably
just thrives off of...

464
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:46,070
violence and, you know,
gets its kicks off of that

465
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,406
and is still capable
of doing it.

466
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,709
I think that it could
be satisfied

467
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,211
with an adult
killing another adult.

468
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,014
I think that it probably
prefers children.

469
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,622
For more information

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,110
So far, I've got clients

476
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,179
being physically attacked
on a property

477
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,514
where a man was suspected
of murdering his wife,

478
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,917
mother-in-law, and possibly
even his own child.

479
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,053
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

480
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,589
Searching through old records,
I find an article about

481
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,124
an auto plant
right down the street

482
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,126
from Chad and Carrie's property.

483
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,661
Turns out an employee
suffered a gruesome death

484
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,830
while working there.

485
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,032
I'm on my way to
the old Packard plant in Detroit

486
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,167
to meet an autoworker
turned historian.

487
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,403
Now he says he found a couple
of other deaths

488
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,439
in the plants surrounding
Chad and Carrie's property.

489
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,680
So, Gerry, that article
I found in my research,

490
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,283
it sounds like this guy
died a pretty brutal death.

491
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,585
What were we able to find out?

492
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,287
That on October 3, 1963,

493
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,356
a worker by the name
of Michael McDonough,

494
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,724
who was 26 years old,

495
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,927
died when a boom
struck him in the head.

496
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,029
So, Gerry, let me ask you,
how far is this plant

497
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,231
from my client's property?

498
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,632
Less than a mile.

499
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,366
Now does he die
right there on the spot?

500
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,603
Normally,
in a General Motors factory,

501
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,637
because of their insurance,

502
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,307
that if you die
on the property,

503
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,642
it's double a payout.

504
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,578
So normally, most of them
that you will find,

505
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,782
they're usually pronounced dead
in the hospital by a physician.

506
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,449
Okay.

507
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,918
There's no way this guy wasn't
dead when this thing hit him.

508
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,452
Probably not.

509
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,254
Now you mentioned on the phone
there was a couple other ones.

510
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,522
What'd you find out?

511
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:49,693
Found one in factory 31,
the axle plant, June 19th,

512
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,929
and that was 1979.

513
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,398
And this is a different plant
close to my client's property?

514
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,269
Yes. John Holstein, who was
a 21-year-old worker.

515
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,606
So a hydraulic line broke
and sprayed him down

516
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,608
head to toe
with hydraulic fluid

517
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,743
that was flammable
at that time,

518
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,746
and a spark
from unknown origin

519
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,848
is what turned him
into the human torch.

520
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,418
And a witness to that,
it just so happens,

521
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,619
was a friend of mine.

522
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,622
And he seen him running
for quite some ways

523
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,524
before he finally dropped.

524
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,759
Did he die right away?

525
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,561
He passed away 2 weeks later
in the hospital.

526
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,631
Ouch. Now, Gerry, what else
were you able to find out?

527
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,901
Another one at the Buick plant
in the body shop.

528
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:34,572
It was on December 23, 1994.

529
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,573
- It was Willy Anderson.
- Okay.

530
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,042
And he was a die setter.

531
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,978
He forgot to unhook a block --
80,000 pounds --

532
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,380
and this die just
instantly crushed him

533
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:47,251
between a guard rail
and the die.

534
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,653
Before you became a historian,
you worked in this plant.

535
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,988
Yeah.

536
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,723
Were these accidents you just
described to me commonplace,

537
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,526
or is it something that was,
you know, once in a blue moon?

538
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:58,795
They were pretty commonplace,
and, at that time,

539
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,998
speed was the name
of the game.

540
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,267
We were trying to save
the Buick plant.

541
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,068
And look where that got you.

542
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,404
Yeah.
This is where we're at.

543
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,878
I'm seeing a body on the floor.

544
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,147
I think it's a man.

545
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,650
I'm getting, like,
some chaos here.

546
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,420
Like, I hear a woman crying.

547
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:27,391
I'm hearing somebody
yelling for help.

548
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:31,095
And I'm feeling, like,
a lot of people running around.

549
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,864
Chaos.

550
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,574
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

551
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:47,912
but the violent dead man
had me very concerned.

552
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:51,582
He did have a mustache.

553
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,984
He had a thick, short neck.

554
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,528
Next, I described the dead man
attacking a living person.

555
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,397
He was showing me him, like,

556
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,735
actually holding this person
above the stairs,

557
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,271
and he was saying how

558
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:17,274
he threw someone down there.

559
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,143
I do believe it was a female,

560
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:22,646
and that this person was
smaller than him.

561
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,721
Amy, is this what you saw?

562
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,424
Yes. that's what I saw.

563
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,179
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

564
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,281
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

565
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,784
and our clients
for the first time.

566
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,421
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Carrie and Chad.

567
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,222
They live here,

568
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,826
and they're raising these
four beautiful girls.

569
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,161
This is Layla. She's 5.

570
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,463
This is Tori, who is 10.

571
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,797
This is Gabbie, who is 3.

572
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,333
This is Ariana, who is 11.

573
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,169
Now we're here, so obviously,

574
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,338
you guys have a lot
of activity going on.

575
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,673
But the big issue here is Chad.

576
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,943
The whole family
is convinced he's changed

577
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,677
since he moved in here,

578
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,746
and if you can't help,

579
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,615
they say it's going
to rip their family apart.

580
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,149
With that being said,
I'm gonna ask Amy

581
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,286
to tell us about her walk.

582
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:41,691
When I first got here, I was
getting a lot of information.

583
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:47,564
So I go upstairs,
and I saw two living females

584
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,700
hiding behind a door.

585
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,436
They were reacting
to a living male

586
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,773
who was upset
and yelling and screaming.

587
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:59,109
I felt such anger
from the living man.

588
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,946
Like, he had murderous rage
coming out.

589
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,983
This living male had
gone through a complete change,

590
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:10,921
and I believe it's due
to an influence

591
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,724
that's within this house.

592
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:16,026
Wow. Carrie,
why don't you tell Amy

593
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,795
how you feel Chad's changed?

594
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:23,200
Before we moved in here, he used
to be a happy-go-lucky man.

595
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,736
Now, he's very
just depressed and angry.

596
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,672
So, Chad,
explain to Amy yourself

597
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,140
how you feel you've changed.

598
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,375
I don't know,

599
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:36,379
but the range inside of me
comes over me heavy, fast.

600
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:42,352
Sometimes, he just don't realize
that he is being very angry.

601
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:46,156
It hurts me to hurt my family
in any direction.

602
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,657
I'm seeing that you were

603
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,359
in some dark situations
in the past,

604
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:53,697
and that's making it easier for
what is here to influence you.

605
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,499
My background ain't good.

606
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,774
I saw an older man,

607
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:07,978
and this older dead male
is extremely active.

608
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980
There's a lot of ways

609
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,249
that living people
could experience him.

610
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:18,722
I thought maybe you would see
him because he is very solid.

611
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,990
Now, let's talk about
the tall shadow person

612
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,126
that you mentioned to me.

613
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,563
We will see him
shoot down the hallway.

614
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:31,001
My children also see
this tall shadow man.

615
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,237
He can also
be very physical.

616
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:38,007
I had extreme neck
and head pain the entire time,

617
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,210
and I saw him coming up

618
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,313
and smacking people
on the back of the head.

619
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,814
Carrie, do me a favor.

620
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,451
Just tell her about how you were
getting grabbed in the shower.

621
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,720
I have been grabbed
inappropriately in the shower.

622
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,824
I've been grabbed in my bed.

623
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,395
Now, Chad, you've been held down
in bed and choked, right?

624
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,797
- Yeah.
- So tell Amy what happened.

625
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,501
I couldn't move.
I was being held down.

626
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,369
It was like being suffocated.

627
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,840
Next thing I know, the bed is
in the middle of the room.

628
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,341
Could that be this guy?

629
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,311
Yeah. Definitely.

630
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,846
There's nothing I can
do about it.

631
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,781
That is what drives me
the most crazy.

632
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:21,651
It angers me, and I've...
I feed off of it.

633
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,388
I just want to get ahold of it.

634
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,723
Can this guy do anything else?

635
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:30,393
He can make you
really, really dizzy,

636
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,996
and I just saw
people falling,

637
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,466
and I also saw him
picking up a woman

638
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,870
and throwing her down
the stairs.

639
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,573
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

640
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,713
When you take a look at this,
you'll know you're not crazy.

641
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,483
Wow.

642
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,353
My god.

643
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,488
That is just insane.

644
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,225
Do me a favor and describe
to Amy what happened.

645
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,627
I was coming down the stairs,

646
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:07,230
and I felt just
this big blow to my back,

647
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,766
and I went all the way
down the steps.

648
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:13,169
I wish I could shoot
the son of a bitch.

649
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,005
Did you get any sense
of who you think this guy was

650
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,239
when he was alive?

651
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,742
I got that he did, in fact,
live here.

652
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:22,646
I was putting him in the '70s
or the '80s,

653
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:26,083
maybe, you know,
the very start of the '90s.

654
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,419
When he lived here,

655
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,756
he experienced hauntings
as well.

656
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,661
I had met a woman outside,

657
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:43,333
and she said that he was
abusive towards her,

658
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,935
and I felt like
that was his wife.

659
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,606
The wife told me that
he had died somewhere else

660
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:53,777
but had been sucked back
to this house.

661
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:58,015
I know exactly
who she's talking about.

662
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,749
Well, Amy, there's something
you should know.

663
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,351
Chad's grandparents lived
in this house

664
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,787
from the day it was built
in the early '60s...

665
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,623
...until they gave it to Chad
a few years ago...

666
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,826
...upon their passing.
Do me a favor.

667
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:13,730
Why don't you describe
your grandfather to Amy for me?

668
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,832
My grandpa was very old-school.

669
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,534
He didn't like women.

670
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,504
He didn't like my mom.
He didn't like my sister.

671
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,906
He didn't like my grandmother.

672
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,375
He was a very angry man.

673
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:29,179
And I've been telling him
since day one that

674
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:33,450
that angry man that I see
is his grandfather,

675
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:38,187
and I knew that his grandfather
did not like women,

676
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,655
and I felt
that he was the one

677
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,992
that did not want me
in this home.

678
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,795
Now I got a photo of him
when he was younger,

679
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,631
and then I have another one here
as much older.

680
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,371
Now you think his grandfather
is the guy you saw?

681
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,105
I had a sketch done.

682
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,942
You guys tell me.

683
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,978
My heart's pounding.

684
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,682
My.

685
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,153
That looks like my pops.

686
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,854
Not my dad, my pops.

687
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,490
All right,
so let's get this cleared up.

688
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,825
Who is that?

689
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,693
Chad's grandfather's cousin.

690
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,161
His grandfather's cousin. Okay.

691
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,029
Now did he ever spend time
in this house?

692
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,866
Yes, he did, off and on.

693
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,434
Interesting.

694
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,436
Now do you remember this guy
and what he was like?

695
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,703
What kind of man he was?

696
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,639
He was a violent man.
That's what I remember.

697
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,908
And he was a violent man
up to his death.

698
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,879
He was abused by his dad,
and my grandma brought him in.

699
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:39,148
Took him in as a child.

700
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,450
It looks just like him.

701
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,054
Okay. Anything else?

702
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:50,527
So I saw this dead little girl
playing in the backyard.

703
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,830
I thought that maybe
you might see her

704
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,266
'cause she is
very physical.

705
00:33:56,268 --> 00:34:00,804
So this child showed me
a location in the backyard

706
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:03,440
where she had been murdered.

707
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:06,576
This person who murdered her

708
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:12,416
is, basically, everything
that's going on here.

709
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,318
I got that she knew the person
who murdered her,

710
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,453
and the thing about her

711
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,792
is that she sees
this murderer as a monster.

712
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,627
What I saw was
black skeleton arms

713
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,797
and then, like,
a black, like, you know,

714
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,767
the tar when you pour it,
and it's bubbly hot?

715
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,936
So the body is like that.

716
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,838
Because of how this
little kid was dressed,

717
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,342
I put her
in the 1870s, 1880s.

718
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,377
Not a ton to go on,
but there was a murder

719
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,579
you described
sounds like something

720
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,748
I came across in research.

721
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,084
Now back in 1837, this rich guy
named Thomas Brandt

722
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,989
bought 70,000 acres
of land in Flint.

723
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,458
Your house sits
right in the middle of it.

724
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,794
I got a photo of Brandt.

725
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,797
This is guy who bought
the property originally.

726
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:04,400
He had a daughter named
Charlotte, and she was in love

727
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,402
with a tenant farmer
named Davillo Palmer

728
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,406
who lived right next door
to your house.

729
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:12,175
Charlotte's mother, Francisca,
didn't approve of this guy

730
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,409
and, you know, for good reason.

731
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,345
Guy was married.

732
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,247
At some point,
Charlotte winds up

733
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,382
getting pregnant
with Palmer's kid.

734
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:22,218
Days later,
Palmer's wife goes missing.

735
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,689
Now records were
pretty bad back then,

736
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,559
but the historian I spoke to
said that they believe

737
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,495
there was a child as well
that also went missing.

738
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,231
- Wow.
- Damn.

739
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,835
And this is, literally, right
next to where your house sits.

740
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,103
Police flagged him
for the murders

741
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:41,404
but couldn't make a case.

742
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:44,174
So Palmer never went
to trial, nothing.

743
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,509
So Palmer and Charlotte
get married,

744
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,879
and they have a kid
4 months later.

745
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,247
Now, it gets better.

746
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:53,416
In 1859, Charlotte's mother,
Francisca, was murdered

747
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,451
by being poisoned with arsenic.

748
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,987
Now Palmer was a suspect,

749
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,655
and before the cops
could even talk to him,

750
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,291
he took off
and fell off the planet.

751
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,660
Considering Palmer may
have killed his wife, his child,

752
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,927
and his mother-in-law,

753
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,731
and this all happened
in the 1850s,

754
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,800
you think this is the person
who that could be?

755
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,504
If, in fact, he did kill his
wife and kid,

756
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,207
and then...yeah.

757
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,942
Now you mentioned
this tar thing is everything.

758
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,143
What do you mean by that?

759
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,345
It used to be a human being,

760
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,748
and it's been here
since it died.

761
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,220
The thing about it is that
it'll lie dormant for years.

762
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:36,259
Only when it sees somebody who
matches its same degree of anger

763
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,295
and potential violence.

764
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,162
That is what triggers it.

765
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,700
And then
it can influence them.

766
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,735
So it sounds like this tar thing

767
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:49,105
is trying to use Chad here
to hurt other living people.

768
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,910
Pisses me off so bad.
It pisses me off.

769
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,913
So, Carrie, it sounds like
you were right.

770
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,715
Something was influencing
your husband.

771
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:03,453
I do feel relieved
knowing that.

772
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:08,792
But it's just still hard to --
to cope with all of this.

773
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,860
Now let me ask you a question
about this tar thing, though.

774
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,328
<i>Why</i> is it going after Chad?

775
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,864
I mean,
what's the purpose of it?

776
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,467
This...person

777
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,202
was a child murderer.

778
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,806
He's insane,
potentially a serial killer.

779
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,343
So obviously, he just wants
to continue doing the same

780
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,345
and making violence happen,

781
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,682
hoping for the end result
to be murder.

782
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,484
If you kill
another adult, great.

783
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,419
If you kill a kid,
even better.

784
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,690
Could the things that are here
influence him enough

785
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,725
to maybe hurt these kids?

786
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:44,694
That's what
I'm worried about.

787
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,231
I love my babies.
I'd die for my babies.

788
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,435
I knew this was what it was.

789
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:56,439
I knew, deep down,
he had bad attachments to him.

790
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,808
And I keep telling him
and telling him,

791
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,676
and he doesn't want
to believe me.

792
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:04,514
I just didn't think
it was this...this bad.

793
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,249
It makes me want to explode.

794
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:25,952
Carrie, Chad,
I know this has been

795
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:27,420
a rough night on both of you.

796
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:28,822
But we know two things --

797
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:33,560
you're not crazy, and you
called us in just in time.

798
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,363
Now to answer
the big important question.

799
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:40,100
Can you stay here
with your four daughters,

800
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:42,469
and if you can,
what's it gonna take?

801
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:44,570
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

802
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,478
It's going to take
a little bit of work,

803
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,481
but there is a way for you
to stay here safely.

804
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:58,418
First, you need to find
a male medium

805
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,686
who is tough,

806
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:04,157
and that's because
this killer

807
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,895
is a psychopathic,
tough male.

808
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:12,364
He needs someone
that can match him

809
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:15,068
in attitude and stance.

810
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,471
You also need to find
a chaos magician,

811
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:20,873
and that also needs
to be a male.

812
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,075
These two males need
to come here.

813
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:25,211
They need to go out
into the backyard,

814
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:29,416
and the male medium will summon
the killer to come.

815
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,818
He'll come with
the little girl.

816
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,754
The chaos magician is going
to trap the killer

817
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:40,226
and then send him
to the other side.

818
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:43,163
The little girl is gonna
remain behind,

819
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:47,367
and the male medium will
take care of moving her on.

820
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,771
Then these two males are gonna
come inside the house

821
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,573
and they're going to do
the same thing

822
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,908
to take care of this guy.

823
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,043
Pops.

824
00:39:57,045 --> 00:40:00,380
And this will take
probably about 24 hours

825
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:03,316
for this whole process
to take place.

826
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,117
So once that's done,

827
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,321
those dead energies,
they'll be gone.

828
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,991
But you'll still have
your attachments.

829
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:16,930
A Reiki master needs
to come for four sessions.

830
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:20,666
They will focus on getting
your personal living energy

831
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,536
all aligned and clean.

832
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:26,873
After that, you're going
to need to work on

833
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:30,209
letting go psychologically
of your past.

834
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:33,812
You need to go see
a psychotherapist.

835
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:38,151
It's hard 'cause you are
going to relive

836
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:41,888
the worst experiences
you've had in your life,

837
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,059
but you're going to feel
so much lighter,

838
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:51,631
and it's not going
to haunt you any more.

839
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:55,234
You willing to do that?

840
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,904
I'm going to do
whatever I got to do.

841
00:40:57,906 --> 00:41:01,641
Ready to do it.
Ready to get it done.

842
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:03,943
I'm tired
of living like this.

843
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,778
I'd rather have him back
to the way he was

844
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,314
before we moved in here.

845
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,983
Once they take these steps,
will things get better here?

846
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,721
You're gonna feel
a<i> huge</i> difference,

847
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,757
huge difference.
- It's a win-win situation.

848
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,258
You'll get your husband back,

849
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,327
and you get to keep the house
your grandparents left you.

850
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,628
Right.

851
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,932
I'm so amazed
by all this right now.

852
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:27,867
It's overwhelming.

853
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:31,337
I really hope
Chad and Carrie

854
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:33,606
contact a medium
and a chaos magician

855
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:37,009
to remove the dead
terrorizing their family.

856
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,411
And with the help
of a therapist,

857
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,147
Chad can free himself
of negative attachments,

858
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,482
allowing this family to find

859
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:44,217
the peace
it's been looking for.
