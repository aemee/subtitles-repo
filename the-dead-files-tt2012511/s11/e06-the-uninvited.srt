1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,145
It's another dimension.

2
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:16,181
The energy is insane.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,350
It's attacking my kids.

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,486
The threat level is high.

5
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,189
He was found with his head
blowed off with a shotgun.

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,193
He met with
an unfortunate accident.

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,395
I can't sleep.
I can't do anything.

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,632
This is a very bad space.

9
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,135
This is not a good situation.

10
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,036
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,605
There's death here.

12
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,340
Don't wanna go down there.

13
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,608
I see dead people.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,710
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

15
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,379
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,215
She's definitely
a serial killer.

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,084
...and they speak to me.

18
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,219
She's going to torture them.

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,956
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,092
They were all murdered.

21
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,593
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,262
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,996
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,732
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,302
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,307
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

27
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,009
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,644
Who do you think
possessed you?

29
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,813
But Steve and I
never speak...

30
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,881
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,115
...until the very end.

32
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,717
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,819
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,388
<i>Hell,</i> no.

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,956
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,991
Everyone is in jeopardy.

37
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,141
I'm in Slaughters, Kentucky.

38
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,276
It's a tiny town
with a strange name,

39
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,278
about 2 hours north
of Nashville.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,947
I got a call
from a woman named Holly.

41
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,948
Now, she says whatever
is in her house

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,750
already wrecked her marriage

43
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,953
and now it's going after
her kids.

44
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,021
She's really praying we can
help her out.

45
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,560
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

46
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,029
of any leading information.

47
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,967
Photographs, religious texts,

48
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,169
even dream catchers
can influence her findings,

49
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,707
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

50
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,244
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,856
Wow.

52
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,593
Dreams -- big issue here.

53
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,396
There's a thing in the dreams
people experience,

54
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,067
and it's not good.

55
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,269
And the thing about the dreams

56
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,872
is that you can't
fully remember,

57
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:57,242
like, everything that happens,
but it's super bad.

58
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,013
I'm not sure about this yet,

59
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:05,216
but if it is taking
living energy from people,

60
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,552
in the end, they would die.

61
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,893
You know, Holly,
I speak to a lot of people

62
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,361
who really want us
to come investigate,

63
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,696
but when I spoke to you,

64
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,633
the sound of desperation
was...through the roof.

65
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,302
It is. We've been living
with this for a lot of years,

66
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,804
and it's just getting worse,

67
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,507
and it's time to do
something about it

68
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,708
'cause I can't do it
anymore.

69
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,643
I can't protect everybody.

70
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,712
Now on the phone, you said
that whatever is going on here

71
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,046
wrecked your marriage.

72
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,614
How long have you guys
been separated?

73
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,816
About 2 years.

74
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,184
Who else is living here?

75
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,953
Well, here's a picture.

76
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,155
This is Frank.

77
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,990
Okay. So what's the story
with Frank?

78
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,658
He's been a good friend
of ours.

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,159
You guys aren't boyfriend
and girlfriend?

80
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,994
No, mnh-mnh. No, just
a real good friend.

81
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,730
He's like a rock.

82
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,032
Okay. Who else
is in the picture?

83
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,667
That's my son, Ryan.

84
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,536
- He's 11.
- Okay.

85
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:02,474
Me, and my daughter, Tila,
she's 24, and her fiancé, John.

86
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,442
He's 28.

87
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,744
Tell me what you guys
are going through.

88
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,912
Well, we're hearing voices.

89
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,682
We're seeing shadow figures.

90
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,418
People are having
health problems, you know,

91
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,889
physical attacks
and personality changes.

92
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,224
When you say
personality changes,

93
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,092
you talking about
your husband?

94
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,296
Yes. Sean was
a very fun-loving man.

95
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,431
He was happy.

96
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,434
And, just, he became...

97
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,636
mean.

98
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,171
He'd pick fights with me.

99
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,707
If Amy comes right out
and says,

100
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,845
"Listen, the paranormal in this
house caused Sean to change,"

101
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,182
would you consider, then, maybe
trying to get back with him?

102
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,685
I still love him,
but I don't know.

103
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,522
A lot has been said and done
that's very painful.

104
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,723
What do you think is here?

105
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,925
I think that there's
something very dark.

106
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,794
I think it's something evil.

107
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,408
This is wrong.

108
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,743
I heard "chaos."

109
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,146
I heard a fight in here
between two living people.

110
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,950
And I see a male,

111
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:23,020
and he's extremely upset,

112
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,890
and he's over this...

113
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,527
I'm assuming, a woman,
yelling at her.

114
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,432
She's crying,
and he's just going off,

115
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,100
yelling, yelling, yelling.

116
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,603
Woman's freaking out,
crying, crying, crying.

117
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,510
All right. So what's
going on in this room?

118
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,112
One day, I walked in here.

119
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,847
I was super frustrated,

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,384
and, I said, out loud,

121
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,286
"I sure ain't gonna
stay here,"

122
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,321
and I heard this voice,
like, right here,

123
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,990
right next to me, "Why?"

124
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,126
It was a male voice,
just as plain as day,

125
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,260
like somebody
was standing there,

126
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,462
but there was nobody there.

127
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,130
Was the radio on,
maybe something else

128
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,598
that could've made
that noise?

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,299
No, there was nothing on.

130
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,002
That's a little creepy.
Have you ever heard that again?

131
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,539
Yes. He tries to talk
to me, calls my name.

132
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,074
All right.
So anything else?

133
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:20,211
When I'm here, I feel
sickness and, um, despair.

134
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,147
Describe the despair
you feel.

135
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,882
The other day --
I'll give you an example.

136
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,082
I'm cleaning in here

137
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,819
and I started feeling
really depressed,

138
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,288
and I just felt like,
"Jeez, what's it all worth?"

139
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,757
and just, out of the blue,
just started to cry.

140
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,893
You also mentioned sickness.

141
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,362
I have pain in my stomach,
generally on the right side.

142
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,032
It's stabbing, like I'm being
stabbed with something.

143
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,967
And how are you feeling,
now that we're in here?

144
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,468
It hurts.

145
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,039
It's just pushing,
pushing real hard.

146
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,975
Okay.

147
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,980
Ew.

148
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,385
Don't like this place.

149
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,719
It's almost
like you walk in here,

150
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,624
and it's just
squishing you down.

151
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,058
I don't like it in there.

152
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,096
İt's<i> bad</i> in there.

153
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,400
I feel nauseous, sick...

154
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,370
And dizzy.

155
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,706
Like, when I say dizzy, like,
this is...intense dizziness.

156
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,378
There's no ground here at all.

157
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,617
I feel like the living, if they
spend time in this area,

158
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,821
would become
extraordinarily depressed.

159
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,590
They would lose time in here.

160
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,627
That's the thing here is, like,
dreams and reality,

161
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,330
there's, like, no line here.

162
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,799
This is a very bad space.

163
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,107
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

164
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,776
One night, when I come up
to go to bed,

165
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,178
I'd seen a shadow figure,
humped out,

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,780
kind of leaning over like it
was gonna get on the bed.

167
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,216
What did it do?

168
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,517
It turned quick to look at me
and then just disappeared.

169
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,319
All right.
So anything else?

170
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,987
I hear my door open,

171
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,391
and I see this shadow
of a man peeking in.

172
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,593
Okay, so it looks like
the shadow figure you see.

173
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,595
Sometimes.

174
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,863
What do you mean
"sometimes"?

175
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,732
Sometimes, it'd look like
Sean, my husband.

176
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,201
- Is he here?
- No, no.

177
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,403
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

178
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,006
I went and checked.
Nobody was here.

179
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,908
How the hell
do you sleep here?

180
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,576
Well, I have nightmares.

181
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,178
What kind of nightmares?

182
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,213
Always
fighting something evil.

183
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,214
I've always remembered
all of my dreams.

184
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:41,886
These here
are very, very bad.

185
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,355
I love my home,
but I sometimes

186
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,091
just don't even want to
be here anymore.

187
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,926
Okay.

188
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,563
There's a thing that's
giving everyone nightmares.

189
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,767
I think that thing is
on the ceiling.

190
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,168
Can you describe it?

191
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,703
The closest thing
would be, like,

192
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,773
a cross between a little dragon
and a gargoyle,

193
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,176
but it has the long arms, like,
the spider arms.

194
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,446
How would the living experience
the dream state from this thing?

195
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,315
Like they're having a dream,

196
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:13,685
but the experiences they're
having in the dream are real,

197
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,489
so the whole thing gets
all kinds of crazy and fuzzy

198
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,558
in their head as far as
what's real, what's not real.

199
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,563
I wouldn't want to stay here.

200
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,151
So, Ryan, how old are you?

201
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,119
-11.
- It seems like everybody

202
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,654
is having experiences
in the house.

203
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,289
Now what about you?

204
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,329
He had a hat on,
like a war hat.

205
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,530
Could you see through
this person,

206
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,864
or was this somebody
that was...

207
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,399
He was black.

208
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,701
Did you think it was
a dream?

209
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,002
No.

210
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,203
Okay, Ryan.
Anything else?

211
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,738
I get tired.

212
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,339
What do you think
it could be?

213
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,910
He's trying to make me go
to sleep and give me nightmares.

214
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,212
Okay, so you think it could be
that man you saw.

215
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,547
Yeah.

216
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,616
So, Ryan, how would you feel
if we were able to get

217
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,651
all the bad spirits
out of the house?

218
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,821
I think it would make
my family feel better,

219
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,289
and I think the air
would let up.

220
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,758
Okay.

221
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,664
It feels like I'm on

222
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,766
the teacup ride

223
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,934
when it spins like crazy.

224
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:41,373
The energy
is...insane in this room.

225
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,974
It's super bad.

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,310
Nobody should go in this room.

227
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,645
I think the living are seeing it
as a shadow person,

228
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,047
but it's not.

229
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,515
It's that...that thing is,

230
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,718
the dragon/gargoyle thing.

231
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Then it gets really little

232
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:59,090
and it crawls down
the closet door.

233
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:03,528
It is affecting the living
here, where a child sleeps.

234
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,197
That thing enters
people's dreams,

235
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,068
but they don't necessarily
have to be completely asleep.

236
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,669
It scares the kid.

237
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,839
This thing is just
taking his energy.

238
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,908
What is this?

239
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,816
So, Frank, I was talking
to Holly today.

240
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,719
She was telling me about all
the stuff going on here.

241
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,021
Now she said that you guys
have been friends a long time.

242
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,455
Yeah, about 6 years.

243
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,490
Nothing romantic
with you and her.

244
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,959
No, no, just friends.

245
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,828
Okay, so I know everybody is
having experiences in the house.

246
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,831
- How about you?
- I have a lot of chest pains.

247
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,367
Can you describe how you're
feeling with these chest pains?

248
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,302
I got a stab right here,
right through.

249
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,438
It's funny you mention
a stabbing pain

250
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,907
'cause Holly told me about
a stabbing pain she gets.

251
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,442
Yeah.

252
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,710
Do you think it's paranormal,
you having these problems?

253
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,779
I think so, because when
I leave here, they go away.

254
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,980
Anything else?

255
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,849
I've been pushed down
the stairs, once.

256
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,051
Okay. Did you get hurt?

257
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,386
I grabbed the rail beside me

258
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,588
and put my hand on
the wall in front of me.

259
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,191
So you didn't make it
down the stairs.
No.

260
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,192
So you're pretty lucky.
You could have got killed.
Yeah.

261
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,233
I feel like I'm being hit
on the left side,

262
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,302
in my temple,

263
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:20,204
very sharp blow
to the left temple.

264
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,339
Um...

265
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,274
Is that
the dragon-gargoyle thing?

266
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,176
I think so.

267
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,112
I think it's hitting people.

268
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,014
Does it do
anything else physical?

269
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,382
Yes.

270
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,694
I was talking to your mom.
She's going through a lot.

271
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,131
She thinks that the house
changed Sean

272
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,233
and it destroyed
the marriage.

273
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,568
Do you agree with that?

274
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,904
Yeah, definitely has to do
with this house.

275
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,809
My mom and dad, all of us
have always been really close.

276
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,910
All right.
Now what about you?

277
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,978
Have you had any changes
in your personality?

278
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,181
I just feel really
depressed and tired,

279
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,384
and I'm just not me
in this house.

280
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,554
Seems like everybody is
having experiences in the house.

281
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,189
Pretty confident you have?

282
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,925
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's talk about 'em.

283
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,526
I have these nightmares.

284
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,962
Okay. Can you
describe the dreams?

285
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,131
I've seen this man,

286
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,234
and he's physically
harming me.

287
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,335
He will choke me.

288
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,338
He will grab my ribs,
and he always says

289
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,974
if I tell anybody,
he's going to hurt me.

290
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,211
I've actually had time
where I have woken up before,

291
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:37,148
and I had, like,
scratches all down my neck

292
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,550
where I guess
I had been struggling back.

293
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,819
Okay, so you think
you did the scratches,

294
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,421
trying to stop yourself
from being choked.

295
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,755
Yeah.

296
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,357
And this is happening
every night?

297
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,792
Pretty much every night.

298
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,294
All right.
That's no way to live.

299
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,896
No, it's not.

300
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,665
I just
want to be able to sleep.

301
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,834
Yeah. It doesn't sound
like you can, honey.

302
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,203
Yeah. I feel like
I'm the target,

303
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,438
and that just everybody
is in the way.

304
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,872
Okay.

305
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,709
I don't know what I did.

306
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,610
Anything else?

307
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,580
I've seen this thing
crawl across my bed.

308
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,048
Okay. I know you guys got
a lot of animals here.

309
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,785
At that point, I didn't have
no animals in my room.

310
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,186
So what did it look like?

311
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:19,424
Like a dog, but its back legs
were, like, very deformed.

312
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,994
Okay. That must have scared
the hell out of you.

313
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,629
Yeah.

314
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,598
It just wasn't
a good feeling at all.

315
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,865
Anything else happening?

316
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,801
Just before you got here,
I tried to lay down,

317
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:35,239
and I...
my heart starts racing

318
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,342
and I lose my breath,

319
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,144
and it feels like
a weight's on me,

320
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,113
and I just know
he's laying on top of me.

321
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,584
Is it the same man
from your dreams?

322
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,587
Okay.

323
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,556
I can't sleep.
I can't do anything.

324
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,894
He's following me around.
He's laying on top of me.

325
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,430
I don't know what I did.

326
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,132
Sweetie, you didn't do
anything.

327
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,101
We'll get through this together
and we'll figure something out.

328
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,835
Okay?

329
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,437
That sound like a plan?

330
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,906
It sounds like
a really nice one.

331
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,613
This is horrible.

332
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,150
I'm seeing a living person,
so I don't know

333
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,253
if this is
the kind of possession.

334
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,521
Like, when I think
of possession,

335
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,789
I think of, like, a demon.

336
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:31,663
This is an alien-type
possession,

337
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,732
possibly an experiment.

338
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,800
Is the dragon-gargoyle thing
doing this?

339
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,870
- Yes.
- So it's an alien?

340
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,604
Yes.

341
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,907
How is this affecting
the living person?

342
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,811
It's erasing that person.

343
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,880
Like, that person
and that personality

344
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,683
before this
does not exist anymore.

345
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,286
They're not even, like,
human anymore.

346
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:01,225
To us human beings,
these things are bad.

347
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,560
Why?

348
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,962
Torturing children,

349
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,067
they possibly caused somebody
to kill themselves.

350
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,102
They try to kill people.

351
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,069
This town is tiny --
218 people.

352
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,538
Everybody knows
everybody's business,

353
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,306
so when I called
the local genealogist,

354
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,275
she knew all about
Holly's property.

355
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:36,277
Turns out, a family that
used to live there

356
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,545
suffered some tragic deaths

357
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:38,946
I'm definitely gonna want
to know about.

358
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:47,421
So, Mandee, this family
that suffered

359
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,791
right around my client's
property, who were they?

360
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:52,526
It was
Sally and A.J. Couch.

361
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:55,463
They actually bought
the property in 1910.

362
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:57,331
Okay. Now, you said
there were some deaths.

363
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,599
When was the first one?

364
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,868
It was actually a few years
prior to that.

365
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,537
They had a year-old son
that passed away.

366
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:04,772
Did they have
any other kids?

367
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,340
- Yes. They had four daughters.
- All right.

368
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,342
So what happened after they
moved onto the land there?

369
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:12,413
Everything was going good
until 1933.

370
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,649
A.J. ended up dying at 63.

371
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,951
He had an inflamed heart.

372
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,054
Pretty much this whole family
had heart problems.

373
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:25,593
I'm seeing a male here.

374
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:26,994
He lived here,

375
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,130
and he was probably in his 60s.

376
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,666
And I'm also getting
that choking feeling.

377
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,968
I cannot stop it.
I cannot swallow.

378
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,771
And then struggling.

379
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,177
The old man died,

380
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,948
and he's being taken in
by these gargoyle things.

381
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,722
He's just being wrapped
and taken in to the darkness.

382
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,627
Okay, so Sally's lost
her baby boy and her husband.

383
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:01,395
- Are there any more deaths?
- Yes.

384
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:05,500
In 1938, their daughter, Lockie,
dies of a hysterectomy

385
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,937
while she was actually
on the surgery table.

386
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,507
And then here's
her death certificate.

387
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,908
She was
only 40 years old.

388
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,943
Anything else?

389
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,178
In 1947 in August,

390
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,248
Sally actually has
a heart attack

391
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,816
and dies as well.

392
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,884
You know, I always expect
to see deaths on a property,

393
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,786
especially with people
there that long,

394
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,855
but when you said "untimely,"
you were right.

395
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,524
I mean, a few of these
are really sooner

396
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,892
than it should have been.

397
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,863
Do you know where
these dragon-gargoyle things

398
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,398
are taking the old man?

399
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,068
They're taking him to
this hole outside.

400
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,603
It's very large.

401
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,273
I think the hole
is another dimension.

402
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,945
It's been around forever.

403
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:54,282
It only lets things out
that are negative.

404
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,020
The gargoyle came
from this hole.

405
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:07,228
I think that thing
within this hole

406
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,230
can take people.

407
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,965
It takes the souls.

408
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,635
So far, I've got
a client who believes

409
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,604
the paranormal destroyed
her marriage

410
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,940
on a property where
at least two people died.

411
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:22,977
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

412
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,646
Searching through old records,
I come across Stephen Coffman,

413
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:27,982
who used to own
my client's land.

414
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:30,585
Turns out his nephew and his son
were brutally murdered

415
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,987
within 6 years of each other.

416
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,457
I've tracked down
a local crime writer

417
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,992
who used to be a cop.

418
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,993
Now he says the family
never saw justice

419
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,796
for either one
of those homicides.

420
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,268
Well, Steve, thanks
for meeting up with me.

421
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,669
I appreciate that.

422
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:49,904
What can you tell me
about the family

423
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,138
that owned
my client's property?

424
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,807
Stephen Osborne Coffman

425
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,645
inherited the property
around 1896.

426
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay, so take me through
the first homicide.

427
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:03,250
Well, the first homicide
occurred in 1899.

428
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:06,754
It involved
Oz's son, William.

429
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,990
He was 22 years of age.

430
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:12,826
He's in a bar with a friend
of his in Tennessee.

431
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,729
A guy comes out of
the bathroom.

432
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,097
He's 25.
His name is William Morrison.

433
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,735
Morrison had a reputation
not only as being this thug

434
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:23,371
but with a real nasty temper.

435
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:27,607
He feels that the Coffman boy
tripped him.

436
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,978
Morrison pulls out a weapon,
fires three times.

437
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,248
The Coffman boy goes down,
and he dies.

438
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,482
Okay, so what happens?

439
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,452
Morrison gets convicted.

440
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:41,055
About 21/2 years
into his sentence,

441
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,124
he escapes from prison.

442
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,727
He stays a fugitive
for almost 17 to 18 years.

443
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:47,961
All right.
Now there was two murders.

444
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:50,197
- Right.
- What was the second one?

445
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:53,900
The second homicide was
involving Stephen's son,

446
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,470
and his son's name
was William.

447
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,871
- Another William.
- Another William.

448
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,741
- Okay.
- This occurred on May 6, 1905.

449
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,143
Okay, so what happens?

450
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,012
Well, William is riding his
horse in Slaughters, Kentucky,

451
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:09,817
and he comes upon a neighbor
by the name of Paul Campbell.

452
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,251
- Okay.
- There is an argument,

453
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:14,321
and the argument,
evidently, got pretty heated,

454
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,957
and Paul draws a weapon

455
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,393
and shoots William.

456
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,095
He dies.

457
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:22,629
All right. So you told me
on the phone

458
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:24,632
they both got away
with murder here.
Right.

459
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:25,833
So what happened
with this kid, Paul?

460
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:28,035
The grand jury came back
and rendered a no bill.

461
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,437
He's not convicted.

462
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,871
He can walk a free man.

463
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,239
That's
a pretty messed-up story.

464
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,041
So the guy that owned my
client's property at the time,

465
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,577
Stephen Coffman,
loses a nephew...

466
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,579
...and a son
within a few years...

467
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:39,947
Right.
...both to murder.

468
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,649
Right.
And neither one of
those cases

469
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,584
really had
any justice at all.

470
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,785
That's correct.

471
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,557
I'm seeing a male out here.

472
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,393
He didn't get sucked into
the hole.

473
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,097
He gave it hell, and he won,

474
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,667
and he's here in this reality.

475
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:01,836
He was a tough...

476
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,871
And I do get that he was
a World War II vet.

477
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:07,008
Somebody says that he met
with an unfortunate accident.

478
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,947
He has tried to protect
living people.

479
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,417
He said he's tried to warn them
about this hole

480
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,485
and the dragon-gargoyle things,

481
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,220
and he said
it was a waste of his time

482
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,355
and a waste of his energy.

483
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:24,625
It made him sick, so finally,
he just stopped.

484
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,828
Now he doesn't bother.

485
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,031
He's like, "Trust me.
People got the...message.

486
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,833
They just didn't bother
to listen to it."

487
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,709

493
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,997
I'm heading out to meet
the local sheriff.

494
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:05,866
He was digging through
old records and found a case

495
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,734
I'm definitely interested in.

496
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:11,205
Turns out, a beloved deputy
was gunned down and killed here.

497
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,074
But then the town took matters
into its own hands

498
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,742
and got revenge.

499
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,819
Well, Sheriff,
thanks for meeting me here.

500
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,121
I appreciate that.

501
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:29,256
What can you tell me about
this murder you found?

502
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,024
In December of 1898,

503
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:35,463
Town Marshall William McGary
and Deputy Lorenzo Ashby

504
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:38,165
went to Henry Gooch's residence,
a local farmer,

505
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,302
to serve a warrant
for disturbing the peace.
All right.

506
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:43,637
So now, how far is this place
from my client's property?

507
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,440
Just
a few hundred yards away.

508
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,108
Okay, so what happens next?

509
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,378
Well, the three men were
standing out in the front lawn.

510
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,180
Jody, the son of Mr. Gooch,

511
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,518
walks up and shoots
both lawmen in the head.

512
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,386
Now are they both
dead on the scene?

513
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:01,789
No.
Amazingly, McGary ran off.

514
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,158
But he had to be
injured pretty bad.

515
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,261
- How bad was it?
- He had an eye put out.

516
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:08,662
Okay. Now what about
the other guy?

517
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:12,566
The partner, Mr. Ashby,
he went into a coma

518
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,268
and lingered around
for a few days,

519
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,136
and he died.
- Okay.

520
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:21,208
And here is some information
from the local paper.

521
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,475
All right.
So Jody is on the loose.

522
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,844
- Does he get arrested?
- Yes.

523
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:25,812
Now, Sheriff, you mentioned,
on the phone

524
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,480
that townspeople got
revenge.

525
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:28,749
What did you mean by that?

526
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:32,286
In June of 1899,
Henry Gooch,

527
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:34,755
he was found on the south end
of town in Slaughters

528
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:37,190
with his head blowed off,
probably with a shotgun.

529
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:41,228
Here's how the local newspaper
covered the story, Steve.

530
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,563
Okay, so now
this guy is dead.

531
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,598
- Did they arrest anybody for it?
- Yes.

532
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,934
Eventually, they arrested
William McGary.

533
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,635
He was the town marshal.

534
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:50,103
- He's the guy that...
- Lost his eye.

535
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:52,906
...lost his eye.
Okay. Did the marshal
go to trial?

536
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,874
- Yes, he did.
- Okay?

537
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:57,144
And he was found
not guilty.

538
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,846
So what happened
with this kid, Jody Gooch,

539
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:00,114
who started this whole mess?

540
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:03,450
Jody was found guilty
in December of 1899

541
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:06,753
and convicted of manslaughter
and sentenced to 8 years.

542
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,556
Strangely, Steve,
a few years later,

543
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,993
he was pardoned by the governor
and released in 1902.

544
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:15,296
Okay, so this kid only serves
3 years for this whole thing?

545
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,597
Yes.

546
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,199
Now when he gets out,
does he stay in Slaughters?

547
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,467
No. He leaves Slaughters
and never comes back.

548
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:21,534
Well, he was smarter
than his father,

549
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,137
that's for sure.
- That's right.

550
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,011
What do these dragon-gargoyle
things want from the living?

551
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,881
They seem to just be taking us

552
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:36,650
and causing us to die.

553
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:44,291
They're actually
taking energy of people.

554
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,032
So how much danger
would you say

555
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,367
people living here
would be in from this?

556
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,704
...A lot.

557
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:03,576
You have people who have been
influenced enough to die,

558
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:07,180
and you have a child
who is giving its energy

559
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:08,648
over to this thing,

560
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,154
so I would say that the threat
level here is relatively high.

561
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:24,798
This was
a very disturbing walk,

562
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,536
but the dragon-gargoyle thing
is clearly the biggest threat.

563
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:33,674
This thing was coming out
of the darkness.

564
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:40,147
Very bulbous eyes,
daddy long leg arms.

565
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:44,051
It was, like,
crawling down the closet.-

566
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:55,128
Next, I described this creature
possessing a living woman.

567
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,764
This person,

568
00:26:56,766 --> 00:27:01,568
their bones, everything
was turning black.

569
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,237
Their heart has turned
fully black.

570
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,973
They have an evil smile.

571
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,647
Amy, is this what
you saw?

572
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,250
Yes.

573
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:38,205
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

574
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:40,641
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

575
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:43,377
and our clients
for the first time.

576
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:47,114
Amy, this is Holly
and her daughter, Tila.

577
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:49,849
Let's just say these guys
really need our help.

578
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:54,154
They share this house
with three guys.

579
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:56,589
This is Tila's fiancé, John.

580
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,960
This is Holly's friend, Frank,
and this is Holly's son, Ryan,

581
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:01,694
who is 11 years old.

582
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,198
Everyone is
experiencing activity,

583
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
but my heart really goes out
to Tila.

584
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:07,801
She's going through
a hell of a time

585
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:11,004
and is convinced the activity
is all her fault.

586
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:12,739
Now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

587
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,575
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk.

588
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:21,615
This was a very interesting
walk, to say the least.

589
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:28,054
I was upstairs in the pretty big
bedroom, and it was really big.

590
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:30,890
I encountered
a residual impression

591
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,693
of two people arguing.

592
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:36,496
One was a male, probably
in his mid-to-late 40s,

593
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,099
and he was kind of
standing over this woman,

594
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,167
who was seated in a chair.

595
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:44,504
He was all screaming at her
because he didn't believe

596
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,708
what she was describing,
experience-wise.

597
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,710
She was crying
and freaking out.

598
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:51,578
And it was odd to me
because I knew

599
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,714
that the man had
had experiences himself,

600
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:57,717
so that was
a little upsetting.

601
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,520
You know, Holly,
that sounds a lot like

602
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:02,523
you and your estranged
husband, Sean.

603
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:04,725
He would get
extremely angry.

604
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:07,361
I would try to tell him
what you just described,

605
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:09,396
and he said,
"Well, call me crazy.

606
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,132
I don't see anything.
Nothing happens here."

607
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:14,968
- Did he have experiences?
- Yes.

608
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,973
He was the love of my life.

609
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,374
- He was just...
- I'm sorry.

610
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:24,410
...so sweet, and then
just, he was mean.

611
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,980
Wow, that's bad.

612
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,549
- Yeah.
- Very bad.

613
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:35,055
So what else?

614
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:38,959
I went outside, um,
by the little sheds,

615
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,561
and I saw this dead man,

616
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:44,798
and he had on overalls
and a little cap.

617
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,601
He used to try
and protect the living

618
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,304
from something
dangerous outside,

619
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,573
and then he said that
he stopped.

620
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:57,578
He just stopped doing it
because nobody was listening.

621
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,114
I got that he was
a World War II vet

622
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:04,585
and that he's really tough
but overall,

623
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,120
a really good person
at heart,

624
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:09,389
and then unfortunately,
I got that he did die

625
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:13,360
in a really terrible
accident.

626
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,062
I didn't come across anybody
in my research

627
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,263
that was a World War II vet.

628
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,600
But does it sound like anybody
you guys know?

629
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:22,135
My dad was
a World War II veteran.

630
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:25,038
- Wow.
- Did he die in a bad accident?

631
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,541
- Yes.
- Wow.

632
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:30,444
My dad was on top
of the tractor,

633
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:31,711
driving down the road,

634
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:35,082
and the man was joking around,
swerving behind him,

635
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,217
when he hit the back
of the tractor

636
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,785
and went overtop of my dad.

637
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:41,288
My god.

638
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,423
So, Holly, it sounds like
your Pop is out there,

639
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,291
looking out for you guys.

640
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:48,395
It makes me want to cry.

641
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,563
Were you close with him?

642
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,598
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,501
I've had a hard time forgiving
the man that hit him.

644
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:57,237
This man cheated me.
It hurts.

645
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,671
I know.

646
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,244
So what else happened
on the walk?

647
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:09,716
So the next entity that I saw
is really the main problem.

648
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,251
It's kind of unusual.

649
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:15,522
Like I said, this was
a very interesting case.

650
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:17,824
It can take on
multiple forms.

651
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:23,397
It looks like a cross between,
like, a little dragon

652
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,001
and a gargoyle with
a little bit of a spider.

653
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:31,572
Never thought of that,
to use as description for it.

654
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:34,807
It was crawling across my bed.

655
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,677
It had a really long face.

656
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,279
The only way
I could describe it

657
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,815
was like a dog
with disfigured back legs.

658
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,920
- You okay?
- Yeah.

659
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:53,994
The living could also interpret
this as a shadow figure.

660
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:58,731
It can cause dizziness,
sickness, and nauseous.

661
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,767
It's also extremely physical.

662
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:04,270
At one point, it hit me
on the side of my head.

663
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:05,705
It felt like
I was getting punched.

664
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:07,673
A lot of what you talked about

665
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,944
is what the family
has been experiencing.

666
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:12,112
Holly, just tell Amy
how everybody

667
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:13,980
is getting sick in the house.

668
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,716
I feel a stabbing
in my right side.

669
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,554
Frank never had heart problems
until he moved into the house.

670
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:22,356
Now you said this thing
gets physical.

671
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,458
He was also telling me that
he was coming down the stairs.

672
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,795
Out of nowhere, he felt, like,
man hands pushed him.

673
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:31,531
Tila has been
physically attacked, too.

674
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:37,004
Yeah. It looks like a man
around 6-foot tall.

675
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:40,073
Whenever he's in my room,
he circles my bed,

676
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:43,477
and he taunts me, and I could
feel him laying on me,

677
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,046
and I can't breathe,
and I can't move.

678
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,680
I can't sleep.

679
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:56,556
The thing that was
concerning me the most,

680
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,059
upstairs in
the blue bathroom...

681
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,661
Okay. That's Ryan's room.

682
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:04,364
...I saw the same entity
slithering down the wall

683
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:08,234
to scare this kid.

684
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,571
One of the things
that this thing is doing

685
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:16,275
is draining the energy
from the child,

686
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:20,714
and I did
have a sketch done.

687
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,520
That's pretty freaky.

688
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,556
My god.

689
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:36,430
That's in Ryan's room?

690
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,931
I was worried about my brother.

691
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,601
I don't ever want him
going in there again.

692
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,470
You've seen that upstairs?

693
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:46,606
Yes, but it's...

694
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,941
not just upstairs.

695
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,146
What really freaked me out

696
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:56,149
is that it can enter
people's dreams.

697
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:59,553
It gives people horrible,
horrible nightmares.

698
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:02,456
The people don't even
have to be asleep.

699
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,160
I've had
some really bad dreams.

700
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:09,095
Had one last week
that Tila died.

701
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,564
I woke up.
My face was soaking wet.

702
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:13,166
I was balling my eyes out.

703
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:14,968
This man is always in my dream,

704
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:20,106
and he's always choking me,
or he's grabbing onto my ribs,

705
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:23,109
and I can actually feel
this pain when I wake up.

706
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,878
It actually feels like
breaking bones.

707
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,446
Now you had scratch marks.

708
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,715
Yeah.
They were all over my neck,

709
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:30,250
My mother, when I woke up,
she said,

710
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:33,086
"What'd you do to yourself?"

711
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,088
I was just trying to stop
from being choked.

712
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:44,197
On your property,
I saw this vast hole.

713
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,134
This hole has been there
since the beginning of time,

714
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:52,706
and very negative things
come out of this space

715
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,541
into our reality,

716
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:59,012
including the thing
I've been talking about.

717
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,582
This hole is basically
another dimension.

718
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,283
I would refer to these beings

719
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:09,523
as interdimensional
entities or aliens.

720
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:13,493
My god.

721
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:17,497
And the dreams that
you guys are having

722
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:21,067
are, in fact, not really
dreams at all.

723
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:25,405
It's actually happening
but in a different dimension.

724
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:30,243
They're taking you
into their reality,

725
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:32,979
and that's why they're
so extremely vivid

726
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:36,616
and...frightening,

727
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:41,054
'cause it's actually something
that is happening.

728
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,123
Okay. And these are aliens.

729
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,258
Yes.

730
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:51,598
I'm...overwhelmed.

731
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,535
I'm lost for words.
I don't know what to say.

732
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:57,938
I'm scared it's not
going to end.

733
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:03,310
Are you okay?

734
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:07,747
I'm not, but I will be.

735
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,951
To us, they're
extremely dangerous

736
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:14,453
because they do torture.

737
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,690
I'm seeing them
also kill people.

738
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:20,126
They will get people
to kill themselves,

739
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,494
and I think,
over the years,

740
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:26,699
a lot of people have died
around here because of them.

741
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,234
Now...

742
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,370
I don't know if this has
anything to do with aliens,

743
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:34,941
but there have been a lot of
strange deaths on your property.

744
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,177
For example, the Couch family
that lived in your house,

745
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:38,845
they moved in around 1910.

746
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,180
Now while they were here,

747
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:42,448
three family members died
way too young.

748
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,984
- Wow.
- I actually have

749
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:47,554
a stack of death certificates
right here for them.

750
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:48,988
Then we've got Stephen Coffman.

751
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,458
Now, in 1899,
Stephen's nephew, William,

752
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,028
got shot by a guy
in a bar in Tennessee.

753
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,396
This kid was 22
at the time of his death.

754
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:02,735
1905, his son was also 22, got
into a fight with a neighbor,

755
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,771
real close to where we are,

756
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,206
and the neighbor shot
and killed him.

757
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:12,011
Now, could these things
be responsible

758
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,613
for any of these deaths?

759
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,848
Definitely
a huge possibility.

760
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,955
So on the ground level,

761
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:24,924
the small bedroom

762
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:29,062
where, when you open
the door, you hit the bed...

763
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,830
That's Tila's room.

764
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,767
This thing
is targeting you.

765
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,171
And I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

766
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,778
I don't even know if I want
to show this to you.

767
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,414
Um...

768
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,792
I knew it was targeting me.
I knew it.

769
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:04,197
What exactly is
this thing trying to do to her?

770
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:09,369
It's taking over your soul.

771
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,174
But it's also affecting
you physically...

772
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:20,580
...and it's starting to
strip you of your humanity,

773
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:24,484
your personality, the you.

774
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:28,888
They're working towards
making you kill yourself.

775
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,191
My god.

776
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,561
I used to be always happy.
I...

777
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,096
When I'm at home,
I'm just depressed,

778
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:38,364
and I don't want
to do anything.

779
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,833
I'm so tired all the time.

780
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:41,668
You don't feel
like yourself anymore?

781
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,405
I'm sorry.

782
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:49,576
This is not something that
Tila brought on herself.

783
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,978
- Right?
- No.

784
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,247
We'll figure this out
one way or another. Okay?

785
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,083
Got to.
It's attacking my kids.

786
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,893
So sorry.

787
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:09,262
It's not your fault.

788
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,597
- I love you.
- I love you.

789
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,733
You know, I've worked with Amy
for over 6 years now,

790
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,701
and I thought I've heard
it all, but tonight,

791
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,636
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

792
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,838
Now one thing is obvious.

793
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,706
You probably have a lot of
work ahead of you,

794
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,442
and to find out what it's going
to take to get out of this mess,

795
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,044
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

796
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,614
Basically, this thing
is something

797
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,419
that has just
been there forever.

798
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,790
So given that, I think the best
thing you can do is to move...

799
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,163
...probably as quickly
as possible.

800
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:03,766
In the meantime, you should
get religious items,

801
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,235
put them all over the house,

802
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,904
and carry them
on yourselves as well.

803
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:12,708
Have these reblessed
every week until you move.

804
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,378
Once you vacate
the property,

805
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,149
you need an exorcism done

806
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:25,354
by the religious person
of your choosing.

807
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,224
The second thing
that you have to do

808
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:31,528
is to have a series
of 10 Reiki sessions.

809
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,498
This is just to keep you
balanced, grounded.

810
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,633
Okay.

811
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:39,368
If she doesn't do anything,
what happens?

812
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,005
You'll probably die.

813
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,379
You guys have that
shocked look on your face.

814
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:53,917
Honestly, I'd rather it be me
than my little brother.

815
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:57,786
I knew something was wrong,
and I waited so long.

816
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,458
So if she does all this stuff,
this alien will be out of her?

817
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,461
Yes.

818
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:07,063
Holly, are you going
to sell this house?

819
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,265
- Yes.
- Okay.

820
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,934
It hurts, but yes.

821
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:14,470
The house is important,
but my kids are more important.

822
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,173
Well, the big question is,
Tila, are you going to do it?

823
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,608
I gotta.

824
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,345
I want a family some day,
and it's worth a life.

825
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,114
You know, I'm scared,
but I'm not going to let it win.

826
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,688
The only way this family
can remain safe

827
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,757
is to move as far away
as possible.

828
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,026
If they do that and contact
a religious leader

829
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,662
to perform an exorcism on Tila,

830
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,365
she and her family
can leave the aliens behind

831
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,834
and begin a peaceful life
someplace new.
