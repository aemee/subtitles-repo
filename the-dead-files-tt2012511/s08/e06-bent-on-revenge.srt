1
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,562
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam.

2
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,644
I felt hands push on my back.

3
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:16,127
And I just kept
flippin' down the stairs.

4
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,063
I think he's [bleep] with
people's heads really bad.

5
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,761
It was a deep, animalistic
growl, like...

6
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,430
It's just gonna happen
again and again and again.

7
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,766
I don't know if we are just crazy.

8
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,768
He's like, "You think you can stop me?

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,102
Because you can't."

10
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:35,739
He is bent on revenge.

11
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:39,184
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,320
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:43,322
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:44,344
They're from hell.

15
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,424
I see dead people.

16
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:46,692
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:48,460
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:50,362
They were setting people on fire,

19
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:51,497
burning them alive.

20
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,998
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,300
Her neck got broken.

22
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,769
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:58,771
I hear a gunshot.

24
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,339
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:01,974
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:04,155
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,354
Something's not right here.

28
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,724
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:09,892
It's not safe here.

30
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:10,993
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,545
Are any of them buried on the property?

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,696
They're all buried here.

33
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:16,165
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,201
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,602
Until the very end...

36
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,903
I can't do it no more.

37
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:22,939
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:24,289
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

39
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:25,739
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,223
It does not have a happy ending.

41
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:29,492
Something kills people here.

42
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:46,646
I'm in the small town of
Sicily Island, Louisiana.

43
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,009
It's about two hours
north of Baton Rouge.

44
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,965
I got a call from a woman
who sounded real bad,

45
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,138
and I mean terrible.

46
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,804
She says whatever's in her house

47
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,273
is goin' after her
children and her grandchild.

48
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,425
She told me, if we can't help her,

49
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:01,877
someone's gonna get hurt.

50
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:06,415
Before Amy arrives,

51
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:09,084
I clear the area of
any leading information,

52
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,486
covering anything that
might reveal to Amy

53
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:12,921
who lives in the house.

54
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,473
When I'm done,

55
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:16,258
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

56
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:31,740
There's a lot of men.

57
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:35,510
They're, like forming a big circle.

58
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:38,430
But they're, like,
very active over there.

59
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:41,083
I don't like it.

60
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:46,321
There are a lot of these men.

61
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:47,856
How many would you say?

62
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,541
I would say like 100.

63
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:55,230
They go all the way
around in the circle,

64
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:58,400
all the way around.

65
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,868
They're surrounding the place.

66
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:08,954
Well, when I
talked to you on the phone,

67
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,253
you sounded really upset.

68
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,189
I'm at wits' end.

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,224
We bought this place
a couple of years ago.

70
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,945
This is goin' to be our retirement home,

71
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,511
the dream home I always wanted.

72
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,563
Two or three months in, you know,

73
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,315
then, things started changing.

74
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,684
The family is at each other's throats.

75
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,453
My husband and I have
been together since 1987.

76
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,556
We've never argued, never had a fight.

77
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,558
We were always known
as the happy family.

78
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,145
Now I've had fantasies
that I want everybody gone.

79
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,262
It's gotten to the point where

80
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:39,778
we're on the verge of divorce

81
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,332
because we don't even
like to look at each other

82
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,148
without feeling some kind of resentment,

83
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,383
and we don't know why.

84
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:45,828
All right.

85
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,278
So who exactly lives
in the house with you?

86
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:51,132
We have my husband, Johnny, myself.

87
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,591
Then, we have Chelsea, who is 22.

88
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:55,690
Okay.

89
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:58,776
And then Jonathan, who is 26,

90
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,629
and then my youngest daughter, Brittany,

91
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:04,031
who's 19, and then the grandbaby,

92
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,850
who just turned a year old in February.

93
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:08,803
Give me a list of what
everybody's going through.

94
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:14,108
Footsteps, shadows,
apparitions, things moving.

95
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,445
It's starting to get violent.

96
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,780
Pat, it gets me concerned
when you say "violent."

97
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,998
What are we talkin' about?

98
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:22,833
I've had a daughter
pushed down the stairs.

99
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,836
I've had one pinned up against her wall.

100
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,655
Oh, geez.

101
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:30,124
What are you hoping we can do
for you now that we're here?

102
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:33,127
We trust you guys, and we're
really hoping and praying

103
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,062
that you can give us some answers,

104
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:37,398
help us find out what
we're dealing with.

105
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:43,070
But they definitely see them,

106
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,406
and they do see them like shadow people.

107
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,576
They can be physical and very direct.

108
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,113
They can completely
interact with the living,

109
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:53,781
and they can absolutely affect them.

110
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:58,319
This place is all about revenge.

111
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,688
Mm.

112
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,557
Different people want revenge.

113
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,209
What do they want to do?

114
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:11,098
They would like to
murder and torture people.

115
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,637
Okay. So what's going on in here?

116
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:19,106
It's a lot of activity
that goes on in here.

117
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,375
So I haven't slept in a year and a half.

118
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,810
Okay, so what are we talkin' about?

119
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,045
What kind of activity?

120
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,547
- I've heard some growling.
- What did it sound like?

121
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:30,084
It was a deep, throaty,
animalistic growl, like...

122
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:33,921
What about animals, stray animals,

123
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:36,440
do a growling noise like that?

124
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:39,036
No, no. There is no stray
animals that run around.

125
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,686
And then, I've seen shadow people

126
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,904
in the corner of the room.

127
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,290
Okay. Describe 'em to me.

128
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,192
It's a group of five or six,

129
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,110
I would say, just standing there.

130
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:49,762
I mean, you got a big window here.

131
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,430
Could it possibly be
people from outside?

132
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:52,648
I don't see how.

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,350
Not at night.

134
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,485
I don't see how.

135
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:11,166
Oh, I just saw this huge [bleep] thing.

136
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:13,402
He, like, bent down,
and then, he stood up.

137
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,737
And he was, like, enormous.

138
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,205
How tall would you say?

139
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,191
As tall as the ceiling.

140
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,545
Is he related to the ones outside?

141
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:25,281
Yes. He just He comes in.

142
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,150
Then, he's just stare...
you know, standing there.

143
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,152
Do you think people have seen him?

144
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:31,320
Yes.

145
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:34,023
It was a vision from
the person in the bed.

146
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:46,368
I was talking to your wife, Pat,

147
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,603
and she's pretty upset.

148
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,271
She thinks that
whatever's happening here

149
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,606
is tearing the family apart.

150
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,224
I believe so, yeah.

151
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:53,576
She said to me, you know,

152
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,394
she fantasizes about
being alone in the house.

153
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,528
Right.

154
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:58,397
I mean, does that sound like Pat to you?

155
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,849
Ordinarily, no. Since
we've been here, yes.

156
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:04,453
I get the feeling that she
would be okay with me leavin'.

157
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,338
So you think she's allowing the house

158
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:07,856
to come between you guys?

159
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,158
Yep. She's obsessed with it.

160
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,677
To me, there's nothin'
more important than family.

161
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,512
I mean, I could care
less about this house.

162
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:14,730
Now, what about yourself?

163
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,565
Have you ever experienced
anything in the house?

164
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah.

165
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,703
I've seen the silhouette of a man

166
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,504
at the top of the stairs.

167
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,841
It was, uh, a dark figure.

168
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:27,643
And it looked like he had a beard.

169
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:29,144
Okay. Anything else?

170
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,313
I've heard things
fall, uh, or...

171
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,982
or being thrown,

172
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,718
like maybe somebody
dropped a book on carpet.

173
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,586
How often are you hearing these sounds?

174
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:39,355
I've just heard 'em a few times,

175
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,191
but everyone else tells me
they hear 'em all the time.

176
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:43,993
What do you think's in this house?

177
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:46,045
I haven't got an idea, but if it's evil,

178
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,863
then it's got to be some
kind of demonic figure.

179
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:52,201
If it's somethin' bad,
I'm... I'm not gonna stay.

180
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:56,338
I just saw another shadow
person in the hallway.

181
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,341
It was right here.

182
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,944
And then, it crawled up
the back of the stairs.

183
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,379
And then, it popped through this stair.

184
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:06,131
But it makes a lot of
noise, a lot of ruckus.

185
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,584
It would be, like, a lot
of crashing and banging.

186
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,085
And I think they might hear, like,

187
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:11,320
the grunting and the growling.

188
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:16,025
It was angry that we
came into its space.

189
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,601
When I was talkin' to
your mom, she mentioned that

190
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,185
her and your dad were
talking about divorce.

191
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,085
That started about a month or two

192
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:45,887
after we moved into this house.

193
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:49,290
Honestly, I don't like it.

194
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,659
I feel like the house is
just tearing us all apart.

195
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:54,412
All right, now, she's
concerned about your son.

196
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,642
Think she has a reason to be concerned?

197
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:57,707
I do.

198
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,275
And why do you say that?

199
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:02,245
Um, I was about six to
seven months pregnant,

200
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,180
and I was comin' out of the bathroom.

201
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,283
And I felt hands push on my back.

202
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:09,686
And I just kept
flippin' down the stairs.

203
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,590
I mean, that's some
friggin' fall you took.

204
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,625
So how bad you get hurt?

205
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,876
Scrapes and bruises.

206
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,228
They did suspect

207
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,163
that I was going into premature labor.

208
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,098
But they were able to slow it down.

209
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:23,233
Okay.

210
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,101
- You got lucky on that one.
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,303
Seen people fall less than that

212
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,506
and break their neck and died.

213
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,007
I feel like something was

214
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:33,076
intentionally trying
to make me lose my son.

215
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:41,317
I'm seeing this... old man.

216
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,586
He's pissed.

217
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:45,738
There's a lot of anger here,

218
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:48,191
a lot of tension...

219
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:53,930
'Cause he is bent on revenge.

220
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,503
So a woman died up here.

221
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:02,972
Way in her death state.

222
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:04,707
She's puking.

223
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,142
She's really sick.

224
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,378
Now I'm feeling pain.

225
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,046
Ugh.

226
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:12,615
It literally feels like
I'm being stabbed to death.

227
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,317
The old man's like, "Oh. Ha-ha.

228
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,253
You think you can stop me?
You think you can stop me?

229
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,922
Because you can't."

230
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,257
He's like, "And it's
just gonna happen again

231
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,160
and again and again and again."

232
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,495
What is?

233
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,397
Women gettin' killed.

234
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:37,674
Seems like everybody in the
house is having experiences.

235
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,409
What about you?

236
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,793
I would wake up sometimes

237
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:43,213
to feel like someone's
hand was on my neck.

238
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,949
Kind of just woke me up
like I was gasping for air.

239
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,800
How many times has this happened to you?

240
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:51,721
It has happened at least a dozen times.

241
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:55,225
Okay. So has anything else happened?

242
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,610
Three times, on separate occasions

243
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:01,281
since I've lived here in the
two years, I would wake up,

244
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,699
and there'd be open razor blades

245
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:03,967
sitting where I was sleeping.

246
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:05,134
I mean, are you [bleep] with me?

247
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,404
Or are you tellin' me
the truth about this?

248
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:07,427
I'm tellin' you the truth.

249
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,742
So basically, what you're tellin' me is

250
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,194
every night you go
to bed, you don't know

251
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,324
if you're gonna get choked,
woken up by razor blades?

252
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,352
Do you have any idea
how [bleep] this sounds?

253
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,518
Yeah.

254
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,687
I don't know if it's the house

255
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:21,823
or if we are just crazy.

256
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,863
I don't really
like it in here, either.

257
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:30,899
This dead guy is the
main [bleep] problem.

258
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:33,268
I think he can cause hallucinations.

259
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:37,873
I think he can [bleep]
people's heads really bad.

260
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:41,409
He can cause physical
pain, um, to the living.

261
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,445
He's very creepy.

262
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,448
He can cause, like, stabbing pain,

263
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,253
cutting pain, burning
pain, um, choking pain,

264
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:53,455
um, things like that.

265
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:01,931
I was talkin' to mom

266
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:03,664
about some of the bizarre
stuff goin' on here.

267
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,049
Now, she thinks that whatever's here

268
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,934
is tearing the family apart.
Do you agree with that?

269
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,870
We used to be a pretty
close, tight-knit family.

270
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:13,440
We just kind of barely can
stand the sight of each other.

271
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,860
As far as your experiences,
you've had some, I understand.

272
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,161
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

273
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,879
Why don't you tell me about one of 'em?

274
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:23,684
I woke up one night, um,
in a really odd position.

275
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,487
I was, uh, up my wall.

276
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,923
And my feet were kind of dangling.

277
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,658
So you're basically
pinned on the ceiling?

278
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:31,792
Mm-hmm.

279
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,494
That's something out of a movie.

280
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:35,996
You sure you didn't dream that?

281
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,064
I'm positive.

282
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,049
I fell down onto the bed.

283
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,152
All right. What else has happened?

284
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,670
I was actually having, um,

285
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,573
a pretty strange nightmare,
which is what woke me up.

286
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:49,226
I was being pinned down by a woman.

287
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:52,613
Um, and she had her hands
over my mouth and my nose.

288
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,565
So, Chelsea, if you saw this woman again

289
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,054
in a sketch or a photo
or somethin' like that,

290
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,353
would you recognize her?

291
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,755
Actually, a year after I had the dream

292
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:02,591
that my mom was doin'
some research on the house

293
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,261
and came across a photo
of Nettie Fairbanks.

294
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,362
Okay.

295
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,830
And, um...

296
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,383
it was the woman from my nightmares.

297
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,301
- This person lived here?
- Yes.

298
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:18,107
A lot of the old man's anger, like,

299
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:22,044
just fills every nook
and cranny in here.

300
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:26,916
He just comes in, and it's
like just all this rage.

301
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:29,985
I think that there's a living person.

302
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,438
Um, he's, like, stomping her down.

303
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:36,258
Like, he's stomping her down.

304
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:38,878
And because of the
hallucinations and stuff,

305
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:42,798
I don't think there's a
lot of sleep to be had.

306
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:46,035
He gets in there, and he's,
like, pullin' stuff out,

307
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:49,138
like, nasty [bleep].

308
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,160
And, like, making these weird
hallucinations around it.

309
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,580
He does not want them here.

310
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,317
And I think that he

311
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:07,523
is trying to figure out how exactly

312
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,494
to get rid of them.

313
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,364
He's a mean [bleep].

314
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,938
Chelsea thinks that some woman

315
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:36,771
named Nettie Fairbanks
is haunting her house.

316
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:39,307
Now, when clients do their own research,

317
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,642
I take it with a grain of salt,

318
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,111
but I reached out to a
state historian who says

319
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:45,197
that woman really did live in the house

320
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,233
and that her time there was
filled with nothing but tragedy.

321
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,223
So, Charlotte,

322
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,058
it's true that Nettie Fairbanks lived in

323
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,543
my clients' property and in the house.

324
00:14:58,662 --> 00:14:59,712
Yes, that's true.

325
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:00,978
Okay. So what do we know about her?

326
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:02,952
Well, in 1892,

327
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,421
Henry Fairbanks actually
bought the property.

328
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,874
He fell in love with Henrietta Blackman,

329
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,559
who he called Nettie.

330
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,794
And I have a photo of her for you.

331
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,796
Okay, so this is good news

332
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,517
because my client said
she saw this woman.

333
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,969
Now, did she and Henry have any kids?

334
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,455
Yes. They have three children.

335
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,274
Two boys, Russell and Thomas,

336
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,309
and a little girl named Henrietta.

337
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,178
Now, Charlotte, you
mentioned on the phone

338
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,880
that this woman in the
family had a life of tragedy.

339
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,248
What'd you mean?

340
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,468
Well, in 1899, the night
that Henrietta was born,

341
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:37,136
Henry had a terrible accident.

342
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,289
- Okay.
- He was out celebrating.

343
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,524
And he decided to
ride home on his horse.

344
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,910
He was stinking, fall-down drunk.

345
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,529
And he fell in a water-filled ditch.

346
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:48,270
This would seem harmless,

347
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,903
but he actually caught pneumonia

348
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,671
from the dirty water he fell into,

349
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,206
and he died three days later.

350
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,075
Oh, you're kiddin' me.

351
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,926
The following year, in 1900,
her baby boy, Thomas, dies.

352
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,860
He was three years old at the time.

353
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,394
Okay. Do we know how Thomas died?

354
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,580
There are no details how he died.

355
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,782
Okay, so, now her husband's
dead, her kid's dead.

356
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:08,300
Does she stay on the property?

357
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,752
She did stay after that.

358
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,054
In 1901, she actually marries again.

359
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,557
This time, she marries
a traveling dentist,

360
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,526
Dr. Henry Joseph Disch.

361
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:18,928
And that is his photo.

362
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,163
I mean, do things go well?
She live happily ever after?

363
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,498
What happens?

364
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,200
Actually, no. As it turns out,

365
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:26,902
Nettie's daughter was
born with epilepsy.

366
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:29,038
Here's a photo of Henrietta.

367
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:32,174
She suffered from severe seizures.

368
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:33,809
She became difficult to handle.

369
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,178
So when she was 22 years
old, she was sent away

370
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,915
to the Louisiana State
Hospital for the Insane.

371
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:45,070
In 1922, at the age of 23,
Henrietta dies in the hospital.

372
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:49,325
According to her death
record, she died of epilepsy.

373
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,294
Okay.

374
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,797
Nettie remains on the
property another 10 years.

375
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,965
Okay.

376
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,133
She becomes weak and
suffers from an illness

377
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:01,804
that eventually leads
to a cerebral hemorrhage.

378
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,806
Here's her death certificate.

379
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,974
Okay.

380
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,610
She dies in 1932 at the age of 58.

381
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,079
Does she die on the property?

382
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,214
She actually dies at her son's home.

383
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,016
But according to descendants,

384
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,886
her body was brought back
to her home for the wake.

385
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:19,488
Okay. That's interesting.

386
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,159
Some of these... Like, there
was a lot of death here.

387
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,161
There were, like, three or four deaths.

388
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,231
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam.

389
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,502
But they had, like,
some kind of private,

390
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:37,306
like, uh, ceremonies here or something.

391
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,293
It's all in embarrassment.

392
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:44,647
They're talking about
this sister in particular.

393
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:47,066
And everybody's, like,
talking like this.

394
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:50,219
"Uh, we have to do something
because it's just awful.

395
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,254
It's just too embarrassing."

396
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,590
Yeah. I don't even know
who's dead because, honestly,

397
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,192
it's like, they're just, like,
literally shoved in a corner.

398
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,228
So you can't see the actual body?

399
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,646
No.

400
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:03,032
I want to say it's a male and a female.

401
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:06,502
I think the male is the old man
causing all the problems here.

402
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,470
Ah.

403
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:10,656
All right.

404
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,458
So who's on the property at this point?

405
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:14,877
After Nettie, her
son, Russell Fairbanks,

406
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,262
moved onto the property.

407
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,397
This is a photo of Russell.

408
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,099
Okay. What's his story?

409
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,368
Well, actually, he was a
well-known, prominent man

410
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:23,586
in the community.

411
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,688
He had followed in his
stepfather's footsteps

412
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,022
and become a dentist.

413
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:30,359
Well, in 1971, Russell
suffers his own tragic death.

414
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,494
He decides to take a fishing trip

415
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,164
one mile from his
home, on Lake Lovelace.

416
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,832
Okay. So what happens at the lake?

417
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,167
Well, no one knows why,

418
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,803
but for some reason, he fell overboard.

419
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:42,104
He drowned.

420
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:45,691
Here's a newspaper article.
He was 75 at the time.

421
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,610
He was a rugged man's man.

422
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:51,680
And there's really no indication
of why he fell overboard.

423
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,182
It's a mystery.

424
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,317
That's interesting.

425
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,854
This guy
causing all the problems,

426
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,856
do you know how old he was when he died?

427
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,758
Late 60s, early 70s.

428
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,926
He lived here then, you think?

429
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:06,328
I believe he did.

430
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:09,198
Like, I think he died with
his shirt off or something.

431
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,533
Like, he walks around without a shirt.

432
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:12,868
He had a lot of money.

433
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,220
And I think people
really [bleep] respected

434
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:18,157
the [bleep] out of him.

435
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,029
He's just, like, raving.

436
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:27,483
Like, he's like a [bleep]
lunatic about this woman.

437
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,652
"[Bleep] hate her,
and she's gonna eat it.

438
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:31,453
She's gonna [bleep] eat it."

439
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,876
If you need us to investigate

440
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,562
unexplained activity in your home,

441
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,263
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

442
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,563
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

443
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:46,964
and we'll help if we can.

444
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,690
So far, I've got
a family being torn apart

445
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,705
by unexplained activity on a property

446
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:04,356
that's seen one tragic
death after another.

447
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,325
But I want to see if
there's anything else

448
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,610
that might help my investigation.

449
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,079
Searching through old records,

450
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,271
I find a man named William Ditto.

451
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,704
Turns out he used to run a plantation

452
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,556
right on my clients' property.

453
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:19,960
So I've asked a local
genealogist to meet me here.

454
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,028
He says William Ditto got destroyed

455
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:24,364
defending the Confederate cause.

456
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:29,669
In the 1860s,

457
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,473
William Lego Ditto owned
your clients' property.

458
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,877
He was a lawyer and a slave owner.

459
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:39,045
This guy was pretty
wealthy, I would assume.

460
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:41,248
He was a very, very wealthy man.

461
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,201
He was worth $120,000 at that time,

462
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,052
which was a lot of money.

463
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,921
How many slaves did Ditto have?

464
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:52,025
According to the 1860
census, he had 72 slaves.

465
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,493
Okay. So that's a lot, right?

466
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,329
That's a lot of slaves, yes.

467
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:58,982
Slaves had very few rights.

468
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,319
It was illegal to teach your
slaves to read and write.

469
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,238
A slave owner could beat 'em.

470
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,540
Ohh.

471
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,625
That's pretty brutal.

472
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:11,011
Even for a homicide detective,
this makes me squeamish

473
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,779
just lookin' at this.

474
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,397
Would I assume correctly that slaves

475
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,149
would have been buried on the property?

476
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,836
Yes, 'cause in this country
We're so warm and all...

477
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:22,158
you had to bury a person quickly.

478
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:24,775
Okay. Now, this guy, Ditto,

479
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,166
you mentioned that he
was a staunch Confederate.

480
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:31,451
Yes, he helped form a cavalry unit.

481
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:34,037
He went and fought, I
believe it was in Kentucky.

482
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,778
- Okay.
- And he was captured.

483
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,428
He was prisoner of war for
about a year and a half.

484
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:40,912
He was released from that the same day

485
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,665
that Lee signed the treaty
for the end of the war.

486
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,350
Okay. So this guy was a POW.

487
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:47,518
- Right.
- What happens?

488
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:50,688
He comes home. All the slaves are gone.

489
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:52,590
If he had Confederate
money, it was worth nothing.

490
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:55,553
All he had was the value of the land.

491
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,286
So this guy basically went
off to fight in the war,

492
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:58,620
came home, he lost everything.

493
00:21:58,706 --> 00:21:59,755
He lost everything.

494
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,290
He ended up

495
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,942
having to sell your
clients' property in 1868.

496
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,444
Okay.

497
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,229
And he moves to Florida.

498
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:09,598
Not surprised to find that
there was slaves on the property,

499
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,049
but my clients had no idea.

500
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:14,542
Those slaves were not the
only slaves in Sicily Island.

501
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:18,477
The Native Americans there
had slaves and were slaves.

502
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:20,145
And you might want to look into that.

503
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,514
Okay. Interesting.

504
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,923
I'm trying to understand
who these shadow men are.

505
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:34,159
I think they were human before.

506
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,662
Do you have any idea when this was?

507
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:41,666
I get, like, a 1798

508
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,100
and then an 1843.

509
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,033
Okay.

510
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:49,570
I'm definitely hearing
about bad, bad deaths.

511
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:54,408
I think they're all buried nearby.

512
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,211
And they're just bent on revenge.

513
00:22:57,313 --> 00:23:00,047
Do you have any idea what
they want revenge for?

514
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:02,649
How they were treated, like animals.

515
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,235
They had to walk a lot.

516
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,355
Their feet were bloody.

517
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:10,407
And I do see chains.

518
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:15,529
They don't want to go anywhere
because they want their revenge.

519
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,335
You know, I
placed a couple calls,

520
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,870
and Dave's lead checked out.

521
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,688
The Native Americans in Sicily Island

522
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:26,056
were sold off into slavery.

523
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,492
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

524
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,377
who wants to show me the exact spot

525
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:31,979
where the Natchez tribe was wiped out.

526
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:40,120
We're really close to the
spot where the Natchez Indians

527
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,723
made their last stand against the French

528
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,391
in early 1731.

529
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,827
So I know we're only a couple of
miles from my clients' property,

530
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,345
so this is important then.

531
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,930
So what can you tell me about the tribe?

532
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,665
To give you an idea of
what they looked like,

533
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,001
this is a modern representation.

534
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:57,521
So I know you mentioned
that they were wiped out.

535
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,555
How'd that all happen?

536
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:01,074
In January of 1731,

537
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,711
the French brought in
cannons, brought in mortars.

538
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,180
And after pounding the place

539
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:09,283
with things like...

540
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:10,851
this...

541
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:15,556
the vast majority of them are
taken prisoner by the French.

542
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:18,529
They're taken down the
Mississippi to New Orleans

543
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,163
and shipped off to Santo Domingo

544
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:21,479
and probably end up

545
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,381
being worked to death in
sugar cane fields there.

546
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:24,766
So that's it.
There's no more...

547
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:26,301
There's no Natchez Nation after that.

548
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,603
Okay.

549
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:37,512
I saw dozens of dead
people during my walk.

550
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:40,114
But two have me the most concerned.

551
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:43,084
First, the leader of the shadow men.

552
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:46,120
I was in a bedroom. There
was a person in the bed.

553
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:55,396
And there was this huge figure
coming in from the other room.

554
00:24:55,532 --> 00:25:00,902
Next, I describe the old
man terrorizing the living.

555
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:03,438
He's white.

556
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,374
He had jowls, kind of wrinkled.

557
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:10,878
And he had deep-set eyes,

558
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,981
like, kind of grumpy-looking.

559
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,787
Is this who you saw?

560
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:23,458
Yes.

561
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:46,818
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

562
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

563
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:52,524
and our clients for the first time.

564
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,176
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet Pat.

565
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:56,628
And this is her husband, Johnny.

566
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,931
Now, they bought this
fixer-upper about two years ago.

567
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,033
They hoped to turn it into
their dream retirement home,

568
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,268
and it's been anything but.

569
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,370
Chelsea is one of their three

570
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,172
grown children that live here.

571
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,674
I got a photo of the other kids.

572
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,512
This is Jonathan, and this is
Brittany, who also has a baby.

573
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:14,846
Now, everyone here agrees

574
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:17,065
there's something weird
going on, and I mean weird.

575
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:19,117
But Pat doesn't want to leave.

576
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:20,519
On the other hand,

577
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,087
if Johnny doesn't like
what he hears tonight,

578
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,189
he's ready to pack up and leave.

579
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:30,197
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's goin' on,

580
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,648
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

581
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:40,823
One of the most disturbing
things that I encountered

582
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,191
was actually outside.

583
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:44,827
I saw about 100 shadow men.

584
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:47,363
They were surrounding the house.

585
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,398
Wow.

586
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,466
These shadow people

587
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:52,852
are extremely solid, and I felt like

588
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:55,371
they could affect and
influence people in the area.

589
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:57,974
And I do feel like

590
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,778
they're capable of physical
contact with the living.

591
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,913
Well, pretty much

592
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,581
everybody in the house
has seen shadow figures.

593
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:06,949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

594
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:08,384
I've seen it twice.

595
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:11,587
In the corner of my bedroom,

596
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,189
they were all standing
shoulder to shoulder,

597
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,591
some in the backs, tall,
short, varying heights.

598
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:18,528
I call them watchers.

599
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,229
That's what they
were doing...

600
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:22,331
just standing there,
observing and watching.

601
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,867
Well, when I was in the master bedroom,

602
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:29,305
I was seeing a situation
that took place,

603
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:31,357
but I was seeing it through the eyes

604
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:33,609
of the person who was laying in the bed.

605
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,745
He, like, bent down,
and then, he stood up,

606
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,413
and he was, like, enormous.

607
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:38,848
How tall would you say?

608
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,285
As tall as the ceiling.

609
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:45,088
I did do a sketch.

610
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:53,729
Oh, geez.

611
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:55,331
Take a look at that.

612
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:01,838
This is what I see.

613
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,239
It's definitely unnerving.

614
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,910
I don't need anybody watchin' me sleep.

615
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:11,125
These shadow
things, what are they?

616
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:13,063
Were they ever alive? What's the story?

617
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:16,114
Yes, they were all
alive at one point in time.

618
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,950
What I believe is that these people

619
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,686
are from several different time periods.

620
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:27,525
I did see men being beaten,
being treated like animals.

621
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:31,663
A group of them had
walked a long distance.

622
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,200
And their feet were bleeding.

623
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,402
I saw some that were
chained and starving.

624
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:39,437
I saw some dying.

625
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:43,274
The one consistent element
with all of these men,

626
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:46,728
mainly, um, is revenge.

627
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:50,415
They want revenge for how they all died.

628
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:52,484
Wow.

629
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,156
I think a large percentage
of them are buried nearby.

630
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,290
Hmm.

631
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:01,125
And I got two
specific dates...

632
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:04,262
1798 and 1843.

633
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:07,165
Now, we're in the Deep
South, so it's no surprise

634
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,250
that this place used to be
a plantation at one time.

635
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:10,869
Now, back in 1860,

636
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:14,873
your property was owned by a
guy named William Lego Ditto.

637
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,975
Actually got a photo of him.

638
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:18,409
Oh.

639
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,949
That reminds me of the
silhouette that I saw.

640
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,119
Couldn't make out any
real detail like this.

641
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:31,356
But now that I see the picture
with the beard, the shape,

642
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,125
it's a lot like what I was seein'.

643
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,393
Interesting.

644
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:37,862
He owned 72 slaves who worked the land.

645
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:39,464
Now, we all know

646
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,966
the conditions of slaves
and how inhumane it was.

647
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,801
This is a picture.

648
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,603
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

649
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:49,407
This is as it healed.

650
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,112
The expert I talked to
said, more than likely,

651
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,948
you have a lot of buried slaves here

652
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,516
in unmarked graves.

653
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:00,952
Now, this guy, Ditto,
was a staunch Confederate.

654
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:02,387
And he actually formed

655
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,789
his own regiment right here
and went off to fight the war.

656
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:07,559
Now, he wound up becomin' a POW.

657
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:09,944
Came back here to nothing.

658
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,996
Slaves were gone. Place was in ruins.

659
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:14,966
Not only did he lose the
war, he lost everything.

660
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,335
Now, here's the other surprising thing

661
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,003
that I came up with during the research.

662
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:21,339
There's another group of people
that lived on the land also

663
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:22,910
that became slaves.

664
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,926
This area was once occupied,

665
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:27,295
in the 1700s, by the Native Americans.

666
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,448
They're called the Natchez tribe.

667
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,785
I got an artist's rendition of
what they might've looked like.

668
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:37,255
In 1731, they got
wiped out by the French.

669
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,107
Now, most of the tribe's
people were killed.

670
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,927
- But 200 were taken prisoner.
- Mm.

671
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:44,763
They were put in chains
and walked to New Orleans.

672
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:45,897
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,633
Where they were basically
sold into slavery.

674
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:50,635
And they were sent to
the Dominican Republic,

675
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:52,337
where they worked in sugar canes.

676
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,072
The tribe was annihilated.

677
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:57,742
You think these shadow people may be

678
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,878
the slaves and the
Indians gettin' together?

679
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,012
Yeah. Totally makes sense.

680
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,785
- Inhumane.
- It is.

681
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:05,984
No excuse.

682
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,370
And I don't blame 'em
for wanting revenge.

683
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:11,540
We're desecrating their resting place.

684
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:15,761
So what else did you see?

685
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,364
I went to the back
room behind the stairs.

686
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,302
And I heard someone say
there was a lot of death here.

687
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,937
And then, I got bam, bam, bam.

688
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:26,972
And I heard three to four deaths.

689
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:30,659
And then, I was seeing wakes
or funerals taking place.

690
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:33,412
I heard people talking in hushed tones.

691
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:36,582
I actually did overhear someone
talking about how embarrassing,

692
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:38,116
uh, about the sister

693
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:41,219
and that she was kind of
messed up or something.

694
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,855
And I was seeing two
bodies in the corner.

695
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,524
One was male, and one was female.

696
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:46,825
The male was elderly.

697
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:49,912
And then, when I walked up the stairs,

698
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,732
I ran into a woman who
was in her death state.

699
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:57,836
And it was an extremely painful death.

700
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:01,340
She wasn't able to catch her breath.

701
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:04,176
And I suddenly felt like I
was being stabbed to death

702
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:08,280
all through my stomach area.

703
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,217
You okay, honey?

704
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:16,154
Just started a few days ago

705
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:17,789
where I couldn't catch my breath.

706
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:21,059
And there was this... this
sharp pain in my chest.

707
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:23,061
And I've had that stabbing pain

708
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:27,582
in my side and my
stomach for months now.

709
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:32,938
I'm assuming that's what
she's feeling, Amy, or...

710
00:32:33,073 --> 00:32:34,756
More than likely, yeah.

711
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:37,409
This is what we know for sure.

712
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:39,878
There was a woman whose wake
was held here in the house.

713
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:42,280
She did die a very painful death.

714
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,516
Her name was Nettie Fairbanks.

715
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,119
And she moved into the house in 1894,

716
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:48,787
when it was first built.

717
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:50,622
I actually have a photograph of her.

718
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,592
This is Nettie.

719
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:56,428
Her time here was pretty miserable.

720
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,330
In 1899, her husband got drunk,

721
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:01,233
fell off his horse into some water,

722
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:03,635
and wound up gettin' pneumonia
and died three days later.

723
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:04,936
Mm.

724
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,206
In 1900, her
three-year-old son died.

725
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:10,892
We don't know what the causes are.

726
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:13,362
She gets remarried to
this traveling dentist.

727
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:16,581
Now, I tracked down a family portrait.

728
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:21,219
This is her daughter, Henrietta.

729
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:22,721
You mentioned somethin' about

730
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,556
an embarrassment or something like that.

731
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:25,640
Whoa, yeah.

732
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,593
Okay. Now, Henrietta had epilepsy.

733
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,495
Her family couldn't handle it.

734
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,030
So she was sent to an insane asylum.

735
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,398
Oh, wow.

736
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,234
Henrietta spent less than
a year in that insane asylum

737
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,286
before she died at the age of 23.

738
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:42,290
Nettie's second husband
died a couple years later...

739
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,743
- Geez.
- 1924.

740
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:48,013
Now, Nettie stayed in the
house for about 10 years

741
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:49,681
before getting very sick.

742
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:52,150
In 1932, she died of
a cerebral hemorrhage.

743
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:54,516
And her wake was actually
held right here, in the house.

744
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,416
Wow.

745
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:58,752
Chelsea, you think
she's haunting the house.

746
00:33:58,837 --> 00:33:59,953
Yeah.

747
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:02,756
I've seen her this
clearly in nightmares.

748
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,561
She pins me down and puts her
hands over my mouth and my nose.

749
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,135
Interesting.

750
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:11,403
So the person

751
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,055
that I'm most concerned about

752
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:17,409
is a nasty old man that I encountered.

753
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:21,580
He's very manipulative, very bad.

754
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:23,102
And he was laughing
at me, and he was like,

755
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:24,752
"You think you can stop me?

756
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,671
No way. "You're not gonna."

757
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:30,207
He really likes the room
upstairs to the left.

758
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,576
That's Chelsea's room, just so you know.

759
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,111
Oh.

760
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:39,800
This guy, comin' into that
room, he was stompin'...

761
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,071
boom, boom, boom... and
just pushing the rage.

762
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,893
I mean, it's overwhelming.

763
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:49,427
I saw that he was, like,

764
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,396
stomping down on a living woman,

765
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:55,733
um, like, trying to repress her.

766
00:34:56,903 --> 00:35:01,139
And I got that she
wasn't getting any sleep.

767
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:04,108
Also making people
paranoid of one another

768
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:06,461
and causing fights.

769
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:09,130
What he does is he'll
reach into people's minds,

770
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:10,582
and he'll dig out the nastiest stuff,

771
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:13,885
like, the worst issues,
and pop those up.

772
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,638
He can cause serious physical harm.

773
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,140
I feel that he is capable of that.

774
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,227
Sensations that I was getting

775
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:25,230
was stabbing, cutting,
burning, and choking pains.

776
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,533
Well, pretty much listed

777
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,902
every single thing these
guys are experiencing.

778
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,239
I was having a nightmare,
actually of... about Nettie.

779
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,375
And she was pinning me down.

780
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:39,377
And I woke up to this
pressure on my chest.

781
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,979
And I was all the way up my wall.

782
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:43,915
My head was touching the
rafters of my ceiling.

783
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,267
Now, your sister,

784
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:48,086
when she was six months pregnant,

785
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,420
got pushed down the steps.

786
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,322
Yeah.

787
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,624
That could be him.

788
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,828
Now, her brother sleeps upstairs, too,

789
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,529
and he has a lot of trouble

790
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:00,315
feeling like he's being choked.

791
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:01,766
Mm-hmm. The smothering.

792
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:03,434
- Yep.
- Yeah.

793
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,153
Now, Jonathan, when I interviewed him,

794
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:07,005
told me a story that
I still don't believe,

795
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,339
to be honest with you.

796
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:12,610
He'd wake up with
razor blades in his bed.

797
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:16,381
And I thought he was messin' with me.

798
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,917
But maybe it's this guy
making him hallucinate.

799
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,836
Now, you also said this
guy can make people fight.

800
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,688
Whoa, yeah.

801
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,241
The anger is just at...
just can just tip over

802
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,743
at any slight, little
thing, and we explode.

803
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:31,246
We never acted like this before.

804
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,747
It's got to be in this house.

805
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:35,800
This house is gonna tear us apart.

806
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:42,373
You got any idea who this
[bleep] was when he was alive?

807
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,175
I got that he lived here,

808
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,544
that he had a lot of money and power,

809
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,230
that people really respected
him when he was alive.

810
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:54,485
He was white, in his late
60s or early 70s when he died.

811
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,222
What I saw when he
was crawling towards me

812
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:01,192
was that he had his shirt off.

813
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:03,945
And I think that's how he died.

814
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:06,564
All right, so this is
a... It may be a long shot,

815
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,116
but Nettie had a son named Russell.

816
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:10,518
Now, after Nettie died in 1932,

817
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,887
he took over this house
with his wife and six kids.

818
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:15,089
Now, this guy was a prominent guy.

819
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,092
He was a World War I
vet. He was a dentist.

820
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,594
He was involved in politics.

821
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:22,430
- Okay.
- What really caught my attention

822
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:24,449
is when you said he
died with his shirt off.

823
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:25,750
- Yes.
- Okay.

824
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:28,553
Now, in 1971, Russell drowned

825
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,306
in Lake Lovelace, which is
less than a mile from here.

826
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:32,623
Oh.

827
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:35,760
He was 75 years old according
to this article here.

828
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,562
So I was able to get
a photo of this guy.

829
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,498
The only thing is it
was when he was young.

830
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,023
So, you had seen him as an older man.

831
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:44,422
I don't know if...

832
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:47,151
This is what he looked like
when he was in his younger days.

833
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,417
Now, is it possible this
could be the guy you saw?

834
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,620
I had a sketch done of him.

835
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,788
Tell me what you think.

836
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:03,698
Take a look at who's
terrorizing your family.

837
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:09,604
This one was the one
I feel like I've seen.

838
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,274
They have a lot of similarities.

839
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,582
So you guys are thinking

840
00:38:20,684 --> 00:38:22,751
you might have ran into this guy, Ditto.

841
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:23,921
No beard, though.

842
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,228
Yeah. I think it's him.

843
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:28,364
- What do you think of these?
- You know what?

844
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,900
The more I look at the photo,
if you put a beard on him...

845
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,234
They look a lot...

846
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,403
- ...it's really close.
- Very, very close.

847
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:38,040
He was a lawyer, well-respected.

848
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:40,409
So, Chelsea, now you
know who's in your room.

849
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:45,381
I'm terrified, actually.

850
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:50,219
All right. So those
shadow people outside,

851
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:51,871
you think they're his former slaves?

852
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,188
Yeah, I'm thinkin'.

853
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,558
I also think some of
those people out there

854
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:58,060
are the Native Americans.

855
00:38:58,145 --> 00:39:00,296
Is this guy responsible
for all their infighting,

856
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:01,797
their animosity towards each other?

857
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,066
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

858
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,068
I think he's the master manipulator.

859
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,938
He's the one causing hallucinations,

860
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,206
causing people to fight.

861
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,409
I think he's the major problem.

862
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:17,162
There's got to be some
way I can reach into his...

863
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,081
his world and take care of him.

864
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:38,078
Well, guys, there's
some good news here.

865
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,045
All the fighting, talk
of divorce, it's not you.

866
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,915
Chelsea, all the stuff
you been going through

867
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:46,918
upstairs in your bedroom,
you're not goin' nuts.

868
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,820
Now it's time to answer the
question you brought us in for.

869
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:51,222
Can you live here safely, happily

870
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:53,691
with your family like
you always intended to do?

871
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,993
Well, for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

872
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:04,285
The first order of business
is to remove this guy.

873
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,227
What I would like to see happen is

874
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:10,263
a black, male medium

875
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,467
needs to come in and remove him.

876
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,001
And this will be by force.

877
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:17,504
This isn't gonna be
a pleasant experience,

878
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,840
probably for either one, really.

879
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,642
This would then be followed by

880
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:28,899
that same medium working with
the dead slaves to move them on.

881
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:33,186
I think that once he's
gotten rid of this jerk,

882
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:38,425
most, if not all, of the
dead that are still here

883
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:41,061
will move on themselves.

884
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,332
Then, once all of that's done,

885
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:49,836
a Native American
medicine man needs to come.

886
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:53,540
And what needs to be done
then is all of you guys

887
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:57,043
need to do a peace offering ritual.

888
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:01,148
This is to let the Native Americans know

889
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,467
that you mean them no harm.

890
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:06,636
Once that's done, they're
going to back off of you.

891
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:10,140
Okay, so if they do everything you say,

892
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:12,125
and one year from now,
we walk back in here,

893
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,543
you think they'll be better?

894
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:16,496
- Yeah. It'll be great.
- Good. Good. Yeah.

895
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:20,467
Well, I'm relieved that I don't
have to leave my dream home.

896
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,537
You saved more than a house.

897
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,021
You saved a family.

898
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,140
Yeah.

899
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:28,792
I'm ready to start fightin' it.

900
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,393
Yeah. He's not gonna win.

901
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:33,380
There's no way, no way. Unh-unh.

902
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:36,883
Removing the old,
dead man from this property

903
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,200
won't be easy.
