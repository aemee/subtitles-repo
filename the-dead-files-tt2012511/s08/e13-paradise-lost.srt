1
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:13,952
There's a lot of people running
around in here, like, mad.

2
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,750
We've had people run
out of here screaming.

3
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,853
I think they might feel trapped
and like they can't breathe.

4
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,190
I've seen an apparition
of a little girl.

5
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,493
All these dead people, they're
feeding off of living energy.

6
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,528
This whole area is a battlefield.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,729
What's going on?

8
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:33,999
I felt like he was
gonna choke me to death.

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,702
This guy, he's not good.

10
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,104
There's a dark presence.

11
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,173
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,442
These things, they're freaking out.

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,643
They're from hell.

14
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,678
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,112
They were being hunted.

16
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,747
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,784
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

18
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,185
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,553
Her neck got broken.

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,556
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,458
I hear a gunshot.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,323
- I rely on my partner.
- I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:04,557
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,691
Something's not right here.

25
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:09,228
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,764
It's not safe here. It's
my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,232
Are any of them buried on the property?

28
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,633
They're all buried here.

29
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,502
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:18,537
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,140
Until the very end...
I can't do it no more.

32
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:23,475
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,010
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

34
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:26,445
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,180
It does not have a happy ending.

36
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:31,016
Something kills people here.

37
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:51,303
I'm in Waipahu, Hawaii,
just northwest of Honolulu.

38
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:52,872
I got a call from a guy named Jeff,

39
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,974
who says he's got trouble in paradise.

40
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:58,410
Now, he runs a museum on
an old sugar plantation.

41
00:01:58,512 --> 00:01:59,979
But business was so slow,

42
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,715
he agreed to open up a
haunted house attraction.

43
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:04,783
Since then, all hell's broken loose.

44
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,820
He says, if we can't find a solution,

45
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,388
he's gonna have to shut the place down

46
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,494
before somebody gets seriously hurt.

47
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:19,462
This is a museum with
more than a dozen buildings.

48
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:23,802
I've got to clear all of them
of any artwork, photographs

49
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:24,970
or religious symbols

50
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,575
so Amy is not influenced
by anything she sees.

51
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:32,305
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:46,825
I'm feeling a lot of stress here.

53
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:51,463
It feels like these dead
people are very stressed out.

54
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:55,467
I'm seeing, like, a
tall, glass enclosure.

55
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,437
And all these dead people were in it.

56
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:02,508
It said, "Do not let them
out. They are my pets."

57
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,243
Then, I hear,

58
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:09,715
"The earth here is as
alive as a human, more so.

59
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,984
Listen to its heartbeat."

60
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:15,921
And then, I hear, "The earth
has been asleep for 1,000 years,

61
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:18,223
and it's waking up."

62
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:30,903
Hey, Jeff. This place is amazing.

63
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,606
This is like a small city out here.

64
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,194
How many buildings
altogether do you have?

65
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,495
Do you know?

66
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,831
- Uh, about 22.
- 22?

67
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,102
- Yeah.
- Wow.

68
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:47,270
We've never done an
investigation like this.

69
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,371
I can tell you that.

70
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,707
Tell me, what's the
story? What's going on?

71
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:53,276
We've had numerous
incidents with my volunteers,

72
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:55,412
with my staff, with the general public.

73
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,815
And we're starting to
get a reputation for being

74
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,217
really a hotbed of paranormal activity.

75
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,519
Now, Jeff, you mentioned on the phone

76
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,854
you allowed a haunted
attraction to come in.

77
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:05,989
That's correct.

78
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,058
I partnered with one of my friends, Noa.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,626
So why would you do that?

80
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:12,862
Well, because we wanted
to get younger people here,

81
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:15,532
get them interested
in their own history.

82
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:18,101
So obviously, we're here.
So something backfired.

83
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,203
We've had a lot more activity.

84
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,705
We have school children here.

85
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,273
We have seniors.

86
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,741
It's becoming a real problem.

87
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,477
Okay, so tell me about
some of the experiences

88
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,611
people are having.

89
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:31,648
People have been seeing apparitions.

90
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,550
They've been seeing spirits.

91
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,618
Some people have been touched.

92
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,488
We've had workers who have
volunteered for a night

93
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,056
and never come back.

94
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,058
People run out of here screaming.

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,327
I feel very, very bad about it.

96
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:48,631
I feel like perhaps it's been my fault

97
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,700
partnering with Noa.

98
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:52,635
I'm ultimately responsible for that.

99
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:53,803
So what if Amy turned around

100
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,739
and said you need to
shut down this attraction?

101
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,374
Honestly, if we had to
shut down the whole thing,

102
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:01,010
I'm not sure that we would survive that.

103
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,178
Okay.

104
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,949
Oh, boy.

105
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,584
There are two types
of dead here...

106
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:10,420
the ones who stay inside and
the ones who stay outside.

107
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:15,525
The outside ones are the problem.

108
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,695
Yeah. They're mad.
And they've got issues.

109
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:20,296
They don't want us here.

110
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:22,966
No, no, no, no, no, no.
They don't want us here.

111
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,934
They are mostly out here, these people.

112
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,937
They stay pretty much
outside all the...

113
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,739
Pretty much all the time.

114
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:33,843
I don't think they like the people.

115
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:36,412
So they stay outside.

116
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:39,749
One of the things that they
do to the living here is,

117
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:43,153
obviously, they take their energy.

118
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,988
It's got to be difficult, I think,

119
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,356
for many people to be here

120
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,726
because I think you would
feel immediately drained.

121
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,834
So, now, what about
your own experiences?

122
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,336
Well, I have had an experience
right in this house, right here.

123
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:03,573
I was speaking to a tour
group in front of the kitchen.

124
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,175
And a couple of pots banged together.

125
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,442
Okay.

126
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,845
Were the windows open,
wind going through there?

127
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,180
No.

128
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,314
All right. Anything else?

129
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,117
Yeah. One night, I
was here with a friend.

130
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,618
And we were walking along the sidewalk.

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,754
And I looked down, and I noticed

132
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,590
that there were three
shadows instead of two.

133
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:21,858
And I knew which shadow was his

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,459
'cause he was wearing a baseball hat.

135
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:26,396
So I started to move to figure
out which shadow was mine.

136
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,432
And in between us,
there was another shadow.

137
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,301
A man, woman? Do you have any idea?

138
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:32,735
You know, in that
area, we've...

139
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:34,871
we've had other shadow activity.

140
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,273
And people always seem
to think it's a male.

141
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,942
Now, you said other people
have seen this shadow.

142
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,210
Is that common?

143
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,513
Yes, other people have
seen the shadow running

144
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:47,083
and felt somebody brush past them.

145
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,718
Let me ask you a question as far as

146
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,954
what you're hoping to get
out of this investigation.

147
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,956
I've been running this
thing for nine years.

148
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:55,992
But now, we're at a point
where we've had so many problems

149
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,094
that I don't know what to do.

150
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,230
I want to be sure that the public,

151
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:04,133
that my volunteers,
that my staff is safe.

152
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,602
Okay.

153
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:10,907
There's a man. And he
doesn't want us here.

154
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,277
I'm definitely feeling,
like, a push, like, "Ahhhh."

155
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,214
He's, like, this drunk guy, wasted.

156
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,583
I think that people
would have, possibly,

157
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,118
experiences with this man.

158
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,587
He's very solid.

159
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:29,225
I think they might feel trapped
and like they can't breathe.

160
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,828
The wasted guy's in the tunnel.

161
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,933
And what he's doing is just
bouncing back and forth,

162
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:39,602
all along in there.

163
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:43,506
I think that people would
probably see him like a shadow,

164
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:46,276
but in human form.

165
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:53,116
So, Noa, I was talking to Jeff.

166
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:54,384
And he was explaining to me

167
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:57,253
about how bad the
activity's gotten here.

168
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,455
And he seems to think that it started

169
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,458
when you guys started doing
the Halloween-type tours.

170
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,693
You agree with that?

171
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,695
I'm starting to believe
there's something.

172
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:08,598
A few actors working for me
actually quit because of...

173
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,266
- What's happened?
- Something, yeah.

174
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:13,202
Have you had any experiences
at all that you can't explain?

175
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:15,238
Yeah. I've had a few.

176
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,539
Okay. Tell me about them.

177
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,777
I would see the curtain go up and down.

178
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,478
It looked like the curtain actually,

179
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,814
like, was lifted up
and dropped, you know?

180
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,983
And you're positive nobody
was in the house at the time?

181
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,452
No. Nobody's in the house.
The doors are locked usually.

182
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:30,620
That's why.

183
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,422
Okay. Anything else?

184
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,757
I've seen an apparition
of a little girl,

185
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,893
maybe, like, around 4 or 5 years old.

186
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,394
Did you get a color hair description?

187
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,930
No, no. Maybe, like, black.

188
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,799
- It was a darker color?
- Yeah.

189
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:45,034
My partner says, when people
do these kind of attractions,

190
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:49,005
they're antagonizing the spirits
and the dead that are here.

191
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,373
Yeah. I thought about that.

192
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,042
But, you know, pretty much
the whole state of Oahu is,

193
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,511
like, a believer in this
kind of superstition.

194
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,946
What if she turned around and said

195
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:59,215
you guys need to shut this down,
or people are gonna get hurt?

196
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,850
Wouldn't really care. I
wouldn't listen to her.

197
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:02,952
I mean, we'd still be doing it.

198
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,854
I would still continue.

199
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,060
Yeah. I don't think these, you know,

200
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:13,863
many of these dead people
really want to be here.

201
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,198
There's an indication that,

202
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,568
somehow, they were
trapped here by someone.

203
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,439
People would have a really hard time

204
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,874
with the dead out here.

205
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:29,178
They're very [bleep]
present and pretty powerful.

206
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,281
And then, the ones outside,

207
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:35,385
they hate everybody
else, like, passionately.

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,886
And they would really like

209
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:40,790
to kick the other
deads' asses out of here.

210
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:42,558
They want to get rid of the living.

211
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,728
They were here first.

212
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,941
They want this back.

213
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,275
So, Moira,
talking to Jeff, he seems

214
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,442
to feel guilty about what he started

215
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,378
with this ghost tour thing,
that it was a bad idea.

216
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,046
Do you agree with that at all?

217
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,782
I agree. I didn't think
they should have done it,

218
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:24,118
energize more spirits
in different houses

219
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,488
and got them to be really active.

220
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,523
Can I assume you've
had experiences or not?

221
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,825
Yes.

222
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,594
We seen a shadow by the Portuguese House

223
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:37,131
of a man, and you could fully see him.

224
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,968
And he just, poof, vanished.

225
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,136
Okay. Anything else?

226
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:45,139
So, we walked over to the Social Club,

227
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,643
and we were standing
outside after a tour ended.

228
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,412
And a door was
latched open, and it...

229
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,814
Someone unlatched it,
and it just slammed shut.

230
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,549
And some people started running.

231
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,585
Okay. What was the weather like?

232
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,287
Still, no wind.

233
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,088
- Like it is now?
- Yes.

234
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,523
Okay. Is there anything else?

235
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,292
There's a doll case that's in here.

236
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,093
And every morning,
they would come back in

237
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:07,528
to make sure everything's clean,

238
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,864
presentable for the next
tours during the day.

239
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,532
The doll would be out on the ground.

240
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,034
This case is enclosed.

241
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,870
So it got to the point where
you'd come in every morning,

242
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:17,672
and the thing would be
open, the doll would be out?

243
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:18,839
Yes.

244
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:20,341
Now, are you sure nobody
was playing a prank?

245
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:21,342
Yes.

246
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:22,843
How do we know that?

247
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:24,011
'Cause they always

248
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,613
close the windows and
lock everything up.

249
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,615
One day, someone thought
they saw a little girl

250
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:28,916
that was in here.

251
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,918
So we think that she's
been playing with the doll.

252
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:32,983
Okay, so you think the
spirit of a young child

253
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,918
might have been taking the
doll out to play with it

254
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,220
- when everybody went home?
- Yes.

255
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:38,589
That's kind of sad, actually,
when you think about it.

256
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:39,905
Yes, it is.

257
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,325
Moira, with all the stuff
that's going on here,

258
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,628
I've got to ask you, why are you
so interested in working here?

259
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,630
It's kind of important
to my side of the family.

260
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,932
My grandmother, she
worked on the plantation.

261
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:49,600
- This plantation?
- Yes.

262
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,202
Okay. So you're telling family history.

263
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,003
Yes.

264
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,738
Okay.

265
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,011
There's a lot of people here

266
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:02,547
who didn't get along
when they were alive.

267
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,850
And now, it's even worse
because they're dead.

268
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:08,620
All these dead people, they're
feeding off of living energy.

269
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,989
And all this combined energy

270
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,726
is creating poltergeist-type
of phenomenon,

271
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,496
things ending up in places
where they weren't left,

272
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,833
things flying across the room,
doors opening and closing,

273
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:25,770
and objects moving.

274
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,338
They're prepping for something.

275
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:30,809
Something's gonna happen...

276
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,812
something really bad.

277
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,353
All right, so now, it seems like

278
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,155
everybody's having experiences here.

279
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:45,290
But what about yourself?

280
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,958
I've had some experiences here, too.

281
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,694
Okay. Explain some of them to me.

282
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,964
Um, I'm pretty exhausted
when I leave here,

283
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,733
nauseated, dizzy.

284
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,252
Why do you think it's paranormal?

285
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,657
I'm really healthy.

286
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:02,874
So are you the only one having
these physical experiences here?

287
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,476
Oh, there's other actors, too,

288
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,778
that have either injuries or illnesses.

289
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,581
Okay. Anything else?

290
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:10,882
There were a few times

291
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:13,785
when I came home with bruises
on my body, unexplained.

292
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,621
Looks like a hand print,
like little fingerprints.

293
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,857
Having bruising could be
a million-and-one things.

294
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,425
But you're saying it
was the shape of a hand?

295
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:21,593
Mm-hmm.

296
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:22,694
Did you feel it?

297
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:23,862
No. Oh, no.

298
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,530
That's why I was
surprised when I got home

299
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,397
and I had that bruise.

300
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,765
Anything else?

301
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:31,002
Yeah, there was an experience
that sticks in my mind.

302
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,437
I got home from work,

303
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:36,074
and I had a choking
sensation out of nowhere.

304
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:37,442
And it was pretty scary.

305
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:38,843
And I started to pray.

306
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,011
And what happened?

307
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,847
It eventually went
away, after my prayers.

308
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,787
Oh, geez.

309
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,957
You okay?

310
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,928
What's going on? Um, I got attacked.

311
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,296
I'm, like, freaked out.

312
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,198
There's a guy, um,

313
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,067
and he doesn't want me here.

314
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,436
He's, like, really aggressive.

315
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,638
Like, first, I didn't know...

316
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,206
I didn't understand what was happening.

317
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:09,474
But he got really mad.

318
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:15,513
And so he was like,
grabbing me like this...

319
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:18,082
...really hard.

320
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,517
And I got scared

321
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:25,023
because I felt like he was
gonna choke me to death.

322
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,325
I think that he can
physically harm people,

323
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:30,395
choke them out or scare
the [bleep] out of me.

324
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,063
Like, I'm still scared.

325
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,566
Jeffrey's property is
on an old sugar plantation.

326
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,867
And you know what?

327
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:49,368
It doesn't take a homicide detective

328
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,270
to figure out where to
start this investigation.

329
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:52,905
I'm on my way back to the property

330
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,273
to meet a local historian,

331
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,742
who said the conditions
there were absolutely brutal.

332
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,783
What do you know about
the history of this place?

333
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,052
It was built in 1897,

334
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,087
and it stayed open for almost 100 years.

335
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,888
Wow.

336
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,590
It was about 10,000 acres,

337
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,158
extended all the way
down to Pearl Harbor,

338
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,126
which is that way.

339
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,530
There are close to 1,000
people that worked here.

340
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:18,831
All right. So do me a favor.

341
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,233
Paint the picture. What's
their work day like?

342
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,701
So, you leave before sunrise.

343
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,670
You spend the entire day
working on the plantation.

344
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,138
Back-breaking work.

345
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:29,675
Now, the people who worked here,
did they live here, as well?

346
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:30,843
Lived and died.

347
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,411
What were living conditions like?

348
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,447
Well, can you imagine
coming home to a house

349
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,584
that has a corrugated tin
roof and your floor is dirt?

350
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:42,154
The health conditions are
just unbelievably just filthy.

351
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,624
You were lucky if your
baby lived to see a year.

352
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:45,958
Geez.

353
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,094
Are these native Hawaiians
that are in this picture?

354
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,063
Native Hawaiians were
decimated by sicknesses.

355
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:54,533
And so plantation bosses,
the chief laborers,

356
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:57,236
had to go elsewhere to find
other people to bring here

357
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:58,638
to work the plantation,

358
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,207
like the Japanese, the
Chinese, the Filipinos,

359
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,543
the Puerto Ricans, Portuguese
and even the Koreans.

360
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,145
Okay, so now, with all these different

361
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,447
cultures and ethnicities here,
did they all live together?

362
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:09,782
What was the story?

363
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:13,753
According to this map, everybody
was separated by ethnicity.

364
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,088
Now, is that by the people
that worked here's choice

365
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,556
or by the people that owned the place?

366
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,191
People that owned the place.

367
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:21,427
They wanted to make sure that
these different ethnicities

368
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,696
didn't get together
and unionize and demand

369
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,865
better living conditions and better pay.

370
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,033
So they thought it was a better thing

371
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,435
to keep them segregated,

372
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,437
even to the point where
they began to pay people

373
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,573
a different rate
according to the ethnicity.

374
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,575
So, what was the purpose of
paying people differently?

375
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,311
To make sure that they
resented each other

376
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:40,713
and they didn't get along.

377
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,768
Okay.

378
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,651
These dead people
who are lined up outside,

379
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:47,820
they were, like, neglected
or mistreated or something

380
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,388
when they were alive.

381
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,993
I think that they were kind
of starving at some point.

382
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:58,030
They don't seem like they
had good clothing, either.

383
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,901
Doesn't seem like they
had good shelter, either.

384
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,370
They were outside a lot.

385
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:07,106
They're pretty old. I
don't know from when.

386
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,674
There's a lot of people here

387
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,243
who didn't get along
when they were alive.

388
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,412
And now, it's even worse
because they're dead

389
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:15,448
and they're all [bleep]
jumbled together.

390
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,719
Yeah. They're really mad.

391
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,154
Look, when you got that
many people packed together

392
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:23,189
under bad conditions,

393
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,558
there's definitely gonna be violence.

394
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,094
I had a retired detective
look into it for me.

395
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,529
Says she found at least 10 homicides

396
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:32,264
right on the plantation.

397
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,772
Chris, I don't think I've
ever handled an investigation

398
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:41,874
where I had at least 10
homicides in one location.

399
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,744
Here's some of them.

400
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,645
Okay.

401
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,881
Did any of these stand out to you?

402
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:52,752
Yes. April 5th of 1905.

403
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,987
A captain in the police department,

404
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,524
a lieutenant and four officers
are asked to assist a sheriff

405
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:03,162
in raiding a gambling
game on the plantation.

406
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:06,665
They arrested 11 Chinese laborers.

407
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:07,767
Okay.

408
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,369
All of a sudden, all hell breaks loose.

409
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,304
Police and the prisoners get surrounded

410
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:15,007
by the rest of the laborers
that are at the gambling game.

411
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,308
Okay.

412
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:20,046
Now they are being attacked
with clubs and sticks.

413
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,048
Shots are fired.

414
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,451
In the chaos, a laborer
named Chong Chi Fat

415
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,486
was shot six times and was killed.

416
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,055
Do we know who shoots him?

417
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:33,859
There was never a determination
of who actually shot the man.

418
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:35,761
Okay.

419
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:39,965
I'm just hearing people
yelling numbers or something,

420
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,200
some numbers.

421
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:44,870
But it's, like, you know, "Eight, nine,

422
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,506
two, zero, four, five, six! Ah!

423
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:48,874
Three, nine, eight!"

424
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:51,043
You know, like, somebody's
[bleep] yelling all this...

425
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,279
These numbers.

426
00:18:55,416 --> 00:19:00,052
I'm hearing, um, a man
screaming and crying.

427
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:04,390
It feels like his back is broken.

428
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:08,761
Like, he is, like, on his forearms.

429
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:10,529
He's looking at the ground.

430
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:15,367
And there's something
on his back and his neck.

431
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,938
He's just [bleep] screaming.

432
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,841
Okay, so what was the other
homicide you were talking about?

433
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,876
Well, in May 1985,

434
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:27,680
we have a man that was
killed at a cock fight,

435
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,916
which was across from
the plantation housing.

436
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:32,585
And his name is Henry Cuba.

437
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:35,287
All right, so what's this guy
get killed for? What happened?

438
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,124
Mr. Cuba had gotten into
altercations with the guy

439
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,092
that was running the chicken fight.

440
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,728
And he also got into another altercation

441
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,865
and was acting belligerent
and out of control

442
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,366
with Jaime Fernandez.

443
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:48,634
Who's this Fernandez guy?

444
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,402
Just someone watching the fights?

445
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,604
Yes.

446
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:52,838
By the way you're
telling the story to me,

447
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,440
it sounds like this
guy showed up already

448
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,042
a little bit inebriated.

449
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,245
So what's the circumstances
of this guy getting killed?

450
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:02,414
Well, Fernandez went back
to his house, got his gun,

451
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,583
came back to the chicken fight

452
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:07,920
and shot him four times in the chest.

453
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,455
Okay. Is he D.O.A. right there?

454
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:12,024
And he died right there on the scene.

455
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,159
Okay.

456
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:16,862
That drunk dude is, like, wasted.

457
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,297
And he's, like,

458
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:21,834
running around, like,
just acting like a fool.

459
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,605
Hmm. He's a big guy.

460
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:28,941
He's not that old.

461
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,478
I'd say, like, you know,
between 30 and 40 years of age.

462
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,380
And he died...

463
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,715
This was fairly recently,

464
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,066
I would say within the last 20 years.

465
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:41,320
But he's yelling about the animals.

466
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:44,056
Like, all the animals died?

467
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,257
There's a lot of confusion.

468
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,327
Like, if you try to ask
him certain questions,

469
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,717
he gets very confused.

470
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,799
I really don't think that, right now,

471
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:56,735
he doesn't understand that he's dead.

472
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,511

473

unexplained activity in your home,

Files," to submit your story,

477
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:24,550
So far, I know a deadly
riot and at least 10 homicides

478
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:27,419
took place on my client's property.

479
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:29,755
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

480
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:33,159
Searching through old records,

481
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:36,544
I find the plantation shared
a border with Pearl Harbor

482
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:39,565
and that two people on Jeff's property

483
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,902
were actually killed during the attack.

484
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,037
I'm heading over to the
Naval base to meet with

485
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,540
one of the world's foremost
authorities on Pearl Harbor.

486
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:50,342
And he says Jeffrey's plantation
played an important role

487
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,313
in that dark day in American history.

488
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:03,756
Right here, this
is where it all started.

489
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,057
So, during the attack,

490
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,059
what am I seeing from
my client's property?

491
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,762
You are seeing aircraft
buzzing about you like bees.

492
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:11,397
You are seeing, in the distance,

493
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,098
the Pacific fleet being destroyed.

494
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,000
This whole area's a battlefield.

495
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,736
So where your clients were
was part of the battlefield.

496
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:21,893
There's indication that Japanese
aircrafts strafed that camp.

497
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:24,360
And probably from a Japanese
pilot's point of view,

498
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:25,828
it looked like a military camp.

499
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,899
The two killed on my property
during the day of the attack,

500
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,033
Is that from the Japanese fire?

501
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:32,134
It's not.

502
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:34,670
The indication is, it was friendly fire

503
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,940
that was raining down all
over the island of Oahu

504
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:41,343
from the anti-aircraft guns
firing at the Japanese planes.

505
00:22:41,446 --> 00:22:43,546
Now, what can you tell
me about the victims?

506
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:45,414
There's a report that I have here.

507
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,717
It indicates a Hawaiian
girl, 3 years of age,

508
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,519
was hit by shrapnel.

509
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,823
She died within 10 minutes of
being admitted to the hospital.

510
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:57,827
And then, a 19-year-old
man, Tomaso Kimura,

511
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,629
suffered a shrapnel wound
that penetrated his brain.

512
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,566
He lost his life at
about 5:00 that afternoon,

513
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:06,635
December 7, 1941.

514
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,205
Oh, geez.

515
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:13,108
I'm, like, hearing
yelling, [bleep] screaming.

516
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,544
There's dirt and debris hitting my eyes,

517
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,313
blinding so many people,

518
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,281
like, so many people having this happen.

519
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:23,519
Like, this dirt and all this
[bleep] is hitting their face.

520
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,720
I can't breathe.

521
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:26,822
Awful breathing problems, asphyxiation,

522
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:28,691
incredibly dizzy and nauseous.

523
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:34,330
And I feel, like, lots
of sticks piercing my body

524
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:37,867
on my right jaw, my neck,
my left eye, my right side.

525
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,007
So, Daniel, I'm aware
that Japanese immigrants,

526
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:46,709
as well as Japanese Americans,

527
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,177
worked on the plantation.

528
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:50,613
Were they ever put in internment camps?

529
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:51,413
Yes.

530
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:52,681
After the attack,

531
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:55,718
there was a suspicion that
the local Japanese population

532
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,586
was somehow involved with it.

533
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:01,657
There was arrests made,
and they were interned.

534
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,759
The camp was established
on your property

535
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,094
that you're investigating.

536
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:09,365
It was known as Honouliuli.
And this is what it looked like.

537
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,233
It was over 160 acres,

538
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:13,836
barbed-wire fences
nearly eight feet tall,

539
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,070
eight guard towers.

540
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:16,505
It almost looks like a base.

541
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:18,407
What was the population like this place?

542
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,742
Well, there was two populations.

543
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:22,778
Initially, 322 Japanese Americans

544
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,946
were interned.

545
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,015
Later on, as the months
progressed into the war,

546
00:24:26,117 --> 00:24:27,182
there'll be a population

547
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,385
of Italian Americans
and German Americans,

548
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:31,353
Koreans, were brought here

549
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:34,089
because they were considered
possibilities of disloyalty.

550
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:37,826
And here's some of their dossiers.

551
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,528
So, what were the conditions
like for these people?

552
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,998
Let's put it this way. They
called it Hell's Canyon.

553
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,235
They lived in tents. They
had latrines they went to.

554
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:49,104
It was hot, dusty, uncomfortable.

555
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:50,973
It would be over 90 to 100 degrees

556
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,107
in that canyon.

557
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,610
So, it starts out as a plantation...

558
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:56,145
And then a battlefield,

559
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:59,848
and then an internment
and prisoner-of-war camp.

560
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:12,027
Something about a camp.

561
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,463
I don't know. A bunch of people
talking all at the same time.

562
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:16,332
I can't understand any of it.

563
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:18,400
Somebody's freaking out about the camp.

564
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,302
Camp... Stop the
camp? I don't know.

565
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:21,604
Something like this.

566
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,305
You're just overhearing random snippets?

567
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah. They're having,
like, meetings, like,

568
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:26,842
"Should we talk about
these things or not?"

569
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,948
Oh.

570
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:37,886
I feel a lot of anxiousness,
stress, illness immediately.

571
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:40,222
It's like a [bleep] tidal wave of it.

572
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:42,591
There's a lot of people
running around in here

573
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:45,194
like mad, like mad,
prepping for something.

574
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,229
Something's gonna
happen. They need to talk.

575
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:49,598
They need to take care
of the situation promptly.

576
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,300
Something big, big, big is happening,

577
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:52,901
and they're freaking
the [bleep] out about it.

578
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,771
Whoo, so [bleep] stressful.

579
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:57,339
Holy [bleep]

580
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:00,209
My god, it's like whoosh.

581
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,978
Like, crazy, crazy, crazy.

582
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:11,687
I encountered many dead
people during my walk.

583
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,224
But the angry group outside
had me the most concerned.

584
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:21,363
I saw these people.

585
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:25,234
They were all lined up, side by side.

586
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:27,836
They were very upset.

587
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:30,339
Basically, they want to
destroy the living here.

588
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,741
They don't want anything to live here.

589
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:40,863
Is this what you saw?

590
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,786
Yes.

591
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:06,198
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

592
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,467
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

593
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,463
and our clients for the first time.

594
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,346
So, Amy, I'm sure this walk

595
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,515
must have been a little
disorienting for you

596
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,650
because the property here is so big.

597
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,352
Mm-hmm.

598
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:20,920
I don't want to give away too much,

599
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:25,191
but this place used to be
a major sugar plantation.

600
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,293
And now, it's a museum.

601
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,428
Now, this is Jeff.

602
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,830
He's been running the
place for almost 10 years.

603
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:34,667
This is Laura and Moira.
They both work here.

604
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,503
Activity is bad and getting worse.

605
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:40,490
And Jeff is concerned
that, if they can't stop it,

606
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,590
this important part of Hawaii's history

607
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,091
may not survive.

608
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:45,259
So with that,

609
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,795
Amy knows a little
bit about the location.

610
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,864
I'll ask her to
describe her walk for us.

611
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,937
When I first arrived, I
got a lot of information.

612
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,407
I was feeling the
emotions from the dead.

613
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,845
And they seemed very stressed out.

614
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:10,084
Then, I was seeing this
kind of glass dome structure.

615
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:13,621
And inside of it was all of the dead.

616
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,290
And I heard someone say,

617
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:20,327
"Don't let them out. These are my pets."

618
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,530
Well, might as well get right into this.

619
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:26,033
When Jeff took over the
museum, business was slow.

620
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:30,704
So a friend of his came with
an idea to turn this museum

621
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:33,240
into a haunted attraction for 10 nights

622
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:35,442
during the month of October.

623
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,044
And that's when activity went nuts.

624
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,045
Okay.

625
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:40,881
So that's why they called us in.

626
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,384
Now, tell Amy why you
thought you had to do this.

627
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:44,985
Young people aren't exactly

628
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:47,288
that interested in history sometimes.

629
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,624
So we thought a haunted attraction would

630
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:53,427
appeal to a younger demographic.

631
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,992
Moira, when we spoke originally,

632
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,593
you said you weren't
crazy about the idea

633
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,896
of this haunted attraction.

634
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:01,664
My parents and my grandparents

635
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:04,967
would tell me that there's
strange things that happen here.

636
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:06,669
My mom would tell me,
you know, "Be careful,"

637
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:11,240
that the spirits that was here
would probably attack a person.

638
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:14,377
Now, I talked to the guy
that runs the attraction.

639
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,711
His name's Noa.

640
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,213
I was thinking about
bringing him to the reveal,

641
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:18,915
but, honestly, it was a waste of time.

642
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,584
He told me he didn't really
care what you would have to say,

643
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:23,486
and nothing would convince
him that what he's doing

644
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:24,820
is a bad thing.

645
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:27,990
Jeff, on the other hand,
thinks he's opened a door.

646
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:30,660
And he thinks that they can't close it.

647
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:34,597
I'm really concerned about
the increase in activity.

648
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:37,367
And it's more confrontational now.

649
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:41,133
It's kind of in-your-face
and very direct.

650
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:45,308
Yeah, there's a lot of different
things going on as far as

651
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,511
how the dead are interpreting
what you're doing.

652
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:51,244
So some are irritated
and some are frightened

653
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:53,466
and some are confused.

654
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:58,603
I looked in the tunnel,
and I saw this man.

655
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,011
He was kind of a mess.

656
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,494
He had a special
attachment to this property.

657
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,763
He used to be here a lot.

658
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,899
I got that he was
probably in his 30s or 40s.

659
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:13,302
And he died fairly recently,
within the last 20 years.

660
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:17,573
And he was drunk when he died.

661
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:21,344
And what I got that the
living might encounter there

662
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,348
is hearing him bang into the
walls and things like that.

663
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,383
And I believe that they would see him

664
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:31,703
as a very, very dark, large shadow.

665
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,756
Tell Amy that story.

666
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,925
One day, I was walking with a friend.

667
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:37,627
And we were just walking down the path.

668
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:38,828
And then, I looked down,

669
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,296
and I noticed there's
only the two of us,

670
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:42,665
but there's three shadows on the ground.

671
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,501
And I just kept looking at
that as we walked down the path.

672
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:47,349
I was so surprised.

673
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:49,171
What I found shocking about the property

674
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:50,273
during my investigation

675
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,575
is the amount of homicides
and strange deaths

676
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,610
that occurred on the property.

677
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:58,714
One of the most recent deaths
may be of interest to you.

678
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,617
Now, back in '85, a group
of plantation employees

679
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:05,628
used to hold illegal cock
fights on the land here.

680
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:08,124
Now, there was a guy named Henry Cuba

681
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:10,493
who used to come here all the time.

682
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:14,730
May of 1985, he came here,
but he got into a fight

683
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,033
with the guy running the cock fight

684
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,625
and a couple of the patrons.

685
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:22,392
It sounded like he was pretty
belligerent, and he was drunk.

686
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,785
He gets into a fight with
this guy, Jaime Fernandez.

687
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:27,443
This guy gets mad.

688
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:29,645
He goes back to his house,
grabs a gun, comes back

689
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,447
and plants four in this guy's chest.

690
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:32,915
Wow.

691
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,151
And he kills him right here.

692
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,982
Now, you said the man
was between 30 and 40.

693
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:41,349
Cuba was 40 when he got gunned down.

694
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:46,623
I actually managed to track
down a photo from the family.

695
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:48,916
This is him, here.

696
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:51,929
This guy look familiar to you?

697
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,065
Yeah, totally. Yeah.

698
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,166
All right. So that's interesting.

699
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,735
At least you know who
the shadow might be.

700
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,273
Okay. So what else?

701
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:07,578
I was standing on the
porch, and I got attacked.

702
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,781
This person came up from
behind and to my side

703
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:11,960
and grabbed my neck.

704
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,329
Like, I was being choked
and was squeezing so hard.

705
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:20,144
And it was excruciating pain.

706
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,910
Then, he was standing in the doorway,

707
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:24,980
and he was, like, a dark,
tall, you know, shadow figure.

708
00:32:25,082 --> 00:32:29,093
And I got that he, obviously,
doesn't want me here,

709
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:31,059
doesn't want anybody here.

710
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,462
He's aggressive.

711
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:37,165
I think that the living would
have experiences with him

712
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:39,860
and could possibly get physically hurt.

713
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:44,640
One night that I went home
after doing the attraction,

714
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:48,244
I had a choking sensation.

715
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:51,847
I just started praying, and I just said,

716
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,450
"Rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus."

717
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,585
- And it just went away.
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,821
And then, I also, another
night, had a bruise on my arms,

719
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,923
like somebody was grabbing me.

720
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:02,424
Now, does that sound like

721
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,526
something that this guy might do?

722
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:10,799
Yeah. And he is not good.

723
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,271
Anything else?

724
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:19,608
There's a lot of issues
here between the dead people.

725
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:23,126
The dead who stay outside,

726
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:26,997
they spent a lot of time
outside when they were alive.

727
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,932
And they still like to be outside

728
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,801
even though they're deceased.

729
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,369
They were telling me

730
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,038
that they were mistreated
when they were alive.

731
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,339
They didn't have good clothing.

732
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,108
They didn't have a lot of food.

733
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,844
And their shelter was not so great.

734
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:43,947
They didn't get along
that well with each other

735
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,615
when they were alive.

736
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:47,250
They're very unsettled.
They're very mad.

737
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:48,552
They're very angry.

738
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:51,555
And I heard, "The camp,
the camp. Stop the camp."

739
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:55,158
Okay, well, the history of
this place is pretty incredible.

740
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,028
There's two possibilities of
what you might have been seeing.

741
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,197
As I mentioned before,
the museum sits on the land

742
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,566
that used to be the
Oahu Sugar Plantation.

743
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:03,667
Right.

744
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:05,435
Now, the plantation ran
for almost 100 years,

745
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:09,039
from 1897 to 1995.

746
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,208
In the beginning, there
weren't enough local workers.

747
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,143
So the plantation
owners brought people in

748
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,478
from around the world.

749
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,880
Now, the conditions
these workers lived in

750
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:18,215
was horrible.

751
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:21,751
They lived in tin-roofed
houses with this heat

752
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,854
and, basically, dirt floors.

753
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,022
Now, you mentioned that
the different groups

754
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:27,424
didn't like each other.

755
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:32,429
Well, the plantation owners
were worried they may unionize.

756
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:36,433
So they made segregated camps.

757
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,202
And they would pay each
ethnic group a different wage

758
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,505
so that they would resent each other.

759
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,508
Now, there is one other possibility.

760
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,443
When this place was a plantation,

761
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:49,079
it actually touched the
shores of Pearl Harbor.

762
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,515
Now, when Pearl Harbor
was bombed in '41,

763
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:53,783
the Americans fired
at the Japanese planes.

764
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:57,053
And you had two fatalities
right on the property

765
00:34:57,155 --> 00:34:58,889
from friendly fire.

766
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,558
The day after the attack,
martial law is imposed,

767
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,294
and the military rounded
up Japanese immigrants

768
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,695
and Japanese Americans,

769
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:07,364
and they placed them
in an internment camp

770
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:08,431
right on this property.

771
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,300
Oh.

772
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:13,537
And I got photos of that.

773
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,438
The conditions were so bad at this camp,

774
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:18,308
they called it Hell's Canyon.

775
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,609
As the war waged on,

776
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:22,045
not only did they bring
Japanese P.O.W.s here.

777
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:23,747
They brought in German, Italian,

778
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,949
and kept them separated
in the same camp.

779
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,919
So based on the
information that I provided,

780
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:31,321
who do you think you
might have ran into?

781
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:36,760
I think that they're
probably from both camps.

782
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:40,297
And I think they're from
different time periods.

783
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,332
Now, Moira, your grandparents
worked on this plantation.

784
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,466
Yes.

785
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:44,801
How's that make you
feel, hearing all this?

786
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:46,102
It's, like, sad.

787
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:48,138
We didn't even realize
how many of them were here.

788
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,274
It's sad to see them, you
know, get caught in here.

789
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:53,109
I wouldn't want to be caught here.

790
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:54,878
So now, the dead people on the outside,

791
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,347
do they interact with
the living in any way?

792
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,516
They feed off the energy of the living.

793
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:02,319
So I think that, when
people would leave here,

794
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:07,090
they would feel excessively drained.

795
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:09,492
Like, also, people would
feel stressed and anxious

796
00:36:09,595 --> 00:36:10,994
because they are so angry.

797
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:12,529
The other thing that I got

798
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:17,567
is that they've become able to
interact with their environment.

799
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:22,639
And so they can make
doors open and close.

800
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:26,343
They're able to move objects
from one location to another

801
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:29,713
and also move objects,
like, in front of you.

802
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:34,451
Well, now you're hitting
on pretty much everything

803
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:35,919
these guys are experiencing.

804
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:38,188
Moira, tell Amy about the doll.

805
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,991
We have a doll. It's in a Japanese case.

806
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:43,593
How they built it was with
glass on both sides of the wood.

807
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:45,962
Every morning, when we came to
make sure everything was clean,

808
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:48,531
nothing was messed, the
doll would be outside.

809
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:50,667
Tell her about the
story right in this room.

810
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,203
We were standing outside on the porch.

811
00:36:53,305 --> 00:36:56,506
So the door's really
heavy, and it was latched.

812
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:59,075
And all of a sudden, the
door just slammed really hard.

813
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,143
Everybody else jumped.

814
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:02,379
We saw some people run the other way.

815
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,482
Laura, tell Amy about
co-workers getting sick.

816
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:11,721
Getting dizzy, nauseated,
kind of a streak of the flu.

817
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,205
I'm pretty exhausted when I leave here.

818
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:15,239
So does that make sense?

819
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,975
Yes.

820
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:19,477
I did do a sketch

821
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:22,947
of some of the outside
people that I encountered

822
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,349
and how they are draining the living.

823
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,726
Take a look at this.

824
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:36,894
Oh, God.

825
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:38,329
Oh, my gosh.

826
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,297
Uh-huh.

827
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:46,223
That explains why I feel
the way I do sometimes.

828
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,439
What do these people want?

829
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,643
The majority of them feel
that they were here first

830
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:53,478
and this was their land.

831
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,781
So their common goal, the
people who live outside,

832
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,583
is to drive out everyone here.

833
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:01,386
They want the dead gone, and
they want the living gone.

834
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,022
Wow. Oh, my God.

835
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:07,925
How's that make you
feel, hearing all this?

836
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:10,594
Just really freaks me out.

837
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:13,998
I'm just stunned.

838
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I can understand why
all this is happening,

839
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:17,868
to know how many spirits are here.

840
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,205
It's like they have no rest.

841
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,107
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable

842
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,050
coming back here to work.

843
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:42,363
One thing I've learned
this week is that Hawaiians

844
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:45,533
have a very different
attitude about the paranormal.

845
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:47,302
You believe in spirits,

846
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:50,038
and you believe in respecting the dead.

847
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,307
So I know you want to make
sure this place is safe

848
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,776
for both the living and the dead.

849
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:59,814
To find out how you can do that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

850
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:04,085
I think that, if you do a few things,

851
00:39:04,187 --> 00:39:06,854
it'll help a great deal.

852
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:09,691
The first thing that
I would have you do,

853
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:12,927
because you have such
an eclectic group here,

854
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:17,031
is to find various religious leaders.

855
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,234
And then, those
individuals would proceed

856
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:24,539
to do funeral rites from their faith.

857
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:27,342
This would assist the dead that are here

858
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:30,712
from that particular religion
to go ahead and move on.

859
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:33,047
Then, what I would have you do

860
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:37,418
is bring in maybe three
or four different mediums

861
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,857
to do a walk and see if
they find any dead people

862
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:47,328
that couldn't move on
because they don't have

863
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,731
a particular faith that they follow.

864
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,667
The mediums will help
those dead move on.

865
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,553
Okay, so, what about the
guy that's choking people?

866
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:59,774
I think that he probably
would prefer to move on.

867
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,642
But if you have any more incidents,

868
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:05,780
then you're going to need
to bring in an exorcist.

869
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:11,820
Now, as far as the haunted tours go,

870
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:15,690
maybe toning it down just a smidge.

871
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,359
How can we tone it down?

872
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,660
You know, maybe only having,

873
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:22,097
like, one or two of the locations open.

874
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,298
Yeah, that would be nice.

875
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,301
I mean, it wasn't as bad
when you first started.

876
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:29,504
The years pass on,
and it got more spooky.

877
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:31,039
It really got worse.

878
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:35,977
How's your boy, Noa, gonna
take this toning down stuff?

879
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,048
Well, I think we can work it out.

880
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,118
What are you shaking your head for?

881
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,653
I mean, I don't want to disappoint,

882
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,421
but I don't think he's gonna like it.

883
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,890
You gonna talk to him, or
you just gonna, you know?

884
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:50,392
Of course I'm gonna talk to him.

885
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:53,962
I mean, he needs us, you know?

886
00:40:54,064 --> 00:40:56,297
Now, Laura, if Jeff
follows Amy's advice,

887
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,565
will you come back?

888
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,868
Yeah.

889
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,290
It's encouraging to
know that we can help

890
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,558
the dead that are here.

891
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,629
And that's, I think, what
our hope was to begin with.

892
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,399
It's been a real education.

893
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,667
I'll ask you first. You
gonna take Amy's advice?

894
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,935
Yeah, definitely.

895
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:18,045
I mean, to do nothing
would just make it worse.

896
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,842
Whatever will make this place better.

897
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:22,509
I'm gonna make sure he's gonna
do what he's supposed to do.

898
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,344
It's very important.

899
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,315
I really hope Jeff follows my advice,

900
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,951
or the dead will continue
to put all those who visit

901
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,586
in harm's way.

902
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:35,022
But I believe, if he
performs funeral rites,

903
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:38,025
brings in mediums and
tones down the haunted tour,

904
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:39,159
the dead will move on,

905
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,361
and this important
piece of Hawaii's history

906
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,564
can stay open for years to come.
