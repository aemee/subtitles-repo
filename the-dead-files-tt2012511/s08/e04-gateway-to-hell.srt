1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,273
This is a guy who has
killed several people.

2
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:16,278
She calls him "the big, scary man."

3
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:18,011
Something grabbed my chest.

4
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:20,013
My eyes were pitch-black.

5
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:22,482
We're dealing with a demon.

6
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:24,517
You don't mess with my kids.

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,086
"I'm gonna tear your [Bleep] apart."

8
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:30,723
Bad, bad little girl.

9
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,259
There's a dark presence.

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,328
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:37,330
These things, they're freaking out.

12
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:38,498
They're from hell.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,565
I see dead people.

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,864
They were being hunted.

15
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,599
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,501
They were setting people on fire,

17
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,602
burning them alive.

18
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:46,736
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,971
Her neck got broken.

20
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:51,229
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,229
I hear a gunshot.

22
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:54,504
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,204
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,006
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,174
Something's not right here.

26
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:02,544
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,611
It's not safe here.

28
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,080
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,314
Are any of them buried on the property?

30
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,515
They're all buried here.

31
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,984
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,020
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,054
Until the very end...

34
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,356
I can't do it no more.

35
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,758
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,626
Holy [Bleep] Look at this.

37
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,894
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,563
It does not have a happy ending.

39
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,832
Something kills people here.

40
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,115
I'm out here in the small
town of Lake Jackson, Texas.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,533
It's about an hour south of Houston.

42
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,852
I got called in by a mother of four.

43
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,954
Now, she sounded bad,

44
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,724
says whatever's in the house
is torturing her family.

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,460
They've been pushed, scratched, bruised,

46
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,779
and had things thrown at them.

47
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:57,499
She's fighting mad and
says if we can't help her,

48
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,435
someone's gonna get seriously hurt.

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,806
Before Amy arrives,

50
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,976
I clear the area of
any leading information.

51
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,645
Photographs, personal items,

52
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,815
and names throughout this house
need to be covered or removed.

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,252
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,066
There's this little
girl, and she comes out.

55
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,468
And her name's Casey.

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,969
And she has long blonde hair,

57
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,972
and she's, like, got
this little dress on.

58
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,341
Uh, she's probably
like 8 or 9 years old,

59
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,012
and she said, "If you
don't believe in God,

60
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:47,248
you're dead and going to Hell."

61
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,750
So as she's, like, saying that,

62
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:52,987
she, like, gets all demonic-looking.

63
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,291
And then, this creepy guy comes up.

64
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,893
And he looks like seven-foot,

65
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,429
like, trying to be
intimidating and scary.

66
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,164
This guy

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,520
is definitely interacting
with several people here.

68
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,806
I think this is a guy who
has killed several people.

69
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:22,150
So, Lisa, when
we spoke on the phone,

70
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,869
you sounded scared, but you
also sounded really angry.

71
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:25,987
It's hard.

72
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,673
It's really hard, and
it gets harder every day.

73
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,644
I just want to, like, break
down and cry and scream,

74
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,662
but if I lose it, my kids'll lose it.

75
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,431
We're done, you know? We're done.

76
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,500
This is our final straw.

77
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,437
All of our eggs are in this basket.

78
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,773
So who exactly lives here with you?

79
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,226
We have my partner, Jennifer;

80
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:51,346
my son Gary Paul; my daughter Victoria;

81
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,883
my daughter Jillian; my
son Ayden; and myself.

82
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,221
You have a special-needs child?

83
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,537
- It's Victoria.
- Victoria.

84
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,755
- And how old is Victoria?
- 11.

85
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:02,141
- What is her special need?
- She has Down syndrome.

86
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:02,639
Okay.

87
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,790
Give me an idea of exactly
what's happening in the house.

88
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:10,145
It started out with doors
opening, doors closing.

89
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:12,714
Then, it was, like, noises.

90
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:17,303
Now we're seeing
apparitions, shadow people,

91
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:18,885
and it's getting physical.

92
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,170
You know, I can't tell my kids,

93
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:22,976
"Don't be scared of the dark,"
because I'm scared of the dark.

94
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,977
I'm scared of everything that we see.

95
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,946
I'm scared of what's gonna happen next.

96
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:32,449
You know, you just don't
feel like you're ever alone.

97
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,001
You feel like you're
being watched constantly.

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,823
You know, it's like,
"Am I losing my mind?"

99
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:41,358
Just looking at you, I can see

100
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:42,926
it's taken an emotional toll on you.

101
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,060
Yeah.

102
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:47,664
It's also taken a toll,
like, on my health.

103
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,716
I have anxiety.

104
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,134
My chest is tightening.

105
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,803
Migraines, depression.

106
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:58,224
I constantly feel like
I'm having a panic attack

107
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,509
in my own house.

108
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:01,695
- Have you been to the doctor?
- Been to the doctor.

109
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,672
They don't know why I'm having it.

110
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,422
I'm getting my ass kicked, you know?

111
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:10,494
And I feel like I'm fighting
a battle I can't win.

112
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:15,565
Somebody's [Bleep] a
lot of [Bleep] pain.

113
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,819
I keep getting illness,
just constant illness.

114
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,170
Sick, sick, sick.

115
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,008
High blood pressure, cancer, migraines,

116
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,927
possibly, like, heart issues.

117
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:28,845
I feel sick to my stomach.

118
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,917
I'm feeling like that
creepy man is, like,

119
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,388
standing right behind me and,
like, breathing on my neck.

120
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,762
I don't usually get creeped
out, but I'm kind of creeped out.

121
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,755
So, Lisa, why'd you bring me in here?

122
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,158
This is my 4-year-old
daughter Jillian's room,

123
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,726
and she's had experiences.

124
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,127
Okay. Like what?

125
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,495
She was about a year and a half old.

126
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:07,299
And I was getting her
dressed, and the door opened.

127
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:10,469
And she turned and looked
at it and said, "Oh, no.

128
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,254
Not you again."

129
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,340
That was her first, like, full sentence.

130
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,291
What else has she experienced in here?

131
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,895
She has been pulled out of her bed.

132
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,180
So what happened?

133
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:26,685
She was asleep up here,
and she was out cold.

134
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,656
And then, there was this
loud bang and crying.

135
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,875
I come in.

136
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,243
Jillian's on the floor.

137
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,627
And there was, like,

138
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,582
these lines in the bed
like she had been pulled.

139
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,301
She had nightmares where
she jumps out of bed

140
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,318
or anything like that?

141
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,137
- Seizures?
- Mnh-mnh.

142
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,140
There's really no explanation.

143
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,010
This would kill me, as a
father, to have to hear this.

144
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,344
It's rough.

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,630
Your room is supposed to be
your spot, your safe zone,

146
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,815
your comfort zone.

147
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,318
Well, this kid's 4 years old, and
she's been through a lot already.

148
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,353
Is it affecting her in any way?

149
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,406
She just, like, gets, like,

150
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:09,094
these anger rages, like,
mood swings like a teenager.

151
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,131
I'm just pissed because I can't stop it.

152
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,599
You know, it's, like
You can't stop it.

153
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,651
You can't see it. You can't fight it.

154
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:25,226
I just hear crying,
crying... weeping, sobbing.

155
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,892
It's, like, in the walls.

156
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,795
Bad, bad little girl.

157
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:33,766
All the time, getting in
trouble, acting out, being bad.

158
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:39,305
Something's making
her do these things...

159
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:43,075
and I think she is possessed
by the dead little girl.

160
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,910
It's bad. It's really bad.

161
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:46,712
It's really bad.

162
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,817
The other living people
here think it's, um, like,

163
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,252
night terrors.

164
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:56,255
I don't know if they know
how dire it is, actually.

165
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,296
Well, Lisa, to be honest with you,

166
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,399
I was hoping you weren't
gonna take me into this room.

167
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,850
- This is Tori's room, right?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,802
This is your daughter
with Down syndrome.

169
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,187
Right.

170
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:13,355
So obviously, she's going
through something in here.

171
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,690
Definitely.

172
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:19,845
We've had toys that
go off by themselves.

173
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,215
She's mentioned that she has
seen a little girl in here

174
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,184
that plays with her toys.

175
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,802
Okay. Does anything else go on in here?

176
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:31,524
She has told me that
there is a big...

177
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,693
She calls him "the big, scary man."

178
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:40,433
And he stands here in
her room, and he yells.

179
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,601
Did she describe him to you?

180
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:45,271
It's kind of hard for her because,

181
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:49,508
like, unfortunately, mentally,
she's around like 3, 4.

182
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:50,045
Right. Okay.

183
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:54,047
And then, she also used
to have a chair in here.

184
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,316
There was a man that sat in the chair

185
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,434
and just watched her.

186
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,186
He's a friggin' coward, is what he is.

187
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:05,125
We would hear her at night
just screaming, you know,

188
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,461
"Stop. Shut up. Leave me alone."

189
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,597
Now, you're sure it wasn't
a nightmare she was having?

190
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,865
No, she was awake.

191
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,367
It's hard. It's gotten unbearable.

192
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,732
I don't even know what we're gonna do.

193
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,164
I need to know what I'm up against.

194
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,016
I need to know how to get rid of it.

195
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,524
I think this is the worst room.

196
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,067
I see a girl, older.

197
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,969
She's got, like, brown hair.

198
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:38,975
Creepy dead guy is... influencing her.

199
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:42,238
So we have the dead little girl

200
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,772
who's influencing that
person in that room...

201
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:52,377
and the dead creepy guy
who's influencing this girl.

202
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:58,240
I've never seen dead people,
two in the same place,

203
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,809
trying to [Bleep] possess kids.

204
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,797
I don't know. That
seems suspicious to me.

205
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:12,738
This one's way more influenced
than that one so far.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,373
She's way gone.

207
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:39,873
So why don't you tell me

208
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:41,341
about some of the
experiences you're having?

209
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:43,570
I don't really remember it,

210
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,341
but my mom told me that,
uh, I got up out of my bed.

211
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,210
And my eyes were pitch-black,

212
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,979
and I started attacking her.

213
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:56,514
I don't remember anything.

214
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,982
How old were you when this happened?

215
00:10:58,084 --> 00:10:59,217
12 or something.

216
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,702
You're 13 now?

217
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,120
Yeah, almost 14.

218
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,439
When you were awake, have
you ever attacked your mother?

219
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:05,690
No.

220
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,376
That's my mom. You would
never attack your mom.

221
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,561
- I mean, that's pretty strange.
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:11,896
Anything else?

223
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:15,349
One night in the summer,
I woke up freezing cold,

224
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,968
and I looked at my shirt,

225
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,937
and it was being pulled up like this.

226
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:23,558
And then, when I stared at it,
it just went down like that.

227
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:25,660
So it looked like something
was pulling on your shirt?

228
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:26,986
- Yeah.
- And you were freezing?

229
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,018
Were you sick?

230
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,819
Did you have a fever
or anything like that?

231
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,954
- No.
- Okay. Where were you?

232
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,455
- Top bunk.
- Top bunk.

233
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,591
Okay. Well, I got to tell you,

234
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,276
I've heard a lot of
stories doing what I do now.

235
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,861
This is pretty out there.

236
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,195
Yeah.

237
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,480
I mean, it's like something
you see in a movie.

238
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,733
If it's really happening,
you guys got a problem.

239
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,345
Bad. Ooh, it's so bad up there!

240
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,116
Bad physical attack.

241
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,784
It's all up there.

242
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,970
Nothing down here, though.

243
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,992
It's this creepy guy
yanking on their jaw.

244
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:18,002
Yeah, this is [Bleep] nuts.

245
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,878
So, Jennifer, I was talking to Lisa,

246
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,798
and she told me that
you were a skeptic...

247
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,750
- Yes.
- ...before you moved here.

248
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:33,918
Very much so.

249
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,820
Not anymore, though,
from what I understand.

250
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,121
- No.
- Okay.

251
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,456
So what changed your mind?

252
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,418
Well, one night, my brother
Daniel came to me in a dream.

253
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,235
- Your brother?
- Yes.

254
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,254
He told me I need to
get Lisa and these kids

255
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,788
out of this house.

256
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,891
Okay, so I'm assuming
your brother passed.

257
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,042
Yes.

258
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,060
What happened, if you
don't mind me asking?

259
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:56,999
He shot himself with
my grandfather's gun.

260
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,401
Okay. Uh, how long ago was that?

261
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,169
Well, it's been about 10 years.

262
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,338
I have a picture of him right here.

263
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:07,948
How old was he when he passed?

264
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,648
- 24, 25.
- All right.

265
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,300
- So he was young.
- He was young.

266
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,752
What kind of guy was he?

267
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:16,121
He would give the shirt
off his back for anybody

268
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:17,889
that he loved and cared about.

269
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,357
That had to be a tough loss.

270
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:20,525
Mm-hmm.

271
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,727
Lisa and him were friends.

272
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:25,230
- Is that right?
- That's how I knew who Lisa was.

273
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:28,900
She was the little girl
running around with my brother.

274
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,202
Okay. That's interesting.

275
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:31,720
So did he know the kids?

276
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:35,941
He knew the boys, and
Tori was just a baby.

277
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,142
Okay.

278
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,010
I believe he's here,

279
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,979
and I believe he's trying to protect us.

280
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:42,923
It sounds like he gave you a warning.

281
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,225
I believe so.

282
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:45,559
Would you like to get
the hell out of here?

283
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:46,744
- Yes.
- You would?

284
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:48,112
In a heartbeat.

285
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:58,005
I think that there's somebody here

286
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,841
related to these people, I think,

287
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,042
who live here,

288
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,946
who killed himself...
shot himself in the head.

289
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,719
I don't know if he did it here,

290
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,989
but he's attached to them
somehow, and he's here.

291
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:20,678
He's telling me that
this little girl, Casey,

292
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:24,498
is evil and not to be trusted.

293
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,849
He's concerned.

294
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,752
I think he's concerned
about somebody here.

295
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,243
He's trying to help, but he can't.

296
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:38,946
He's, like, trying to intervene.

297
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:42,750
But creepy guy...
he's got more power.

298
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,392
There's a lot of
activity that happens in here.

299
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:52,493
Okay. Tell me about some of it.

300
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:56,503
Well, I was laying in
the middle of the bed,

301
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,638
and Lisa was taking a hot shower.

302
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,440
All of a sudden, I just seen a shadow,

303
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:03,243
the steam coming out of the bathroom.

304
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:04,678
It walked down the hallway.

305
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,213
This shadow thing, did it
have an appearance of a human,

306
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:08,415
or was it just a blob?

307
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,017
It looked like, uh, I
guess like a tall man.

308
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,185
Okay.

309
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,154
Take the Marlboro man
and take his hat off.

310
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,739
You guys taking any kind of drugs that

311
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:17,407
are making you hallucinate a little bit?

312
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:20,477
No. I've seen it several
times in our house.

313
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:22,329
It comes and goes as it pleases.

314
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,898
That's interesting. Anything else?

315
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,233
Well, I was sleeping perfectly fine,

316
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,537
and something grabbed my chest
and started pulling on me.

317
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,322
And it lifted me up off the bed,

318
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,808
and it was pulling me off the bed.

319
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,626
And I kept fighting it and fighting it,

320
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,895
and I couldn't get it off me.

321
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,013
You sure it wasn't a dream?

322
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,297
No, it wasn't a dream.

323
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,401
Whatever it was stunk like death.

324
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,902
Awful smell.

325
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,121
I ended up passing out
from fighting it so hard.

326
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,757
I just kind of collapsed.

327
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,325
What happened to you the
next morning when you woke up?

328
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,961
I had scratches and bruises on my chest.

329
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,248
Did it happen again after that?

330
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:58,281
It came back to me
about two weeks later,

331
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,266
so I immediately asked,
"What's your name?"

332
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,686
And it said, "My name's
Demas," and it left.

333
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,271
- Demas?
- Demas.

334
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,890
I tried researching
it and looking it up,

335
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,558
and I couldn't find anything.

336
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,176
How do you stay here if
there's something like that?

337
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:13,496
'Cause I don't want to leave
her alone with the kids.

338
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:17,050
Abandoning somebody
you love is not right.

339
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,085
Okay.

340
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,226
Okay. So crazy guy likes this room.

341
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:31,531
He stomps around in
here, crawls on the bed.

342
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:34,751
I see him, like... jumping.

343
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,936
This big mother[bleep]
is jumping on their bed,

344
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,404
you know?

345
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:44,444
I feel like they feel, like,
this energy move through them.

346
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,246
He wants to hit them.

347
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,098
Only when there's two people in
the bed, he wants to hit them.

348
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,450
I don't know if they've noticed

349
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,653
if they sleep apart that they sleep,

350
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,689
but if they're together,
all hell breaks loose.

351
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,641
He doesn't like them.
He doesn't approve.

352
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:02,695
This, you know, is
repulsive. They're disgusting.

353
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,648
He says, "Those kinds of people just,

354
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,401
uh, need to be wiped from
the face of the earth."

355
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,843
I think that we're dealing with a demon.

356
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,828
Comes from outside,
and it comes through.

357
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,464
And I feel really dizzy, and I'm scared.

358
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:24,233
This thing is really powerful.

359
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,653
It's so angry, like, boom.

360
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:34,294
The dead people do whatever
the demon wants them to do.

361
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:37,664
So it's this demon that's
trying to possess the kids?

362
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,700
Yes.

363
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:54,628
As soon as I got to town,

364
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:55,927
I called a bunch of locals trying to see

365
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:57,795
if anyone could help me
out with my investigation.

366
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,348
A local archaeologist
just called back and said

367
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,434
one of the original owners of
Lisa and Jennifer's property

368
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,654
has a wild and tragic story
that ended in bloodshed.

369
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,436
So, Johnney, you mentioned on the phone,

370
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,555
one of the original owners
of my client's property

371
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,190
had an interesting story
I'm gonna want to hear about.

372
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,608
Who was he?

373
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,894
The original landowner was a
man by the name of Abner Jackson,

374
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:28,715
and he was a planter that came
to Texas originally from Georgia

375
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,618
and settled on this property.

376
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:35,405
But at the time, he didn't
actually own the property.

377
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,759
And through various
business deals, he was able

378
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:44,147
to mortgage this property
owned by someone else

379
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:48,585
to various people so that
he could acquire money

380
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:51,988
to actually buy the property
from the original landowner.

381
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,590
Okay. So this guy did a scam deal?

382
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:54,658
- Correct.
- Okay.

383
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,326
So we know this guy's a swindler.

384
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,994
Do you know anything else about him?

385
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,033
He married a wealthy
widow from South Carolina.

386
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:05,001
Her name was Margaret.

387
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,260
And Margaret and Abner
had five children.

388
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,676
Okay.

389
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:14,798
In 1857, things really begin
to become very interesting.

390
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:19,636
Margaret dies, and Abner
takes this opportunity

391
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:24,441
to bring the family
together and convinces them

392
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,994
that they should not take
their mother's inheritance.

393
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,896
So this guy swindled his kids, too?

394
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:34,718
Correct. By 1860, he has 285 slaves,

395
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:38,205
6,000 acres in three
different plantations,

396
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:41,375
which makes him the
second-largest slave owner

397
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,243
in the state of Texas.

398
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:46,964
In 1861, the Civil War starts.

399
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,133
The sons all go off to war,

400
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,935
and at the end of the year,

401
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,509
Abner Jackson comes down with malaria.

402
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,049
And he dies.

403
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,696
This demon... it
comes through the back,

404
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,214
and it'll come right in.

405
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,167
And I feel like there's
a lot of activity

406
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:09,822
that happens in this area
because of this kind of path

407
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,791
that this thing takes.

408
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:15,795
When it comes in from
outside, it's angry.

409
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,297
It's just like

410
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:21,367
Goes, "I'm gonna [Bleep]
tear your [Bleep] apart."

411
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,690
Oh, I don't feel good.

412
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,709
It doesn't want me to come out here.

413
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,178
It's like, "Don't you dare."

414
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,148
Doesn't want me to go
there because we'll find it,

415
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,819
and it feels very
threatened if we do that.

416
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,690
It goes after weaknesses,

417
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,909
whether it's physical
or emotional or mental.

418
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:50,529
It finds it, and that's
how it makes you weak.

419
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,435
I feel really sick and
weak right now, so...

420
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,408
So what happens to the
plantation after Abner dies?

421
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,279
The eldest son, John, gets
sick and returns from the war,

422
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:12,218
and he operates the plantations,
all three properties,

423
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,136
throughout the Civil War.

424
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,654
Okay. So what about the other sons?

425
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,925
Two of the sons died during the war.

426
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,124
Okay.

427
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,487
The third, George,
comes back after the war,

428
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:27,156
and he wants his share
of his inheritance.

429
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,669
John basically says, "Why
should I give you anything?"

430
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:30,301
Okay.

431
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:33,808
So they get into an argument
here on the plantation.

432
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:37,347
John gets really upset with George,

433
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:40,383
and he beats him with a whip.

434
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:45,788
George sues for his
share of the inheritance.

435
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:48,791
And he wins his case,

436
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,729
and he gets the Lake Jackson plantation.

437
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,896
So that means George gets the property

438
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:55,065
that my client's house now sits on.

439
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,233
That is correct.

440
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:57,934
Did they live in harmony
after that, or what?

441
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,503
No. No.

442
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:02,339
In 1867, this came to a head.

443
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,242
John came over to ask his brother

444
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,878
to come in to a business deal with him.

445
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,129
Okay.

446
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:12,282
And George said, "No. I
don't want to do that."

447
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,850
So they got into an argument.

448
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:15,018
Okay.

449
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,187
And John said,

450
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,307
"Then I'm gonna whip you just
like I whipped you before."

451
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,093
George loses it, pulls out a revolver,

452
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:26,863
and at point-blank range shoots
John in the chest six times.

453
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,715
He shoots him?

454
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:30,634
- Kills him.
- All right.

455
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,102
So did the shooting
actually happen right here

456
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:33,270
- on the property?
- Yes, sir.

457
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:34,437
It did.

458
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,808
George is indicted, but
he's never brought to trial.

459
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,411
He develops tuberculosis,
and he dies in Galveston.

460
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,796
How old was he when he died?

461
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:45,549
George was 29 years old when he died.

462
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:47,250
Like Cain and Abel.

463
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:51,154
Very much so.

464
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,890
Creepy guy... He's not good.

465
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,761
I think he killed
someone when he was alive.

466
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:00,897
I think he might have
killed several people.

467
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,836
Any idea when this was?

468
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:12,075
I think that he was
from a long time ago,

469
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:15,078
I think before these houses were built.

470
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:17,998
And he owned this property, this land.

471
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:22,819
And this is his property,
and what he says goes.

472
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,159

00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,497
So far, I know
my client's property

478
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,280
was home to hundreds of slaves

479
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:50,482
and was the site of
a brutal family fight

480
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,200
that ended in murder.

481
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:54,903
But I need to see if
there's anything else

482
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:57,072
that could help my case.

483
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:58,340
Searching through old records,

484
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,642
I find out after the
Jacksons sold the land,

485
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,094
it became a prison camp.

486
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,727
And the conditions there were terrible.

487
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,549
I'm on my way to meet with
a former corrections officer

488
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,535
who says that torture and
abuse were just the beginning

489
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,320
of the story.

490
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,893
So, Reginald, what'd you
find out about this prison camp?

491
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:24,362
Well, after the Civil War,

492
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:28,383
the state had to come up with
a way to get free labor back.

493
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:32,420
And they came up with
this ingenious idea

494
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:37,916
of using inmate labor as
another form of slave labor.

495
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:39,184
So it was like slavery all over again.

496
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:40,418
Exactly.

497
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:44,637
So in 1872, the Jackson
family lost their property.

498
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:45,636
Okay.

499
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:46,971
And at the same time,

500
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:50,157
it was a company called Ward and DeWitt.

501
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:52,743
And the state said "We
have these individuals,

502
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,666
and we need to farm them out."

503
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:55,781
And that's what they did.

504
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:59,901
They leased the prisoners from
this prison unit in Huntsville.

505
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,313
So I read that the abuse
was pretty bad there.

506
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:05,020
How bad did it get?

507
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,237
They beat them. They scald them.

508
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,438
They whooped them.

509
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,908
These guys were dying from
scurvies and malnutrition,

510
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:14,294
and it was just a terrible scene there.

511
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,680
Basically treated like animals.

512
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,181
Yes.

513
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,501
It got so bad that these guys
would cut their fingers off

514
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,653
to keep from having to work.

515
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,289
Some would cut the
tendons in their ankles

516
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,525
so that they wouldn't be able to walk.

517
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,702
Left hand chopped off
to the second joint.

518
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:33,236
Some even to the extreme of suicide.

519
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:34,554
Wow.

520
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:36,890
And when they would run, they
would be shot on the spot,

521
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:39,476
and they didn't have the
decency to a proper burial.

522
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,778
So they'd just turn over a little soil

523
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:43,280
and put the dead body in there.

524
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,699
And then, they continued
to move forward.

525
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:46,867
Okay, so I can assume

526
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:48,668
the property I'm
investigating has dead bodies

527
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:49,892
from during this time period.

528
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:51,758
No doubt.

529
00:25:55,964 --> 00:26:00,467
There's a man, like,
a man on the ground.

530
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:03,937
His ear... his
ear hurts so bad.

531
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,490
He worked nearby.

532
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:11,889
He had to wear a uniform of some kind.

533
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:13,891
Do you know what happened?

534
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:18,362
It's dark.

535
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:20,597
It's dirt and grass.

536
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:22,700
I think people were chasing.

537
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,341
He's very confused.

538
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:33,777
I think he got attacked.

539
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,262
Very, very painful death.

540
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:38,215
Very, very [Bleep] painful death.

541
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:39,717
He's dying. He's dying.

542
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:41,618
He's dying.

543
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:47,324
Ah!

544
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,659
Oh There's a neck thing.

545
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,861
Oh

546
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,805
During my walk, I saw
several disturbing scenes,

547
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,174
but the creepy guy
trying to posses the girl

548
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,510
in the green room had
me the most concerned.

549
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:09,380
There was a little
girl that was in the bed,

550
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:13,901
and there was this thing next to her.

551
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:17,855
It had big eyes, weird, bulging.

552
00:27:17,957 --> 00:27:20,808
And they were glowing, and its mouth

553
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:25,129
was all of these really
sharp, like, teeth.

554
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:30,918
Amy, is this what you saw?

555
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,855
Yes. That's what I saw.

556
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:59,375
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

557
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,008
we're ready to reveal our findings

558
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,061
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

559
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,064
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Lisa and Jennifer.

560
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:08,415
They live in this house together

561
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:11,151
and have been going through
a horrible time here.

562
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:12,987
But that's not why they called us in.

563
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:16,066
This is why they called us in.

564
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,099
They're raising four
beautiful kids here.

565
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:19,800
This is Gary Paul, who's 12.

566
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:21,536
This is Ayden, who's 13.

567
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:24,906
This is Victoria, who's
11, who has special needs.

568
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,475
This is Jillian, who's
an adorable 4-year-old.

569
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:28,910
These guys are desperate.

570
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,228
They think the kids are in danger

571
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:32,013
and have no idea how to fight it.

572
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,248
Oh, how long have you all lived here?

573
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,416
Five years.

574
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,852
When did you start
noticing the strange things?

575
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,620
Almost immediately.

576
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:41,289
Okay.

577
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:44,825
This was an extremely intense walk.

578
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,313
I actually was frightened several times,

579
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:54,151
and I very rarely get unnerved.

580
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:57,705
When I first arrived, I saw this male,

581
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,107
and he's a conscious dead person.

582
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:03,010
I thought perhaps there was
some kind of relationship

583
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:06,080
with somebody who's alive in the house.

584
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,249
I thought maybe in his 30s,

585
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:12,069
and I got that he killed himself
with a gunshot to the head.

586
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:18,009
He's concerned about
somebody in the house.

587
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:21,295
He's reliving his death over and over,

588
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:24,532
and he's aware of what's
going on around him.

589
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:26,450
And he's trying to help,

590
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:33,708
but he's very limited because
he is in a lot of physical pain.

591
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:37,078
And that makes it very
difficult for him to focus.

592
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,747
I was hoping we wouldn't have
to discuss this at the table,

593
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:42,500
but... Jennifer, if you don't mind,

594
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:45,486
would you tell Amy about your brother?

595
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:47,622
My brother committed suicide.

596
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:55,229
And... how I met Lisa
was through my brother.

597
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,081
They were best friends.

598
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:00,201
He came to me in a
dream not too long ago

599
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:04,739
and said I need to get Lisa
and the babies out of the house.

600
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:06,657
You know, we had our suspicions,

601
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:10,578
but it's just painful to
hear that he's not rested.

602
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:14,582
It's been... a long time,

603
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,218
and, you know, you just
want them to be at peace.

604
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:19,654
And to find out he's not...

605
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,708
It's very sad.

606
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:26,594
He'd give the shirt off
his back for anybody.

607
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,995
And he knew the kids.

608
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:30,264
He was a protector.

609
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,066
I want him to be at peace.

610
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:34,502
I don't want him suffering or hurting.

611
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,073
Anything else on your walk?

612
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:43,311
I encountered another dead male,

613
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:49,817
and I saw that he was
a very big problem here.

614
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:55,289
I was seeing, like, this weird
dual personality with him,

615
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:58,759
where it would be, like,
this is how he was in life.

616
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:04,899
And then, he would morph into
this really awful-looking,

617
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:10,004
creepy thing with these
teeth and these eyes.

618
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,239
The first location

619
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:17,528
that I saw there being incidents
was in the master bedroom.

620
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:20,031
He's looking at the bed, and he's like,

621
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:22,917
"I hate the people
who sleep in that bed."

622
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:27,188
He said, "What they're
doing is sick and disgusting.

623
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,122
Those kinds of people

624
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,955
need to be wiped away from
the face of the earth."

625
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,289
I felt that it's possible

626
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:37,309
that the living might feel his attacks

627
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,428
because he seems like a physical guy.

628
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:42,948
Might feel him jumping on the bed.

629
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,201
I was sleeping, and
something got on top of me

630
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,671
and was, like, like, on my chest.

631
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:51,073
- And I was trying to fight it.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:54,332
And then, I passed out,
but when I woke back up,

633
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,532
there were scratches and
bruises all over my chest.

634
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,616
Did it say anything?

635
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:59,802
It said, "My name's Demas."

636
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,772
And what other room'd
you see this guy attack?

637
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:08,944
The second place that I saw
physical attacks going on

638
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,497
was in the room with the bunk beds.

639
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:13,616
That's Ayden's room.

640
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:23,459
And what I saw in there was a
direct line from the nasty guy

641
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:25,895
to the person in the top bunk.

642
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,432
The creepy guy was trying to wake him up

643
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:33,385
by taking his hand and
putting it in his mouth

644
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:36,862
and, like, pulling on his jaw
and trying to make him talk.

645
00:32:36,962 --> 00:32:39,295
And it was... seemed
to be very direct,

646
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,811
like, attack on this person.

647
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:43,194
Tell Amy about the time
with Ayden where he woke up

648
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,376
and the shirt was being pulled.

649
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,161
He said that, like,

650
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,732
his shirt was being pulled
out, away from his body,

651
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:53,835
like somebody was pulling on it.

652
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:54,937
Didn't he black out and attack you?

653
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:56,088
He, all of a sudden,

654
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,098
had, like, this
outburst of, like, anger.

655
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:03,132
And he started hitting
me and kicking me.

656
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,102
I don't know what happened,

657
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:10,322
but that was not my son.

658
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:13,375
Now, this thing you saw...
was this a person at one time?

659
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,760
- Uh, yes.
- All right.

660
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,712
So who is this [Bleep] You
know anything about them?

661
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,363
He lived here a long time ago.

662
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,432
He owned all this land.

663
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,935
He was not a good man when he was alive

664
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,803
and that I did, in fact, see him,

665
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,506
like, kill a few people

666
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,508
when he was alive.

667
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,476
Well, it
reminds me of somebody

668
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:33,528
that actually was one
of the original owners

669
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:34,456
of the property.

670
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,649
Now, back in the 1840s,
a guy named Abner Jackson

671
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,601
settled onto the land with his family.

672
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,620
This is Abner.

673
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:43,923
Wow.

674
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,475
The thing was this wasn't his land.

675
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,245
What he did was he just settled
on it and pretended it was.

676
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:52,015
And then, he mortgaged
it to other people,

677
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,883
and with the money he got from them,

678
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:59,255
he winds up owning over
6,000 acres and 3 plantations,

679
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,397
285 slaves.

680
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,962
He was the second-largest owner
of slaves in Texas at the time.

681
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:07,930
1861, the war breaks out,

682
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:11,103
and Abner's four sons go off to war.

683
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:13,620
Now, about that time,

684
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:16,390
Abner dropped dead of
malaria within two days,

685
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:18,008
but he drops dead without a will.

686
00:34:18,094 --> 00:34:19,693
His oldest son, John, got sick,

687
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,245
and they released him
on medical discharge.

688
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:26,567
And he came back, took over, and
started running the plantation.

689
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,874
I got a map that'll give you
an idea what I'm talking about.

690
00:34:28,908 --> 00:34:32,260
Your house is right about here.

691
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,730
Plantation house was right about
here, where these marks are.

692
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,132
So it's very short distance.

693
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,002
During the war, two of
John's other brothers died.

694
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:42,937
One other brother, George,
survived and came home,

695
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,139
and he wanted a piece of the action.

696
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:46,507
John told him, "Forget about it.

697
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:47,675
You're not getting anything."

698
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,143
John got to the point where they started

699
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:50,811
a physical fight, and
he whipped his brother.

700
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:54,348
So George sues him, and he wins.

701
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:58,402
He gets the property you guys are on.

702
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:00,788
Little time later, John
decides, "Well, you know,

703
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:01,852
I got a business deal
for my brother, and I'm

704
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:04,319
gonna try to hook him into
going into business with me."

705
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:05,603
Comes over here with his horse,

706
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:08,123
gets into an argument with him
right in front of the house.

707
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:11,626
And George pulls out a gun
and shoots him six times

708
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:13,461
right in the chest,
kills his own brother.

709
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,363
Wow.

710
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,470
You think George could
be this creepy guy?

711
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:19,956
No. It's this guy.

712
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,661
I just want to know what
his deal is with Ayden.

713
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:27,480
He hates everyone.

714
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:38,191
The next thing that happened
was I went into the green room.

715
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:39,843
That's Tori's room.

716
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,912
I saw a living girl
sitting up in the bed.

717
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:46,216
That was another person
of interest for him,

718
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,652
and she had dark-brown hair.

719
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:53,440
He was trying to possess
her and take over her.

720
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:54,758
This seemed to me that

721
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:57,561
she's been influenced
pretty successfully by him.

722
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,246
That is pretty far along.

723
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:02,065
I thought that perhaps the
living would notice some changes

724
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,303
to her personality or behaviors.

725
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:10,090
The male that I met
earlier, your brother...

726
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:14,778
he was extremely present in that room,

727
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,913
trying to protect her,

728
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:19,375
but the creepy guy is
much stronger than him.

729
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,207
You look pretty pissed.

730
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:23,109
I am.

731
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:25,789
3:00 in the morning one night,

732
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,755
I heard her saying,

733
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:29,590
"Stop! Stop! Get off
me! You're hurting me!

734
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,641
You're hurting me!"

735
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,560
Didn't you tell me that she told you

736
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:34,362
it was a big, scary man in there?

737
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:38,699
She said he is a big, scary
man, and he yells all the time.

738
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:42,603
Hmm. I did do a sketch of what I saw.

739
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:43,871
This is kind of weird.

740
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:47,742
Oh, geez.

741
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,385
What the [Bleep]

742
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,055
That would be the scary monster
Jill and Tori are seeing.

743
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:04,025
No wonder our kids can't [Bleep] sleep.

744
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,660
- They don't sleep.
- 'Specially Tori.

745
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,261
You don't [Bleep] with my kids,

746
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:10,031
and this [Bleep] needs
to get out of our house.

747
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,335
I'm afraid to ask if
there was anything else.

748
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,537
- But is there?
- Yes, there was.

749
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,390
Then, I went into the pink bedroom,

750
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:21,143
and things were not any better in there.

751
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:23,378
So that's Jillian's room.

752
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:25,197
What I heard was crying,

753
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:28,049
weeping, and sobbing
from the living girl.

754
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,835
I was getting that the living

755
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,419
were thinking that
she was just being bad,

756
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:33,605
but she was really also being influenced

757
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,757
to act out.

758
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:38,810
And in her case, it's actually not him.

759
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,145
In her case,

760
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,834
it was a little girl, who
I met outside initially.

761
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:48,639
What was the reaction
to the little girl?

762
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,974
When she was younger,

763
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:53,327
she would say that there was
a little girl in a red dress...

764
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:55,529
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that played with her toys.

765
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,182
Wow.

766
00:37:58,267 --> 00:38:02,244
This living little girl was
feeling a loss of control.

767
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:04,913
She was very frightened.

768
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:06,648
She's been ripped out of that bed.

769
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:09,351
I mean, she's okay,
tucked in, sleeping good.

770
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,770
By the time I hit our bedroom door,

771
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,572
you hear thump.

772
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,524
Started screaming.

773
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,826
Something has ripped her
out of the bed, on the floor,

774
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:20,145
and it has happened more than once.

775
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,597
Oh, my gosh.

776
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,632
Okay.

777
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,706
My belief is that there
is some kind of devil here.

778
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:37,146
And it's been here for a very long time.

779
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,050
And it influenced the creepy guy,

780
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,407
more than likely when
he was still alive.

781
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:49,462
And it's feeding off
of him in his death.

782
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:52,096
Same with the little
girl, unfortunately.

783
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:54,699
And he's utilizing her soul

784
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:58,235
and taking on her appearance
and things of that nature.

785
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,973
Like, this is the frickin' devil.

786
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:08,946
I had a feeling that there was
a demonic or dark spirit here.

787
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:12,166
I felt it. I'll go down fighting.

788
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,420
You know, I will go to the
end of the world for my kids.

789
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,640
I will do whatever it takes.

790
00:39:35,798 --> 00:39:38,017
Now, I been doing this
a long time with Amy,

791
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,518
and when you guys were
telling me about the activity,

792
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,736
I had a funny feeling this
wasn't gonna be a good night.

793
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:45,523
But I never imagined this.

794
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:48,582
Now we know what you're up against.

795
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,684
Big question is, how do you fight it?

796
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:52,599
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

797
00:39:56,321 --> 00:40:01,057
Many, many people believe
that there are certain areas

798
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:08,098
across the world that have
these gateways to Hell.

799
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:15,605
Unfortunately, I think that
this is one of those places.

800
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:20,360
I think, unfortunately,

801
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:25,782
the best thing to do is to
get out and get out fast.

802
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:34,924
And it doesn't end there because
this thing has attached to you.

803
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:39,696
You guys need someone to
come and do an exorcism

804
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:42,098
on each one of you.

805
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,220
My worst nightmare just... came true.

806
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,621
Need to leave quickly.

807
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,558
And then, you cannot come back.

808
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:56,463
Don't even come back
to the frickin' area.

809
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,133
You need to save their souls.

810
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:05,655
That's the
worst-case scenario, period.

811
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:07,040
Amy's telling you you
got to get the frig out.

812
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,508
What're you gonna do?

813
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:10,760
Are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

814
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:13,963
- We're gone.
- Yeah, gone, like, tomorrow.

815
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:17,301
What about the exorcist part?

816
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,470
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's happening.

817
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:25,142
I'm sorry that it turned
out to be like this.

818
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,694
I honestly knew.

819
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:29,380
I'll do what I have to do...

820
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,932
For my kids.

821
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:35,953
The only way Lisa and
Jennifer can save their family

822
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,523
from this demon is to move
as far away as possible.

823
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,025
If they do that and get an exorcism

824
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:44,661
for every member of their family,

825
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,397
they should be able to
lead a peaceful life.
