1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,812
This land is bad.

2
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,782
I felt, like, a punch,
like something hit me.

3
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,268
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,987
Something is chanting to
me, giving me thoughts.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,123
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

6
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,291
I think she kind of is.

7
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,271
I'm surprised you didn't
run the hell out of here.

8
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:29,387
Where do you go?

9
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,257
I'm hearing, "I'm gonna
eat her for dinner.

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,497
I'm gonna eat her. I'm gonna eat her."

11
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,498
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,335
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:43,335
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,736
They're from hell.

15
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:45,838
I see dead people.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,105
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,874
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,776
They were setting people on fire,

19
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:51,910
burning them alive.

20
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,412
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,713
Her neck got broken.

22
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,683
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,685
I hear a gunshot.

24
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:01,253
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,888
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,723
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:05,924
Something's not right here.

28
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,794
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,962
It's not safe here.

30
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,063
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:12,631
Are any of them buried on the property?

32
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:13,765
They're all buried here.

33
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,235
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,270
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:19,671
Until the very end...

36
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:20,973
I can't do it no more.

37
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,008
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,877
Holy [bleep] look at this.

39
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,311
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:27,813
It does not have a happy ending.

41
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:30,115
Something kills people here.

42
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,595
I'm in Mayfield, Kentucky.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,631
It's a small city in the
southwestern part of the state.

44
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,034
I got a call from a
mother who was hysterical.

45
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,303
She thinks that whatever's in the house

46
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:54,888
is going after her two kids,

47
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:58,007
destroying her own health,
and ripping her family apart.

48
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,642
She told me she's tried everything

49
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,010
and that we're her last hope.

50
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,115
Before Amy arrives,

51
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,951
I clear the house of
any leading information,

52
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:11,121
removing family photos
and religious icons.

53
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,589
When I'm finished,

54
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,192
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

55
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:29,689
First thing that I saw was a hill.

56
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,508
There's a hill.

57
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,443
It starts to roll.

58
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,680
There are things inside it.

59
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,249
There's a lot of them.

60
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:43,820
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

61
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,727
The dead in here are, uh, scared.

62
00:02:53,365 --> 00:03:00,136
They know this land, and
they know that it is bad.

63
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,879
Well, Socorro, when
I talked to you on the phone,

64
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:10,947
you sounded really upset.

65
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,216
I am.

66
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:16,419
It's not safe here.
I'm afraid for my kids.

67
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,138
It's been very difficult.

68
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,206
Nobody should have to live like this.

69
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,591
No.

70
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:23,460
Honestly, I mean, you're our last hope.

71
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,730
Who exactly lives in the house, though?

72
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,315
Well, I have a photo here.

73
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,875
This is my husband, Tim.

74
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:36,312
This is our oldest daughter, Bianca.

75
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:37,349
She's 14.

76
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,572
And then, this is McKenzie,
our youngest. She's 8.

77
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,171
What year did you move in?

78
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:42,773
2006.

79
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,841
Now, if you can, just give me a list

80
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,727
of what's going on in the house.

81
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,078
There's been knocking.

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,914
There's been footsteps,

83
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:54,451
things moving on their
own, shadow figures.

84
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:55,552
Okay.

85
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,521
And now it seems to be getting violent.

86
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,589
I feel it's picking on the
girls and picking on myself.

87
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:02,275
McKenzie hasn't slept in her room

88
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,610
in the last 4 or 5 years.

89
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:05,912
She's been sleeping
with my husband and I.

90
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,714
No 8-year-old's supposed
to go through that.

91
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,099
Well, that can't be
great for the marriage.

92
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:11,168
It's taken a very big
toll on our marriage.

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,005
But at the same time, she's scared.

94
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:16,940
We're the parents. We're
supposed to protect them.

95
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,508
What about you? How are you holding up?

96
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:19,910
It's been very hard.

97
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,413
There's days where I just
think I'm going crazy.

98
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:27,617
I've also had medical
issues with my right leg.

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,587
I've been to the doctor's.
I've been to a specialist.

100
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,956
And nobody can seem to tell
me what's wrong with my leg.

101
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,958
Is that the only physical
problem you're having?

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,226
Other than my anxiety.

103
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,895
So when these anxiety
attacks happen, is it...

104
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:40,430
Explain what happens to you.

105
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,232
Almost like I can't
breathe and my chest hurts.

106
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,601
Something doesn't feel right,

107
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,903
almost like I'm crawling
out of my own skin.

108
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,256
It's just not normal.
I know it's not normal.

109
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,757
Well, we're here.

110
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,277
I just
hope you guys can help.

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,554
This is a bad room,

112
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,089
very bad.

113
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,258
Yeah. I see a man and a woman fighting.

114
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:09,693
She has, like, stomach...

115
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,963
bad stomach problems, heart issues.

116
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,499
Real sick. Really, really [bleep] sick.

117
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:19,169
Panic, anxiety, very depressed.

118
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,437
Ooh.

119
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,715
Oh, this is terrible. This is awful.

120
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:36,136
My God. This person has,
like, major anxiety issues.

121
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,388
There's this, like, overwhelming feeling

122
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:40,023
like she can't take it anymore.

123
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:45,195
Uh...

124
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,631
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

125
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,433
I think she kind of is.

126
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,501
Ooh.

127
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,971
Oh, my God.

128
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:57,541
Oh.

129
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,246
Okay. So why'd you
bring me in the kitchen?

130
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,516
In here, we hear a lot
of unexplained noise

131
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,535
that's coming out of
the kitchen area...

132
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:11,488
doors slamming, things
shuffling in the cabinets.

133
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:14,724
Now, do you actually see the
drawers opening and closing?

134
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,526
No. We don't.

135
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:18,962
Do you ever have evidence
that something's been moved?

136
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,297
No. We don't.

137
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,681
Anything else?

138
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,866
In the laundry room area,

139
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,769
I felt, like, a punch,
like something just hit me.

140
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,537
It was whew, right at the rib cage.

141
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,273
It knocked the wind out of me. Really?

142
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,442
And I've seen a shadow
figure at the door.

143
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:36,146
It's tall, dark, black male figure.

144
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,081
And it's there for a couple
seconds, and it's gone.

145
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,367
You got a lot of lights from cars

146
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,569
going by every once in a while.

147
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:43,920
What about that?

148
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,872
Could it cast a shadow on
anything you got in there?

149
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,258
No. I don't believe it does. No.

150
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:49,559
So this shadow figure you saw,

151
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,461
do you feel that this
thing is threatening?

152
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,129
Yes. I was scared.

153
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,798
Being stared at...

154
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,468
It's a stare that makes you
very, very uncomfortable.

155
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,504
I'm surprised you didn't
run the hell out of here.

156
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,305
Where do you go?

157
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,777
The living woman,

158
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:11,114
she sees the figures from outside,

159
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,150
from inside the earth.

160
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:17,237
Do you know what these things
would look like to people?

161
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,139
Like shadow people.

162
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:22,158
They're kind of tall, though.

163
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:25,462
They're around her a lot.

164
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:29,266
She's attracting them to her

165
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:35,772
because of what is happening
or has happened in her life.

166
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:41,411
Somehow, she knows that
there are these bad things,

167
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:44,648
so she's, like, inviting this evil in.

168
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,175
How long has McKenzie been
sleeping with you guys?

169
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,726
A little over 4 years.

170
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:58,862
It's a lot to deal with.

171
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:02,732
And it has taken a
strain on our marriage.

172
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,200
Okay.

173
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:05,869
You mentioned that you had
some stuff going on in here.

174
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,355
Yes. Um, I was lying in bed.

175
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,339
Okay.

176
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,442
And I saw a dark shadow figure

177
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,511
standing over my bed.

178
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:16,646
I closed my eyes
several times and prayed.

179
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,198
And opened my eyes,
and it's still there.

180
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,383
You... you're sure you
weren't dreaming, though?

181
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:21,534
No. I wasn't dreaming.

182
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,587
Did that ever happen again?

183
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,055
In the bathroom.

184
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:27,307
As I'm in there taking a shower,

185
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,626
I feel like I'm being stared at.

186
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:30,894
It's... it's horrible.

187
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,313
There's been another
incident just recently

188
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:35,031
that I'm laying in bed,

189
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,367
and I felt a tug on the blankets.

190
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,536
And McKenzie usually
tugs at the blankets

191
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,104
and then crawls into bed with us.

192
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:44,174
So I turned, thinking,
"Well, okay, McKenzie."

193
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,743
Well, McKenzie's not in bed with me.

194
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,745
What about the dogs? Do they ever...

195
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,347
No. They get kenneled at night.

196
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,731
I mean, how are you living like this?

197
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,350
I mean, just listening
to your stories is...

198
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:55,285
It's been very hard. It's
been very difficult, Steve.

199
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:58,421
I don't know what's here.

200
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:02,225
I know that whatever is
here, it's not a good thing.

201
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,798
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

202
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,670
They're all over.

203
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,338
They're all over in here.

204
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,443
She sees like two to four of them.

205
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,079
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

206
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:28,084
Subconsciously, she invited them in.

207
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:31,771
They're attracted to negative people.

208
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:35,525
So if the person is
having a really bad time

209
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:39,929
or they're depressed, they
see that as an invitation.

210
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,231
You know, it's almost kind of like

211
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,733
she's trying to sell her soul...

212
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:46,603
like she's trying to make a deal here.

213
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:47,937
For what?

214
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:52,375
She's saying she would
give up her eternal soul.

215
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,679
She doesn't really see another way out.

216
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,404
So, Tim, I talked to your
wife about what's going on here,

217
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,538
and things are pretty bad.

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,140
Yeah. And it's getting worse.

219
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,972
You got to be concerned
for your wife and daughters,

220
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:21,393
I would think.

221
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,943
Yeah. I am because my work
takes me out of town a lot.

222
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,212
And it's tough. It's tough leaving.

223
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,612
So, Tim, how is the
relationship with your wife?

224
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,949
It's not like it should be.

225
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:35,086
I mean, we both snap at each other.

226
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:38,689
The slightest little thing
just sets... sets us off.

227
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,325
So what about experiences for yourself?

228
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,526
Have you had any?

229
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:45,546
I went up and was tucking the girls in.

230
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay.

231
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,132
And just getting ready
to come down the stairs.

232
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:51,135
And next thing I know, my
feet are out from under me,

233
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,304
and I'm at the bottom of the stairs.

234
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:55,806
Did one foot slip? What
happened when you fell?

235
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:56,874
I don't fall.

236
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,425
I've never fell down stairs before.

237
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,377
You know, I'm...
I'm an iron worker.

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,413
Right. So for your
profession alone, you would...

239
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,215
you're not the type
that's just gonna fall.

240
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,549
Right.

241
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,184
Could've broke your neck. Yeah.

242
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:13,674
There's an old man down
here talking about a barn.

243
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:16,277
He lived here a long time ago,

244
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,695
a long, long time ago.

245
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:20,498
He walks through the kitchen wall.

246
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,334
He does pranks...

247
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,237
I think like making
people trip and fall.

248
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,873
I did see somebody tripping,
and he was laughing.

249
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,445
This guy, he's not good.

250
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,481
Uh, he's very, very abusive.

251
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,617
He doesn't give a [bleep]
what I think about him.

252
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:48,359
So, Bianca, I was
talking to Mom and Dad.

253
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:49,760
They're telling me

254
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,295
you're going through
some tough times here.

255
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,130
It's kind of hard, you know?

256
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,983
Like, you don't know
if you're sane or not.

257
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,969
You feel crazy. Feels
like you're in a dream.

258
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:00,337
I was talking to Mom,

259
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:02,823
and she was telling me
that her mood's changed.

260
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:03,941
Have you noticed that?

261
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:04,942
Yeah.

262
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:08,579
She's mad a lot, short-tempered.

263
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:12,216
It's... it happens to me.
I'll get extremely mad.

264
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:13,851
I think it's the thing that's here.

265
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:16,353
We used to be happy.

266
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:20,090
What are some of the
experiences you're having?

267
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:21,825
In the corners or on the wall,

268
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:25,196
it's this really dark, tall man figure.

269
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,381
But you can't see anything,
no face, no nothing,

270
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,415
just a black mist.

271
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,035
And how often do you see this, honey?

272
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,303
Every other week.

273
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:34,421
Is anything else going on with you?

274
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:35,973
I've had thoughts that aren't mine.

275
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,192
Something is chanting to
me, giving me thoughts like,

276
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,910
"I wasn't meant to be here."

277
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:40,911
Okay.

278
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,313
"I don't belong."

279
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:46,150
If you already know
it's not your thoughts,

280
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,685
you got this beat.

281
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,653
You know that, right?

282
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,621
Mm-hmm.

283
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,089
Now, is anything else happening?

284
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:55,209
I hear voices, growls.

285
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:56,393
Growls?

286
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,780
What kind of growls
are we talking about?

287
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,234
It was like a roar
but a really deep roar

288
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,704
and an animal and, like,
human mixed together.

289
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,639
It's... it
was scary.

290
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,808
How do you stay up here?

291
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,776
Lights. I always sleep with lights on.

292
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,561
Some nights, I don't sleep at all.

293
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,281
Now, do you want to stay
here, or do you want to move?

294
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,649
- I want to move.
- You do?

295
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:21,619
I do. I don't feel safe here.

296
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,554
Okay.

297
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:27,057
Ooh. There is a teenage boy.

298
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:29,059
It's crazy and out of control.

299
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,996
And I think he causes a lot of problems.

300
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,464
He's in here a lot.

301
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:35,399
He causes noise.

302
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,868
He's very noisy, very loud.

303
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,870
He does, like, growling.

304
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,342
I see an old woman.

305
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:49,280
And she's done... She's,
like, done good things

306
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,383
to, like, fake this living lady out

307
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:53,867
to trust her or something

308
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:58,756
but made her feel like
she's protecting her.

309
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:04,261
I think these kids are seeing [bleep]

310
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,263
She freaks them out.

311
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,549
Like, she, like, does creepy [bleep]

312
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,401
Maybe looks like a mist, maybe?

313
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,870
She goes to the bed a lot.

314
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,088
I think she's flo...

315
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:19,376
She's been seen over...
hovering over people.

316
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:21,679
That's [bleep] creepy.

317
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,855
So, McKenzie,
I was talking to Mom.

318
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,173
I was talking to Dad.

319
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,491
And they were saying

320
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,260
you were having some
tough things going on here

321
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:37,778
that you were...
things that scared you.

322
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:38,946
Mm-hmm.

323
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,264
And this is your room, right?

324
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,498
Yeah.

325
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,701
It's beautiful. I wish
I had a room like this.

326
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,703
But you don't sleep up here.

327
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:47,037
Never.

328
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,322
You're scared to be up here?

329
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,141
You are. Okay.

330
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:54,061
Are there things that happened
that you can tell me about

331
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:55,112
that scared you?

332
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,281
Well, one day, whenever I was sleeping

333
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:01,168
in my mom and dad's room,
I saw a black shadow.

334
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,287
And it was coming across the yard.

335
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:04,455
And that scared you?

336
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,857
You play up here?

337
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:07,941
Sometimes.

338
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,160
Okay. Are you alone when you do that?

339
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:12,046
No. Okay.

340
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:14,048
How come? Tell me.

341
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:18,102
Because I always feel like
someone's, like, watching me.

342
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,337
You do?

343
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,739
Okay.

344
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:26,477
The dead lady, she wants this one bad.

345
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,679
She wants this one very bad.

346
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:30,280
She didn't want me to come in here.

347
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,349
She just says weird [bleep]
like, "I'm gonna eat her,"

348
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,685
you know, "I'm gonna
eat her for dinner."

349
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:37,388
She, like, watches constantly this one.

350
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,256
Watches, watches, watches.

351
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:45,829
Follows everywhere, everywhere, watches.

352
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,315
Bad, bad.

353
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:52,403
I think she's influencing this person

354
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:54,738
or will influence this person.

355
00:15:54,874 --> 00:16:00,461
Whoever sleeps in here
the most is in trouble.

356
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,679
Very haunted person.

357
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:03,947
Very haunted.

358
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,450
Not even a [bleep] chance, man.

359
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:08,752
Not even a fighting chance.

360
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:23,777
Socorro and Tim

361
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,312
don't know a lot about
their property's history.

362
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,404
So I got on the phone and
called a bunch of locals.

363
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,940
A historian just got
back to me and told me

364
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,009
that one of the earliest
owners of my client's property

365
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:36,228
has a story I'm definitely
gonna want to hear about.

366
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:44,420
You mentioned on the phone

367
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:46,396
that previous owners
of my client's property

368
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:48,763
had a pretty tragic time there.

369
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,632
Who are these people?

370
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,018
Well, George and Agnes Wyatt
are the owners of the property.

371
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:57,072
They bought it in
1919 to farm tobacco on

372
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:59,571
with their only child, Virgil.

373
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,423
George and Agnes came from
very good farm families.

374
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,825
Here's a picture of
George in his mid-30s.

375
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,294
As you can see, he's a good, strong guy.

376
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,114
And Agnes came from a
very prominent family.

377
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,132
She was one of six children.

378
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:15,368
Her father was
very well-to-do

379
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,156
and was even elected city assessor.

380
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,421
Okay. So how did it go for them?

381
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,090
You mentioned the tragedy.
What's their story?

382
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,394
Well, in 1937, George
got very, very ill.

383
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:28,632
He was experiencing intense
pain in his upper-right abdomen,

384
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,935
nausea, vomiting, fever,

385
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,386
even jaundice,

386
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,639
the yellowing of the skin and the eyes.

387
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,874
They took him to the Mayfield hospital,

388
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,777
and he was diagnosed with
a gallbladder inflammation.

389
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:45,815
Two days after his surgery,
he died in his hospital bed.

390
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:49,786
It was not a painless way to go at all.

391
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:52,822
Okay. So as far as Agnes
goes, does she remarry?

392
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:53,990
What's the story?

393
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,141
She did not remarry.

394
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:58,628
She remained on the farm
by herself until she died.

395
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,932
Okay. So how soon after
George dies does she die?

396
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:02,983
Five years.

397
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:04,050
Five years?

398
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,354
She died in her own
bed on October 20, 1942.

399
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,839
She dies of the same
thing as her husband?

400
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:12,108
Same symptoms. Same diagnosis.

401
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:19,232
Okay.

402
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,051
The old woman,

403
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:24,137
she doesn't want me to
know anything about her.

404
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:31,428
Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.

405
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,899
This was prop... her
family's property.

406
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:40,337
Who is this [bleep] person?

407
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:46,076
A lot of money there.
A lot of money there.

408
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:49,379
She had siblings, lots of siblings,

409
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:51,248
something like five or six.

410
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,876
Okay. So I got to assume
Virgil's the only kid.

411
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:57,842
He gets the farm.

412
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:00,144
No. She cuts him out of the will.

413
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:03,998
When Agnes passed away in 1942,
and here's a copy of the will,

414
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,018
it says in the will that
Virgil doesn't get anything.

415
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,720
Why would she do that?

416
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,555
It would appear as though
she didn't trust him.

417
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:12,873
It sounds like she's a mean woman.

418
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,542
Yes. It does certainly seem as though

419
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,160
she could be a very spiteful person.

420
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,762
So why didn't she trust him?

421
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:19,764
He moved off the farm and
trained to become a machinist,

422
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,766
which is a very skilled profession.

423
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,900
Okay.

424
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:25,369
But he didn't hold
that job for very long.

425
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,538
And he ended up becoming a laborer

426
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,024
for the Kentucky Department of Highways,

427
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,495
which is a very big drop in income.

428
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:34,878
What do you think happened?

429
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:36,796
Well, that's the interesting thing.

430
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:37,931
There are indications

431
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:40,166
that he may have had
trouble with alcohol.

432
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:43,570
He ended up dying at the age of 62

433
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,905
from complications...

434
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,741
an enlarged liver and kidney failure,

435
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,444
which is indicative of alcoholism.

436
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:53,179
Okay.

437
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:59,352
The old lady doesn't
like the teenage boy.

438
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:02,555
She says he gets in the way.

439
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:07,360
She can't abide it.

440
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:08,861
She's mad.

441
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:12,515
Some kind of weird dynamic here.

442
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:15,018
Totally just [bleep]

443
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,271
The old man is laughing.

444
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:21,341
He's like, "Oh, you met the... upstairs."

445
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:23,743
He hates her, hates her.

446
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,246
Are you guys related
somehow? I don't know.

447
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:27,880
They knew her father.

448
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,049
He's saying, like, somebody
should've just, like,

449
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:32,252
[bleep] like, shot them
all, like, killed them all

450
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:34,487
because they were all, like, demented.

451
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:42,562

452
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,280
unexplained activity in your home,

453
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,033
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

Files!" to submit your story,

455
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:50,136
and we'll help if we can.

456
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,087
So far, I've got
a family living in fear

457
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:04,804
on a property that's
seen at least two deaths.

458
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:07,173
But I need to see

459
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:10,209
if there's anything else
that can help my case.

460
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,168
Searching through old records,

461
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,234
I find not one but
four men who were killed

462
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:18,505
while working on my client's property...

463
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:20,641
all by a single bolt of lightning.

464
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:25,261
I'm heading over to meet
with a local archivist

465
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,130
who said those men never had a chance.

466
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,555
Well, Nathan, thanks for
helping me out with my case,

467
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,274
but why out here in
the middle of nowhere?

468
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,843
Well, I wanted to bring you out
here to a working tobacco farm

469
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,061
to kind of give you a glimpse

470
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,080
of what your client's property
looked like at the time.

471
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,549
All right. So what's the
story with this accident?

472
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:47,634
On September 2, 1939,

473
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,187
seven farmers had been
out cutting tobacco.

474
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:52,956
And they were taking
it to a barn to hang it

475
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,425
when, all of a sudden,
a huge storm blew up.

476
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:58,695
It was one of the worst storms
that hit the area in the time.

477
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,597
And you can see here

478
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:03,650
massive flooding, power lines down.

479
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,386
A number of roofs were
blown off of buildings.

480
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:09,172
Pretty rough storm.

481
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,191
The lightning strikes
all seven of the men.

482
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,576
They all go down.

483
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,044
That's incredible.

484
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,847
Unfortunately, four of the men die.

485
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,349
Wow.

486
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:22,219
Did these guys even know it was coming?

487
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:23,704
I doubt that they had
any idea it was coming.

488
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:24,955
Okay.

489
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,757
Here's their death certificates here.

490
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,245
You had three women who
became widows that day

491
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:34,631
and two children who lost their fathers.

492
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,866
Geez. Horrible event.

493
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:37,834
So this is just bad luck.

494
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,202
Bad luck or something.

495
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,471
I don't know of anyone
that's been hit by lightning

496
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:42,589
here in Western Kentucky.

497
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,690
I lived here all my life.

498
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,619
These shadow people,

499
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:58,038
they're all over the place

500
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,924
but mostly stay in the ground.

501
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,960
It's almost like a burial.

502
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:15,138
There's something with the...
with the outside, with the land.

503
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,877
There's something wrong
here with the earth,

504
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:24,881
some kind of, like,
entities or something.

505
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,885
Like, I kind of want to
say it's kind of evil.

506
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,193
During my research,

507
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,728
I came across something
that caught my attention.

508
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:41,048
I traced the property deed
back more than 130 years

509
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,416
and couldn't believe

510
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,435
that the average person
stayed there less than three.

511
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,803
It just doesn't seem right.

512
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:48,572
I'm heading over to meet
with a local real estate agent

513
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,674
to see if this is as
strange as it sounds.

514
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,763
Now, Fred, when I
pulled the chain of title

515
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:01,996
on my client's property,

516
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:02,764
I couldn't believe what I saw.

517
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,748
There was 47 owners in 131 years.

518
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,883
You're a veteran real estate agent.

519
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:09,235
For that neighborhood,

520
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,738
is frequent turnover on
properties and homes common?

521
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:16,042
That is a lot of transactions
for any particular area

522
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,893
and this area for certain.

523
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:20,513
Most people that buy homes there,

524
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:22,681
they stay there for quite some time.

525
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,017
It's one of the better
and safer neighborhoods

526
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,002
of our whole county.

527
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,071
Now, when you looked
through the records here,

528
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,990
anything stand out?

529
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,826
There were some things
that popped out at me.

530
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,028
For instance, in 1919,

531
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:38,864
I noticed there were eight
different transactions

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,166
just in that one year.

533
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,735
Also, there was a lady that bought it

534
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:45,171
and only kept it for 10 days.

535
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:46,839
Wow.

536
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:49,442
When my chain of title search came in,

537
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:53,045
I saw all these transactions
when it was a tobacco farm.

538
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,597
But yet the turnovers continued

539
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,499
after my client's
house was built in '89.

540
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:59,201
They were already the fourth owners.

541
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:00,369
I just thought that to be odd.

542
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,954
Yeah. Well, no doubt about it.

543
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,322
So the property I'm investigating

544
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,024
has some unusual numbers attached to it.

545
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,125
Very much unusual.

546
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,227
Okay.

547
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,991
I encountered several
entities during my walk,

548
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:19,942
but the old woman
tormenting the living girl

549
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,643
had me the most concerned.

550
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:25,047
This old female,

551
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,767
her head was very narrow and long.

552
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:34,356
And she had long, gray hair.

553
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:41,597
And she was wrapped around
this young female child,

554
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:45,701
kind of, "I'm in control of this kid."

555
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,407
Okay. Is this what you saw?

556
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:56,478
Yes.

557
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:18,654
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

558
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:20,639
we're ready to reveal our findings

559
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:23,375
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

560
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:26,945
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Tim and Socorro.

561
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:29,598
Now, from the time they
moved into this house in 2006,

562
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:30,618
things were bad.

563
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:32,134
But things just kept getting worse.

564
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,221
The biggest worry they have is
their two beautiful daughters.

565
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,542
This is Bianca, who's 14,

566
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:41,560
and this is McKenzie, who just turned 8.

567
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:43,629
The kids don't feel
safe in their own home,

568
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,297
and it's killing the parents here.

569
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,000
The activity in the home
is tearing the family apart,

570
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:50,769
and we're their very last hope.

571
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,622
So now that Amy knows a little bit

572
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:55,074
about what's going
on in the family here,

573
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,742
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

574
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,397
There's a lot going on here,

575
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,816
and I'm gonna start off by discussing

576
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:07,153
the conscious dead
that I encountered here.

577
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:09,922
The first individual that I met

578
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:15,361
was an elderly male
over in the dining area.

579
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:16,812
He's in his 60s.

580
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:20,866
And I heard him talking
a lot about hi... a barn.

581
00:27:20,952 --> 00:27:24,303
I think he lived here a long time ago.

582
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:28,174
He seemed to be pretty
negative and pretty abusive.

583
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:33,012
And now, in death,
he's still very ornery.

584
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:35,130
Something he was telling me
is that when he feels like

585
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:37,166
somebody says or does something stupid,

586
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,185
he'll try to hit them.

587
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:40,519
And what he was telling me

588
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,488
was that he actually does hit people.

589
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,992
And one of his favorite
things to do is to trip people.

590
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:50,062
And if they fall down, he gets a laugh.

591
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:51,780
Yeah, I was standing
at the top of the stairs

592
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,065
and getting ready to come down.

593
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,034
And I go to take a step.

594
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,336
And the next thing I
know, both my feet are out.

595
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,338
I'm at the bottom of the stairs.

596
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,657
It freaked me out. You know?

597
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:03,108
Tim's an iron worker.

598
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:05,477
He's used to being on beams and high up.

599
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:07,680
- Balance is his life.
- Right.

600
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:09,598
A guy like this doesn't just trip.

601
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:10,699
No.

602
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,985
Now, you got punched in the back.

603
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,423
Yes. I was walking in
from the laundry room.

604
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:21,260
And as I turned and was
walking back into the kitchen,

605
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:22,895
I felt a punch.

606
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:24,396
It just knocked the wind out of me.

607
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:26,260
So this sounds like
something this guy would do?

608
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,735
Yeah. Both of those things
would be right up his alley.

609
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,025
The next person that I encountered

610
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,210
was a teenage male.

611
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:42,047
He was kind of a wild child.

612
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,300
He's kind of crazy and out of control.

613
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:48,051
Mostly, I saw him upstairs
in the larger bedroom.

614
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,085
He's very noisy, very loud.

615
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,821
He often makes growling noises as well.

616
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:56,324
It's driving the dead crazy.

617
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,426
This kid's driving
living people crazy, too.

618
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,744
Mm-hmm.

619
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,596
Explain to Amy how
Bianca hears the growling.

620
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,899
She's come running to me several times.

621
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,785
And Tim and I... And we heard it.

622
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,069
What does it sound like?

623
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:10,005
A dog. But it's not a dog.

624
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:11,673
Now, Bianca described it to me

625
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:15,026
as half animal, half possibly human.

626
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,177
Mm-hmm.

627
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,812
I'll never forget that sound.

628
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:25,437
The next individual
was an elderly female.

629
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,740
So hates the teenage boy.

630
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,058
Somehow, they're related.

631
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:32,527
She was also saying that he
gets in the way of everything.

632
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:37,866
I saw her in each of the
rooms upstairs specifically.

633
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:41,086
And she's causing trouble.
There's problems there.

634
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:45,573
I got that she lived here.

635
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:48,743
She had like six or more siblings

636
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:52,013
and that she had money.

637
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:54,149
That's interesting.
Could be a long shot,

638
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,710
but there's a woman who
lived on the property.

639
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,808
Her name was Agnes Wyatt.

640
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:59,242
Now, Agnes moved here in
1919 with her husband, George,

641
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:01,027
and their only son, Virgil.

642
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,513
And they came here to farm tobacco.

643
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,348
Now, this is George.

644
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:12,288
I have a photo of
Virgil I was able to get.

645
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,191
Agnes did come from a wealthy family.

646
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,327
She had six siblings.

647
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:19,379
There was a couple other
strange things about her.

648
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:23,099
In 1937, George dies
after gallbladder surgery.

649
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:26,703
Cholecystitis was what they called it.

650
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,939
Five years later,

651
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:31,841
Agnes dies of the same exact thing,

652
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:33,393
which I thought was odd.

653
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:37,547
Now, Amy, you mentioned

654
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:41,307
that the woman didn't
like the teenage boy.

655
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:45,075
Now, when Agnes died, she
cut her only son, Virgil,

656
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,727
out of the will because he was a drunk.

657
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,195
That's a lot of hate.

658
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,696
Yes.

659
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,398
Now, you said the woman
was trouble, though.

660
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,699
Yes. What does she do?

661
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:59,172
I think that she is possibly
a threat to the living.

662
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,675
When I went upstairs,

663
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,811
I saw her in the lavender bedroom.

664
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:08,665
And I saw her coming out of the closet,

665
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:13,987
being like a mist and,
like, hovering over the bed.

666
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:19,559
So the other thing was that
I saw an unusual relationship

667
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,145
between her and the person,
the female, in that room.

668
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:29,903
The female there felt like
this was somehow protecting her,

669
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,406
but it was actually making her sick.

670
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,775
That's Bianca's room.

671
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,543
- Bianca's room.
- Okay.

672
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,880
And is Bianca okay up there?

673
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,565
No. She's not.

674
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,816
She doesn't sleep.

675
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,885
She doesn't sleep
because something up there

676
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,187
doesn't let her sleep.

677
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:53,543
But then, I went into the pink room.

678
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,545
The old lady,

679
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,833
she's very fixated on
the child in that room.

680
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,736
She is always watching her,

681
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:06,406
tries to be around her
as much as possible,

682
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,041
watches her all the time.

683
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,543
And one of the things that she said

684
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,011
was that she wanted to eat her.

685
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,415
McKenzie will not sleep in her room.

686
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,885
She says that there's something
in her room that bothers her.

687
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:21,137
She feels like something
is watching her whenever...

688
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:23,840
Has she ever described
what she's seeing?

689
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,126
McKenzie won't talk
about it. It scares her.

690
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,261
She doesn't like for
us to talk about it.

691
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,714
She'll tell us, "You guys,
stop talking about it."

692
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,250
It just seemed to me like the old lady

693
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:39,239
had some kind of weird
obsession with McKenzie.

694
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:45,245
I think that it's her
energy that she's absorbing,

695
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:46,530
which can be...

696
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:50,217
have very detrimental
effects on her in her health.

697
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,268
I did a sketch

698
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,820
of what this old woman
is doing to McKenzie.

699
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:03,330
I'm sorry, guys, to even
show you this, but...

700
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:08,435
Wow.

701
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,587
It's no wonder she won't sleep up there.

702
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:11,838
That's scary.

703
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,345
I don't know.

704
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:22,716
Just so innocent, you know?

705
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:27,320
No kid should have to go through that.

706
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,935
I'm sorry, guys, to even
show you this, but...

707
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:48,473
Wow.

708
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,675
It's no wonder she won't sleep up there.

709
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,549
That's scary.

710
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,056
I don't know.

711
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:03,443
Just so innocent, you know?

712
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:08,065
No kid should have to go through that.

713
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:18,626
And that's what she sees

714
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:21,295
'cause she's told us she
sees something in her room.

715
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:29,704
I actually got a lot of
information on you guys.

716
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,873
The female of the house
was not in good shape

717
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:37,545
as far as just mentally and
emotionally and physically.

718
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:42,683
And I was seeing fights
with a male, a living male.

719
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:46,854
I got that you were very, very ill,

720
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,257
there were stomach issues, heart issues.

721
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:54,795
I experienced a lot of
different emotions...

722
00:34:54,897 --> 00:35:00,501
depression, anxiety, and
then feeling panic attacks.

723
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,570
Whoa.

724
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:05,206
I could feel all of
this pain and misery.

725
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,942
It was excruciating for me,

726
00:35:08,044 --> 00:35:10,344
and I got really dizzy from it

727
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,114
and, like, kind of fell to my knees.

728
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:14,949
Amy, you hit on just about...

729
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:16,283
Everything.

730
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,070
Everything that made Socorro call us.

731
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,738
I've had panic attacks, anxiety attacks.

732
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:24,141
She's woken me up because
she couldn't breathe.

733
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:26,844
You know, there's days where I feel like

734
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,430
I'm just crawling out of my own skin.

735
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:31,599
I am angry,

736
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:34,268
screaming and yelling
and just not myself.

737
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,903
Mm-hmm.

738
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:39,256
I feel as if I'm going crazy.

739
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:43,561
I've got medical issues that
can't be explained with my leg.

740
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:45,646
I've been to doctors and specialists,

741
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,681
and nobody can tell me what's wrong.

742
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:50,084
Now, you mentioned fighting.

743
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:51,352
Yes.

744
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:53,404
It's like I can't do
anything right, you know,

745
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:55,106
and she probably feels the same way.

746
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:57,958
And the girls don't
need to be seeing it.

747
00:35:58,044 --> 00:35:58,959
This is it.

748
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:00,511
You're our last hope.

749
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,230
Just to know, you know, what's going on

750
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:05,649
and I almost feel like, you know,

751
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:07,551
to prove to Tim that I'm not crazy.

752
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,070
Oh, no. Yeah.

753
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,738
I'm not crazy.
I... I...

754
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:12,957
Even though I feel like that a lot.

755
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:19,847
The last thing I feel very,
very concerned about...

756
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,568
What I saw was a hill,
and the ground was rolling.

757
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,121
And it was making me very nervous.

758
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:31,092
And I saw, like, through the earth.

759
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:34,695
And I saw, like, these little things.

760
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:36,697
They mostly stay in the ground.

761
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,033
And I got, like, some kind of burial

762
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:41,952
that they were, in fact, human once.

763
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:43,737
But now, they're, like,

764
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:47,641
these humanoid shadow creature things.

765
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,276
Mm-hmm.

766
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:52,680
And when I was in the master bedroom,

767
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:55,382
I saw that at least two to four of them

768
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:57,418
had started to surround you

769
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,740
and that you were or
had seen these things

770
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:06,060
or were and had felt them.

771
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:07,862
The thing about
these things...

772
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:11,715
They won't go to someone

773
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:16,303
unless that person is
in bad shape already.

774
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:21,258
So, like, if that person
is unhappy or stressed out

775
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:25,462
or in a negative situation,
they start to come.

776
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,248
You do see shadow people.

777
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:30,384
I see shadow people all the time.

778
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:32,086
Does that mean I'm doing it?

779
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:33,420
Not on purpose.

780
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:36,824
Well, when I go outside, I
feel like I'm being watched.

781
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:40,327
Oh, yeah. You're being
watched. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

782
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,947
In my bedroom,

783
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:45,299
I don't sleep with my back to the wall

784
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:47,401
because I feel
something's staring at me.

785
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:49,220
Is this something that can hurt me?

786
00:37:49,338 --> 00:37:50,337
Yes.

787
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:53,524
They could hurt your body.

788
00:37:53,643 --> 00:37:55,860
So make you sick.

789
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:59,847
The ones that are around you
now are always around you.

790
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:03,384
Are they around her right
now, these shadow things?

791
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:08,022
Yes.

792
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,858
They're over there.

793
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,993
Oh, my gosh.

794
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:14,778
Now, did you see anything else?

795
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:16,163
No.

796
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:18,115
So there's one other thing
I need to tell you about

797
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:19,283
'cause it's on your property.

798
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:21,752
Maybe somehow it's
related. I don't know.

799
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:24,438
Back in 1939, when
this was a tobacco farm,

800
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:27,841
there were seven guys working
out in the field right here,

801
00:38:27,944 --> 00:38:29,810
trying to get the crops
ready to get stored.

802
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:32,162
Well, a storm came through.

803
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,331
They tried to outrun the storm.

804
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,701
Lightning hit them.
All seven got struck.

805
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,920
Four of them died.

806
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:42,122
Their death certificates
here. Four guys.

807
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:43,457
Three wives became widows,

808
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,593
and two kids lost their father that day.

809
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:46,894
- Wow.
- Wow.

810
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:50,464
That's kind of crazy, actually.

811
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:51,849
Do you think these guys

812
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,567
could be the shadow people
you saw on the hills outside?

813
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:56,537
No. I think they go
back hundreds of years,

814
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:58,472
possibly Native Americans.

815
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:02,343
I don't think that
this land is very good.

816
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:08,888
Well, Socorro, when I spoke
to you and your family,

817
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,256
I knew things were bad.

818
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:13,692
But I didn't know it would be this bad.

819
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,928
And I'm sorry for that. I really am.

820
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,999
I know you guys have heard stuff
tonight that's really troubling.

821
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:21,600
But the big question is,

822
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:25,487
can you guys raise your
two daughters here in peace?

823
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:29,642
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

824
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:32,428
There's a lot of stuff
that you guys need to do.

825
00:39:32,546 --> 00:39:35,481
And the steps you need to take

826
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:38,867
need to happen relatively quickly.

827
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,616
So it's going to be intense.

828
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,169
First thing you're gonna do is

829
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:47,089
you're gonna contact a Reiki master.

830
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:49,381
This person will come in,

831
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,501
and they will remove all
of the negative energy

832
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:53,585
from the house.

833
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:54,837
And they will bring in

834
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:57,790
only positive, balanced,
harmonious energy

835
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:58,676
into the house.

836
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:01,177
It's very important in this situation

837
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:06,999
because the energy in
the house is so negative.

838
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:12,088
And your bodies are
encountering this negativity.

839
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,356
And when they do that cleansing,

840
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:17,476
they're going to remove
all negative attachments,

841
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:20,413
which means those...

842
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,564
- The shadow things.
- Yes.

843
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,399
And with McKenzie,

844
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:26,335
it'll remove the dead woman from her.

845
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:26,729
Oh.

846
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,486
So here's the key. You've got 24 hours.

847
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,047
They're gonna want to reattach.

848
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:42,739
So the next thing that needs
to be done within 24 hours...

849
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:46,876
I want the same Reiki master
to come back with a medium.

850
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:51,281
They're going to help move on
the dead that are in the house.

851
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:55,385
So then they're gone,
and y'all are balanced.

852
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,854
And the house is harmonious.

853
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,589
So after everything's done,

854
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,825
will McKenzie at least
sleep in her own room?

855
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,792
Yes.

856
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,761
- Oh.
- Yes.

857
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,380
When you came to us
to come do this case,

858
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:08,398
you were done.

859
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,667
I was at my breaking point.

860
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:12,702
But now, you've got a game plan.

861
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:15,255
And we've got a plan
and we know what to do.

862
00:41:15,374 --> 00:41:16,656
Are you gonna take her advice?

863
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,109
Yeah. For my family. I'd
do anything for my family.

864
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:20,443
All right. Good. I'm glad to hear that.

865
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,011
It's gonna be a family thing,

866
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:24,347
and I think it's gonna
not only bring us closer

867
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:25,849
but have closure...

868
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:26,933
Mm-hmm.

869
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,184
And start a new chapter.

870
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,522
I really feel for Socorro,

871
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:36,493
as the dead tormenting her
family present a serious danger.

872
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:39,496
But with the help of a
medium and a Reiki master,

873
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,298
they'll be able to rid
their home of the dead

874
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:45,001
and the negative energy surrounding it.
