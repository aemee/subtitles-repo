1
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:13,179
Why are there so many dead
bodies laying around here?

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,330
When I'm working, it
pushed me pretty good.

3
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:19,349
He's a slapper, a pincher, a hitter.

4
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,517
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,286
Out of Butte's beautiful history,

6
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:23,754
this is the black mark.

7
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,923
What is wrong with this [bleep] place?

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,293
I think there is
something very bad here.

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,728
There's problems, big problems.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,567
A bunch of perverted freaks.

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,570
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,705
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,707
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,275
They're from hell.

15
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:46,209
I see dead people.

16
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,477
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,246
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:52,282
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

19
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,784
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,085
Her neck got broken.

21
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:58,055
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,057
I hear a gunshot.

23
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,625
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:03,260
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:05,095
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:06,296
Something's not right here.

27
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:09,666
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:10,834
It's not safe here.

29
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:11,935
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,503
Are any of them buried on the property?

31
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,638
They're all buried here.

32
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,173
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,175
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,610
Until the very end...

35
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,911
I can't do it no more.

36
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,946
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,815
Holy [bleep] look at this.

38
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,283
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:27,751
It does not have a happy ending.

40
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:30,020
Something kills people here.

41
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,135
I'm out here in Butte.

42
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:48,172
It's an old mining town
in southwest Montana.

43
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,207
I got a call from a woman named Ginny

44
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,642
who sounded real shaken up.

45
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,878
A close friend brought an
old brothel called the Dumas

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,663
and restored it into a museum.

47
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,681
Now, she works there,

48
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,483
and she says that paranormal activity

49
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,151
has gotten violent and out of control.

50
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,953
She doesn't think it's safe to be there,

51
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,655
but she says her friend has
become obsessed and won't leave.

52
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,298
I hope Amy and I can help her out.

53
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:17,047
Before Amy
arrives, I clear the area

54
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,867
of anything that might
influence her findings.

55
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:23,887
This is a large space with a lot
of artwork and historical items

56
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,422
that need to be removed.

57
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,725
When I'm finished,

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,129
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

59
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,528
Oh, boy.

60
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:51,582
I walked in the door, and I
heard, "Get her out of here."

61
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:55,702
And the one who said, "Get
her out of here," is a male.

62
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,689
I feel like he was an owner.

63
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:03,761
He looks like he's from pretty far back,

64
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:07,331
but his presence is very here.

65
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:13,737
I think he kind of had his
hand in a lot of illegal things,

66
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:18,475
like I do see prostitutes around him.

67
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:24,181
I'm hearing "whore".

68
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,725
So, Ginny, I'm glad I'm here.

69
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,059
When we spoke on the phone,

70
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,494
you sounded really concerned
for your friend, Michael.

71
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,863
Yes, Michael is my best friend,

72
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,300
and he bought this brothel
about three years ago.

73
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:47,137
And he's become pretty
obsessed with the place.

74
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,405
Okay.

75
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:51,592
Now, he runs it as a
museum, you mentioned?

76
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:52,543
Yes.

77
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,044
It's a piece of Butte's history.

78
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,965
It was built in 1890 as a brothel.

79
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,932
Okay.

80
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:01,451
It ran for 92 years illegally,

81
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,654
and the sheriff shut it down in 1982.

82
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,522
Wow, okay. So, it ran for a long time.

83
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,523
It did.

84
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,969
They were gonna knock this down.

85
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,435
So, he saved it from the wrecking ball.

86
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,470
He did.

87
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,729
Okay, now, what is it that you do here?

88
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,162
I do history tours.

89
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,597
Okay.

90
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,286
Now, everybody's having
paranormal experiences here,

91
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,154
- or is it just Michael?
- Everybody.

92
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,675
People are hearing
footsteps, seeing apparitions,

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,827
and now things are getting violent.

94
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,079
Michael's had some experiences here

95
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,231
that I'm really concerned about.

96
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,151
He has been pushed by
something he cannot see.

97
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:36,804
His whole demeanor
changes being in here.

98
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,656
He gets all OCD.

99
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:43,711
He just, like, gets really
uptight about things in here.

100
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,597
You get him outside those doors,
he's a whole different guy.

101
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,384
It's a concern. It's a concern.

102
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,518
Wow.

103
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,253
What do you think is
going on in this place?

104
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,339
I think there's some
angry spirits in here,

105
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,890
possibly demonic,

106
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,943
and I don't think it likes Michael.

107
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,896
Okay.

108
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,403
There are quite
a few dead people here.

109
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:16,077
They are very physical
towards the living.

110
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:19,814
Beating them, molesting them,

111
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,013
um... influencing them.

112
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,791
How would they be influenced?

113
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:29,001
I think it might change their
behaviors and thought process,

114
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:32,403
and they might become, you
know, depressed, anxious.

115
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:37,841
Do weird [bleep] that
they don't normally do.

116
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:43,414
You know, that would be really bad.

117
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,288
This place is obviously creepy,

118
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,190
but why'd you bring me down here?

119
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,993
Because I've had a few
scary experiences down here.

120
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,094
Okay, like what?

121
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,496
I'll be doing a tour with some folks,

122
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,632
and I see shadows.

123
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,067
They're all over down here.

124
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,135
You can see out of
your peripheral vision,

125
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,121
they just run by you
really, really fast.

126
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,989
Are you sure it's not people on the tour

127
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,999
playing games with the
lights or something?

128
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,700
No, it's happened when I've
been down here by myself.

129
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:15,298
Okay. So, anything else?

130
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,818
I've had scratching and bruising

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,570
when I've left here from my tours.

132
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,455
One night, I literally had a scratch

133
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,906
down the middle of my back.

134
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,391
Not one, not two, but three

135
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:26,944
down the middle of my
back, and they burned.

136
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,898
I've had bruises on my arms
that look like fingerprints,

137
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,500
and I have no idea where they came from.

138
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,235
I know you called us for Michael,

139
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:37,421
but I think you need help
just as bad as he does.

140
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,673
I think there is
something very bad here.

141
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:42,109
I don't know what it is.

142
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,962
Hopefully, Amy can help us with that.

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,680
Okay.

144
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,489
The dead here are very capable
of interacting with the living.

145
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,791
It's, like, very direct.

146
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,228
Oh, there's so much.

147
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,097
Oh, my gosh.

148
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:10,292
The land owner guy, he likes
to keep people out of here.

149
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:13,411
Here he smothers the
[bleep] out of people.

150
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:21,586
God, I feel like I'm being
punched in the stomach.

151
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,890
It's horrible, like, it's awful.

152
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:28,109
So, sure as [bleep],
if people are down here,

153
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,675
there's problems.

154
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:30,810
Big problems.

155
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:38,918
It's good to finally meet you.

156
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,684
I've spoken with Ginny. She's
very concerned about you.

157
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:44,151
She used the word "obsessed"

158
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,485
to describe how you
feel about this place.

159
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:46,953
- Would you agree with that?
- Yeah.

160
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,239
Sometimes, it's kind
of like a time warp.

161
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:52,526
I might come here and plan
to be here until midnight,

162
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:55,162
and then it's 5:00 A.M.

163
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,463
I mean, maybe it's me, I don't know,

164
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:57,664
but you seem a little bit on edge to me.

165
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,866
If I met you at a bar down the block,

166
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:02,436
do you think your demeanor
would be different?

167
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,789
Yeah, I feel very
anxious sometimes in here.

168
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:07,507
I don't know what it is.

169
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,127
What does this building mean to you?

170
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,912
It's such an important landmark place.

171
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,132
It needs to be saved.

172
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:15,149
I don't look at it as being an owner.

173
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:18,385
To me, it's more of kind of stewardship.

174
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,638
It doesn't belong to me,

175
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:24,742
as much as it belongs
to Montana and Butte.

176
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,977
So, do you feel that you have
an obligation to this building?

177
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:27,845
Mm-hmm.

178
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,430
- You do?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:30,698
That's interesting.

180
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,801
Ginny mentioned that it's
gotten pretty violent.

181
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:34,868
Mm-hmm. Yes.

182
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,304
Here and to you in particular.

183
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,472
What happened?

184
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:42,209
She and I were in
here one night working.

185
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:47,247
I was pushed kind of like
a... more in the face,

186
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,950
it felt like, but it
pushed me pretty good.

187
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,152
She was right behind
me, and she just said,

188
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,321
"What the [bleep]
was that?" And then...

189
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,774
I think nine out of ten
people would have packed up

190
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,692
and [bleep] got out of
here, put it up for sale,

191
00:08:58,778 --> 00:08:59,526
to be honest with you.

192
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:02,296
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,464
Why don't you just give this place up?

194
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:09,169
I'm very attached to it. Unexplainably.

195
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,742
The land owner is mean.

196
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:18,071
He's a slapper, a pincher, a hitter.

197
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:21,023
If somebody he doesn't like is around,

198
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,022
he'll do it to them.

199
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:27,761
Do you know if
people might see this guy?

200
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:32,433
I think that they see a dark mist.

201
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,407
Oh, boy.

202
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,943
This is not good.

203
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:49,083
This place is not
healthy for living people.

204
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,855
Now, Ginny called us in 'cause
she was worried about Michael.

205
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:11,939
He's your partner.

206
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,088
How long you two guys been together?

207
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,687
We've been together for eight years.

208
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,881
Okay, and you guys owned
this place for three.

209
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:18,429
Yes.

210
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,522
So you know him pretty well.

211
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,257
How concerned are you for Mike?

212
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:25,878
I do have a pretty
strong concern for him.

213
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,549
His mood swings are really
bad since we bought it.

214
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:35,188
I've noticed he's more
obsessive-compulsive, agitated.

215
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:40,276
A lot of times, that
anger gets taken out on me.

216
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:41,594
Wow.

217
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,529
What do they say, you take
out stuff on the ones you love?

218
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:44,764
Yeah.

219
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:47,100
I've talked to Ginny.
I've talked to Michael.

220
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:48,968
People are having experiences here.

221
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,269
Now, what about yourself?

222
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,106
I was in one of the
rooms, and all of a sudden,

223
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,709
I felt this really warm
hand on my shoulder.

224
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:01,264
And then moments after I felt
the hand, along with the hand,

225
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:04,350
there was this really warm
breath going across my neck.

226
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,602
Would you say it was a man or
a woman's hand that touched you?

227
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:09,222
I would definitely say it was a woman's.

228
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:15,578
It was a lot more intimate,
almost sensual in a way.

229
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,263
You mean like a woman coming onto you?

230
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,614
Yeah.

231
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:24,671
There's a female who's very sexual.

232
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,974
What does she do?

233
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,709
She's hands-on.

234
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:31,912
I think she likes younger men.

235
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:34,331
If she finds somebody attractive,

236
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,017
she'll do stuff.

237
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,618
She's physical that way.

238
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:42,425
Travis, let me ask you a question

239
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:43,827
about the tours you do here.

240
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,586
Have you had any
complaints about anything?

241
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,519
From the customers
that have come through?

242
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:51,149
I've heard a wide variety
of different things.

243
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:55,868
People getting pinched,
their hair tugged repeatedly.

244
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:59,622
I've even seen people
go running out the door.

245
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,757
They get nauseated.

246
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:04,483
I've even seen a couple of
them, you know, throw up.

247
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,966
Now, obviously, you believe that

248
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:07,584
there's something supernatural here.

249
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,269
Oh, without a doubt.

250
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:13,523
I think there's numerous spirits here.

251
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,830
Oh, oh. Oh, boy.

252
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:25,302
I don't like... I
don't like upstairs.

253
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:28,605
Lots of anxiety up here.

254
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,075
Lots of anxiety, lots of stress.

255
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:36,246
Like, it's... it's
kind of making me sick.

256
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:38,532
It's like making my stomach upset.

257
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,750
I feel nauseous.

258
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,179
Ooh. My goodness. Oh, my.

259
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,187
Really, really, really bad.

260
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,570
So, Ron, I understand
that you've done some work

261
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,570
in the building restoring it.

262
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:57,988
- Yes.
- Okay.

263
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,189
Quite a bit.

264
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,324
Have you had any experiences
that you can't explain?

265
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:03,643
When I was working here,

266
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:06,696
I got the sense that
I was gonna get killed.

267
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:12,519
An evil presence, like,
telling me get out of here.

268
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:14,855
Really?

269
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,590
Has anything else happened to you?

270
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,025
My tools would end up missing,

271
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:21,411
and then I started
getting really scared.

272
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,698
The hair on the back of my neck come up.

273
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,433
And nobody's here messing with you?

274
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:27,467
No.

275
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:28,602
And you still come down here.

276
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:30,487
I won't come down no more by myself.

277
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,897
- You don't?
- Nope.

278
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:32,713
Now, Ron, you don't strike me

279
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,196
as the type of guy that scares too easy.

280
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,197
Not too easy.

281
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,281
I was a boxer

282
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,718
and hard brick layer, a concrete man.

283
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,570
I'm not scared of much.

284
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:44,072
But this place seems to spook you out.

285
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:47,309
Yes, it's... it's
dangerous down here.

286
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,543
I honestly believe that.

287
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,612
Okay.

288
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,016
And then there's another lady.

289
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:59,406
She likes to torture people,
but she is one to move things.

290
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,874
Open and close doors, move
objects, [bleep] like that.

291
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,527
Can you describe her?

292
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:10,029
Her skin is like tree bark,

293
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:14,783
and her arms are twisted
like the roots of a tree.

294
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:17,903
But it's so weird how
each of these dead people

295
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,289
has very specific, physical things

296
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,208
that they do with the living.

297
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:25,528
It's almost like they've had
a dialogue, and they're, like,

298
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,429
"Well, I do this, so don't you dare."

299
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,932
What would all this
mean for the living here?

300
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:37,089
They would be, you know,
toys for the dead people.

301
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:55,315
Look, it doesn't take a
homicide detective to figure out

302
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:56,483
what my first move is here,

303
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,602
especially since Michael
and Travis's building

304
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,070
used to be a brothel.

305
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:02,773
I'm heading back to the Dumas
to meet with a local historian

306
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,075
who said life there was
everything you would expect

307
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,109
and worse.

308
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
Let's start from the beginning.

309
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:19,088
Who built this building and when?

310
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:22,926
The building was actually built
by Arthur and Joseph Nadeau.

311
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:25,995
This is a photograph of Joseph.

312
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,653
The brothers built
this building in 1890,

313
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,053
and they also built
other red-light properties

314
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,255
here in the district.

315
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,223
So, these guys were
pretty smart businessmen.

316
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,175
They were very well-educated brothers,

317
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:40,594
yes, and they were very wealthy.

318
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,812
Okay.

319
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,064
But the Nadeau brothers
apparently kind of separated.

320
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,766
We really don't know why.

321
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:48,202
And Joseph stayed around
and ran the business.

322
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:49,670
Okay.

323
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,548
So, now, what about Joseph?
Whatever happened to him?

324
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,635
Well, Joseph died in 1925 here in Butte.

325
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,503
Okay, now, how old was Joe when he died?

326
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,704
He was 77.

327
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,745
This guy, he's gonna
cause some [bleep] problems.

328
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,114
I've seen a lot of dead
people in this place,

329
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,683
but my biggest concern is the land owner

330
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,185
who attacks the living,

331
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,037
and I'm trying to get a
look into who he was in life.

332
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:20,159
He's super negative
and extremely greedy.

333
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:24,197
Like, disgustingly greedy.

334
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,817
Do you know what his
connection here might be?

335
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,553
I think he might have owned the land

336
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:33,406
and potentially built this building.

337
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,358
Can you describe him more?

338
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,491
He's very well educated and wealthy.

339
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,224
White hair, pal skin,

340
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:44,463
and I heard 1900 and 1901 for him.

341
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:47,599
There was a lot of movement
in here, a lot of traffic,

342
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,769
which benefited him with what he did.

343
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,471
He is really nasty.

344
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,843
The Nadeau
brothers opened this place

345
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,178
as a very high-end brothel.

346
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:01,229
Okay.

347
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,965
Very exclusive clients would come here

348
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:08,147
and spend as much as $1,000
a night on entertainment.

349
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,212
So, the girls who worked
here were pretty high-end?

350
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,795
They were very, very high-end girls.

351
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,240
They were supposedly
very, very beautiful.

352
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,407
You know, Ellen, I was down
in that basement yesterday,

353
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,775
and I got to be honest with you.

354
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:19,210
It didn't look too high end to me.

355
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:21,499
Yeah, it wasn't too high end.

356
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,098
You know, here's what happened.

357
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,001
The copper kings left Butte in 1900,

358
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,938
and so the business had to adjust.

359
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:32,308
The upper floor catered
to the upper class.

360
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,011
The ground floor catered
to more of a business class,

361
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:40,082
and the basement catered to
the miners and the laborers.

362
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,151
So, I got to imagine, just
looking at that basement,

363
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:43,819
the conditions had to be
really bad for these girls.

364
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,155
It probably wasn't a
pleasant place to work,

365
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,708
and the women charged
50 cents a customer

366
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:54,179
and maybe would service
50 men during a work shift.

367
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:56,465
The mines operated 24 hours a day,

368
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,033
and so did the women.

369
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,002
These miners had to be rough customers.

370
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,971
It was a really dangerous undertaking.

371
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:06,008
There was violence. There was addiction.

372
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,711
Alcohol, laudanum, opium.

373
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,214
There was the danger of pregnancy.

374
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,167
- It was a dangerous business.
- Right.

375
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:17,252
- There's no question about that.
- Wow.

376
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:21,991
Nothing is legitimate.

377
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:23,826
They all have perversions.

378
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,462
They're dirty, and they're angry,

379
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,333
so a bunch of perverted freaks.

380
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:36,789
I feel like there was a
lot of drugs and alcohol.

381
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:44,913
Like opium, like hash,
like marijuana, cocaine.

382
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,751
I see a lot of, like,
people laying down here.

383
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:50,719
Like, just laying around.

384
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:51,654
How many?

385
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,055
A lot.

386
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
I did hear mining.

387
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,729
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

388
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:05,467
I'm trying not to be negative,
but it's kind of impossible here

389
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,904
because this is not a good place.

390
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,490
This is a cycle. This is a cycle.

391
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,474
What?

392
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:19,365
Anybody who rents
maybe or buys this place

393
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:22,885
is not on the up-and-up.

394
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,687
I'm, like, what is wrong
with this [bleep] place?

395
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,508
If you need us to investigate

396
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,226
unexplained activity in your home,

397
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:37,112
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

398
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,014
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

399
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,403
and we'll help if we can.

400
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,452
So far, I've got clients

401
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,288
who've been physically
assaulted on a property

402
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,623
that used to be ground
zero for sex and violence.

403
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,694
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

404
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,329
Digging through the archives,

405
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,182
I find a woman named Gertrude Pitkanen.

406
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,368
Turns out, she was charged with
three counts of manslaughter

407
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,037
after performing illegal abortions

408
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,372
in Butte's red-light district.

409
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,759
So, I made some calls, and it turns out,

410
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,629
it's very likely that
prostitutes from the Dumas

411
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,898
ended up going to this
illegal abortion doctor.

412
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

413
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,035
who says that this case
takes an even darker

414
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,687
and more horrifying twist.

415
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:34,232
So, what can you
tell me about this woman?

416
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:38,402
Her name was Gertrude Pitkanen.
Locals called her Gertie.

417
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,839
She ran a back-alley abortion clinic.

418
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,292
Now, would she have ever
done abortions at the Dumas?

419
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,543
Sure, absolutely.

420
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,229
Ladies that worked at the Dumas Brothel,

421
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,098
they got pregnant, they
didn't have a lot of options.

422
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,633
If you were pregnant,

423
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,285
and you were showing,
you were out of business.

424
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,073
But one of their best
options was Gertie.

425
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,592
- I read she got charged three times.
- Yes.

426
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,060
- What was the story behind that?
- Three charges.

427
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:08,716
Manslaughter, all three of
them, between 1929 and 1939.

428
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,969
Because of botched abortions.

429
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:15,273
The gals that she
performed the abortion on

430
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,692
died directly because of her services.

431
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,912
Here's their death certificates.

432
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,614
All right, so what was the
outcomes of these trials?

433
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,665
All three of those charges
were thrown out of court

434
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:27,964
due to a lack of evidence.

435
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:30,367
On the phone, you had mentioned

436
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:33,136
that this story had a dark turn to it.

437
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,771
I mean, how much darker could it get?

438
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,682
Pretty dark.

439
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,882
Some of these young mothers,
not wanting an abortion,

440
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,602
wanting to go full-term, were told

441
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,655
right after they had given
birth that the babies had died

442
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,090
when they actually hadn't.

443
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:47,959
They would be taken out the back door.

444
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:51,162
In some cases, with the
placenta still attached.

445
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:54,199
And Gertie would turn
around and sell those babies

446
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,467
on the black market.

447
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,738
14 we know of, possibly up to 28.

448
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,590
Going rate was about 500 bucks.

449
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,926
All right, so she's a piece
of [bleep] for doing this.

450
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:05,944
Yes, yes.

451
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,779
Out of Butte's beautiful history,

452
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,080
this is the black mark.

453
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,653
Why are there so many [bleep]
dead bodies laying around here?

454
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:19,824
How many?

455
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,526
A lot.

456
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:25,797
Majority men, but there are women,

457
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:28,900
and there are children, okay.

458
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm seeing, like, a lot of kids.

459
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,563
Too many kids for one family.

460
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:41,649
It's almost like a daycare.

461
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,300
And something about these children,

462
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:45,102
like, they didn't have parents.

463
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:50,207
So, I almost wonder if they
were, like, selling these kids?

464
00:22:55,982 --> 00:23:01,085
Like, drug dealers and
children sellers and pimps.

465
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,219
Oh, my God.

466
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:06,707
You got a brothel catering to
some pretty tough customers,

467
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:07,791
so I got to think, there had to be

468
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:09,043
a couple of homicides in there.

469
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,328
I called the Butte sheriff
who did some digging,

470
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,314
and he came up with
two suspicious deaths

471
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,448
that may help my case.

472
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,329
Sheriff, why did you want to meet here?

473
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:27,022
Well, this is the old city jail

474
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,907
where anybody who was
arrested in the area,

475
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:30,909
the red-light district,
would likely have come

476
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,346
had they been arrested.

477
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:33,945
Okay, now, you mentioned on the phone,

478
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,198
there were two suspicious
deaths connected to the Dumas.

479
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,949
Let's start with the first one.

480
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,184
Elinor Knott.

481
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,353
She was the madame at the Dumas Brothel

482
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,389
from 1950 to 1955 when she passed away.

483
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,807
Okay.

484
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:49,361
Her body was found on the second
floor of the Dumas Brothel.

485
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:53,031
I have Elinor's death
certificate right here.

486
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:56,134
It lists coronary occlusion
as the cause of her death.

487
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,236
Her heart disease had
progressed to where it was fatal.

488
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:00,339
She was young, though, 42.

489
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:03,392
She is relatively young to
have that kind of heart disease.

490
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:05,610
So, why was that
suspicious, do you think?

491
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,713
There was a woman named Bonita Farren

492
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:10,682
who took over as the
madame of the Dumas Brothel

493
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,452
after Elinor Knott passed away.

494
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,237
And there was a rumor that

495
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:18,290
Bonita may have had something
to do with Elinor Knott's death

496
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:19,958
so she could take over the brothel.

497
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,060
Now, you mentioned there was
a second suspicious death.

498
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:22,928
What was that?

499
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:24,229
Yeah, the second death

500
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,032
is Bonita Farren's husband, John Farren.

501
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,484
I have John Farren's death
certificate right here.

502
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,819
Cerebral hemorrhage.

503
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:33,271
Yeah, it appears that he
had fallen down the stairs,

504
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,640
and he was discovered at
the bottom of a staircase

505
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,159
near the rear of the brothel.

506
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,211
Yeah, I know that staircase pretty well.

507
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,912
That's quite a flight of stairs.

508
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:43,698
The doctor who signed the
death certificate believed

509
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:46,084
that alcohol was a contributing
factor to his death.

510
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,787
And it kind of connected
in a way, too, because...

511
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,806
Yeah, the link being Bonita Farren, yes.

512
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,474
Okay.

513
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:00,566
During my walk, I
encountered a very sexual woman.

514
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,835
I'm meeting with a
sketch artist to describe

515
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,337
what I saw her doing to a living male.

516
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,307
A male was laying in the bed,

517
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,780
and a female was
caressing the male's chest.

518
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:20,486
She had big brown eyes and
delicate facial features.

519
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:23,989
And she was kind of
standing beside the bed

520
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:27,459
looking down and touching him.

521
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:28,527
Is that what you saw?

522
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:31,497
Yes, that's what I saw.

523
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:52,470
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

524
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,737
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

525
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,973
and our clients for the first time.

526
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,275
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Michael and Travis.

527
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:03,912
Now, these guys are partners
in life and in business.

528
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:07,199
They bought this historic
building about three years ago,

529
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:09,952
but they feel like something
doesn't want them here.

530
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,438
But they're not the
ones that called us in.

531
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,169
This is Ginny. That's
Michael's best friend.

532
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,516
She also works here as a tour guide.

533
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:19,052
She believes that whatever's
here is changing Michael,

534
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,888
and she's worried that
he might be in danger.

535
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,923
So, now that Amy knows
a little bit about

536
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:25,525
what's going on with you guys,

537
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,827
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

538
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,965
When I first walked in the door,

539
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,934
I heard a male say, "Get out of here."

540
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:38,805
And I heard a woman call out, "whore".

541
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:42,942
I immediately got that
there was a lot of alcohol,

542
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:47,447
and then somebody was talking
about specific drug usage here.

543
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:50,333
Opium, hash, marijuana, and cocaine.

544
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:53,253
Well, let me tell you a
little bit about the building.

545
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:54,954
We're smack in the
middle of what used to be

546
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,840
Butte's red-light district.

547
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:01,978
This building operated as
a brothel from 1890 to 1982.

548
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:05,298
And there were competing
brothels all around this area.

549
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,735
I managed to track
down a couple of photos

550
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,071
from what used to be
behind this building here.

551
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:15,809
Now, as you can imagine, the
conditions for these women

552
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:17,827
had to be really bad, and
a lot of them turned to

553
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:20,363
alcohol and drugs, including opium.

554
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:23,756
Now, back in '82, the Dumas Brothel

555
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:26,490
was shut down and
neglected for a long time.

556
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,292
Michael stepped in, and he saved it.

557
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:30,727
Now, he's been renovating it

558
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:33,764
and turning it into
an historical museum.

559
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:37,718
Sometimes I think it's crazy.

560
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:43,247
We've put ourselves into
debt to try and restore it.

561
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:47,704
I don't know why. I
don't know what drew me.

562
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,805
I fell in love with
it when I entered it.

563
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:54,459
I felt that if someone
didn't step up to the plate

564
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:57,395
to take it over, it
would cease to exist.

565
00:27:57,514 --> 00:28:00,148
Interesting.

566
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:08,140
The basement was extremely active.

567
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,893
Going down there, it's like shocking.

568
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:14,563
The majority of the people
I saw down there were men.

569
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:20,435
They seemed to have
interesting sexual proclivities.

570
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:22,838
They were all, like,
doing dirty business

571
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,022
and stuff like that.

572
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,341
I heard somebody talking about mining.

573
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:31,547
And then I was getting
punched. Punched in the stomach.

574
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,032
It's interesting you
talk about the basement.

575
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,001
Nobody likes the basement at all.

576
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:39,254
And Ginny, tell her how you
feel like when you're down there,

577
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:40,917
it's like a terrible feeling for you.

578
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:42,433
All the time, I
feel like I'm being watched.

579
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,119
In fact, I was chased up the stairs,

580
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,188
and I don't know what
I was being chased by.

581
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,159
Well, let me explain
why you might have seen

582
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,860
some of those things in the basement.

583
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,430
Each level of the Dumas catered
to a different clientele.

584
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,366
Top floor was for the high echelon.

585
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:02,170
The main floor was, you
know, middle-class-type guys.

586
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,572
But the basement was for the miners.

587
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:07,108
Now, it was a nasty place.

588
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:08,676
From what I was told, from an expert,

589
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:10,962
they would service up
to maybe 50 guys a day.

590
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:19,804
The other thing that I saw down
there was a lot of children.

591
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:23,223
They weren't particularly cared for,

592
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,458
so I'm thinking they
didn't have parents.

593
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,711
Then I ran into this guy.

594
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,748
He was definitely like
a pimp and a drug runner,

595
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:36,736
and I was feeling like maybe
he also sold the children.

596
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:38,605
That's interesting.

597
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,207
From the 1920s through the 1950s,

598
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:46,112
a woman named Gertie Pitkanen
and her husband, Gustavus,

599
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,881
ran what they called a maternity clinic

600
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,415
a couple blocks from here.

601
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,017
What she really ran
was an abortion clinic.

602
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,987
Now, if a prostitute got
pregnant here at the Dumas,

603
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,205
you know, they had two choices.

604
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:56,523
Either get an abortion,
or you're out of work.

605
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:57,574
Okay.

606
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,542
Now, Gertie Pitkanen was performing

607
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:02,478
these back-alley abortions,
and they were very dangerous.

608
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:04,280
Over a 10-year period,

609
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,999
she wound up getting
charged three different times

610
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,400
for manslaughter.

611
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,385
I actually was able to get a
hold of the death certificates

612
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:11,738
here of three young ladies who died

613
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:14,951
as a result of botched abortions.

614
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:16,133
Oh, my goodness.

615
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:18,335
But she was never convicted.

616
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:21,856
Now, you mentioned
something about selling kids.

617
00:30:21,975 --> 00:30:23,007
Yes.

618
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:27,945
Gertie, on at least 14
documented occasions,

619
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:31,783
was telling mothers that
their babies were stillborn

620
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:34,152
and then taking those
babies that were alive

621
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:36,587
and selling them for
$500 on the black market.

622
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:38,523
Wow.

623
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,258
They're known as Gertie's babies.

624
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,600
I met two women in here.

625
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:54,071
The first one I encountered
in one of the bedrooms,

626
00:30:54,174 --> 00:31:00,578
and she creeped me out because
of the way that she looked.

627
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:04,248
Her skin looks like tree bark.

628
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,219
Her arms were really
long but, like, twisted,

629
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,272
and her fingers looked like tree roots.

630
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,257
So, it was very bizarre.

631
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,461
She is able to move objects
and open and close doors.

632
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:21,199
She's the one who can do
little things like that.

633
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:23,136
Talking about moving objects.

634
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,369
They had a guy named Ron

635
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:25,637
that's a brick mason working down there.

636
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,405
Ginny, tell 'em how
his stuff goes missing.

637
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,546
Stuff moves on its own down there.

638
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,113
He'll lay it down, and he'll
go he know he put it there.

639
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:35,365
And he'll go back to
get it, and it's gone.

640
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:39,968
It usually takes about twice
as long to do any work in here

641
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,486
because you spend half the time

642
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,988
just trying to find the
materials or the tools

643
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,491
because as soon as you turn
your back, they're gone.

644
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:49,010
That's, like up her alley, so.

645
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:50,879
Wow.

646
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:55,567
So, I met another lady.

647
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,827
I guess you could call
her, like, a nymphomaniac.

648
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,380
Considering where we
are, I'm not shocked.

649
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,550
She's interested in
younger, muscular men,

650
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:09,688
and she likes to touch people
inappropriately and sexually.

651
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,608
I did have a sketch done of her.

652
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,374
She was trying to seduce me.

653
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:32,444
It was shortly after
we bought the building,

654
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,547
and I was cleaning up all the cobwebs.

655
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:40,052
All of a sudden, I felt this
really warm hand on my shoulder.

656
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:43,134
Along with it, there was
really warm, gentle breath

657
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,434
across my neck.

658
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,694
So, do you think
she was a prostitute here?

659
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:51,921
Yeah, and I think she
very much enjoyed her job.

660
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:53,887
I mean, is it a threat to them?

661
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,191
Well, I think that being molested

662
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:01,929
in the middle of the night
would maybe be a problem.

663
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:07,318
So, what else is going on?

664
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,237
I met this guy.

665
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:13,891
He is a very dominant personality here,

666
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:16,978
and he concerns me a great deal.

667
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:20,832
He was not happy that I was here.

668
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:23,351
He's a very, very negative person.

669
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:27,855
People might see him as an elderly man,

670
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:32,460
or they see, like, a fog,
gray or a black fog.

671
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:36,431
I kept referring to him
as the landowner guy.

672
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,700
He goes everywhere,

673
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,802
but he does like to
hang out in the basement.

674
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,038
He is very physical.

675
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,241
If he doesn't like you,

676
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:50,645
he'll do things like
pushing, shoving, pinching.

677
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:54,799
If he really doesn't like somebody,

678
00:33:54,884 --> 00:33:56,584
he'll become even more violent.

679
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:59,053
He'll actually, like,
try to smother people.

680
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:02,223
And when he does that, it's
because he wants to kill them.

681
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:09,113
Now, you got shoved in the
face. Tell Amy what happened.

682
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,299
Ginny and
myself came in one night

683
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,635
and walked down the hall there,

684
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:19,140
and it just full force, fwoof,
and it knocked me backward.

685
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:22,710
Ginny was right behind
me, and I think she said,

686
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,062
"What the [bleep] was that?"

687
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:28,816
Now, she goes home with
bruises all the time.

688
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,352
I do go home with bruises
once in a while, yes, I do.

689
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,122
And it's other people... some
of the people on the tours.

690
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,524
Interesting.

691
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,293
Now, you mentioned something
about a mist, a shadow?

692
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,529
Now, you guys reported.

693
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,248
We see mists in here, you bet.

694
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:50,455
Do you feel threatened
sometimes by these incidents?

695
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:50,981
Yes.

696
00:34:51,627 --> 00:34:53,839
There's been a few times I've left.

697
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,524
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

698
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,278
Well, when he was alive,
he was very, very greedy.

699
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:04,096
I got that he was the boss.

700
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:05,031
Hmm.

701
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,766
I think that he was the first owner.

702
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:09,151
I think he possibly had something to do

703
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,534
with the building of this place.

704
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:15,298
There was a lot of business,
which he benefited greatly from.

705
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,103
And I got the years 1900 and
1901 specifically for him.

706
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:22,973
All right, so let me tell
you about the original owner

707
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:24,174
and see if we have a match.

708
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:26,042
His name was Joseph Nadeau,

709
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:28,879
and he built this building
as a brothel in 1890.

710
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:29,946
Oh!

711
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,615
And he opened up until he died in 1925.

712
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,750
The guy was a shrewd businessman.

713
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:35,352
He didn't own just this brothel.

714
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,587
He owned several brothels
in the neighborhood.

715
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,372
Now, I got a photo of him.

716
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,803
Okay.

717
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,458
This is very interesting.

718
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:03,964
When you guys first arrived,
I was looking at you.

719
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:06,817
And I was, like, looks really familiar.

720
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,354
What do you think about him?

721
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,775
It makes me shake.

722
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:18,678
It makes my heart pound,
and it makes my gut hurt.

723
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:21,548
But do you feel like any kind of,

724
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't know, attachment?

725
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:26,503
I think that I have
a duty here to...

726
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:30,540
Fulfill something, I don't know what it is.

727
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:35,645
I bought it the first
day I set foot in there.

728
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:36,880
'Cause you already owned it.

729
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:40,250
What the hell are you talking about?

730
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,154
You're this person.

731
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,694
So, you're telling me that
Michael is Joseph Nadeau.

732
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:13,650
Do you feel, like, any kind
of, I don't know, attachment?

733
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,686
I think that I have a duty
here to fulfill something,

734
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:18,770
I don't know what it is.

735
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:23,450
I bought it the first
day I set foot in there.

736
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:24,667
'Cause you already owned it.

737
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,854
What the hell are you talking about?

738
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:31,758
You're this person.

739
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:38,281
So, you're telling me that
Michael is Joseph Nadeau.

740
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:46,106
Yes.

741
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,273
Was he reincarnated?

742
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,659
Yes.

743
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:54,180
Whoa.

744
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:58,301
From the moment
I laid eyes on Michael,

745
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,521
I knew there was something
very familiar about him,

746
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:04,457
and when he talked about his
obsession with the brothel,

747
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,292
I got even more suspicious.

748
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:09,629
But when I saw the picture
of the original owner,

749
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:11,297
it all clicked.

750
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,733
It looks like an older
version of Michael.

751
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:19,989
Yeah, especially around the eyes.

752
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:28,348
He looks like my grandfather.

753
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,274
I felt something, though. I knew.

754
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,541
I knew it, but I don't want to feel like

755
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:36,127
some deceased person, some
spirit, some entity saying,

756
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,512
"You need to do my bidding."

757
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:40,448
It's not like you're
doing anybody's bidding.

758
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,449
This is you.

759
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:45,287
This is blowing me away.

760
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,422
I mean, this is one of these
cases I'm gonna walk away from,

761
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:49,457
and it's gonna be in the back
of my head for a long time.

762
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:52,377
I'm, like, nervous for
you. I'm scared for you.

763
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:56,948
I'm in awe of this. I'm
I'm, like, speechless.

764
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,535
My question to you is, though,

765
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,288
do you believe you're this guy?

766
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,723
Yes.

767
00:39:06,493 --> 00:39:08,543
How else do you explain any of it?

768
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,520
Needless to say, this is probably one of

769
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,422
the most unusual cases
that we've worked on.

770
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:23,558
Now we got to answer the big question.

771
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,794
Is it safe for you to stay here?

772
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:26,945
According to Amy, for the second time,

773
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,813
and fix this place up?

774
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,615
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy

775
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:31,816
and see what she has to say.

776
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:37,129
Right now, the situation
is not particularly healthy.

777
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:40,781
Your soul isn't complete

778
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:46,353
because you're continuing
a life that you had before.

779
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:52,125
What I think is going on is
that sometimes, when people die,

780
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:56,663
the soul in its entirety
doesn't completely move on.

781
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,615
So it'll shatter sometimes.

782
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,918
When Joseph died, his soul split.

783
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:04,838
One piece remained here
in the form of the old man,

784
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,807
and the other became you.

785
00:40:06,892 --> 00:40:11,912
So, what I want you to
do is to find a person

786
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:18,068
who is a reiki master who has
the ability to collect souls.

787
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:22,189
And what she does is
absorb them into herself,

788
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,540
and then she releases them.

789
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:27,661
So, your former self that's here,

790
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:34,468
she needs to collect that soul,
then needs to move that soul on.

791
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:36,353
Okay.

792
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,505
One thing I'm a little confused about.

793
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,274
If she takes Nadeau with her,

794
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:42,993
is he still reincarnated Joe Nadeau?

795
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:46,613
Yes, but once he moves on,

796
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:50,467
you may not have an interest
anymore in this place

797
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:54,922
and completely relinquish that fixation.

798
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,093
Now, what about the
tree lady and the nympho?

799
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:01,361
What about those people?

800
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:03,830
The reiki master will be
able to move them on, as well.

801
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,065
Okay.

802
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,019
This stuff is fascinating
when you think about it.

803
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:12,439
All the pieces, you know,
to this fit together.

804
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,158
Definitely.

805
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:18,612
I feel like a whole
weight has...

806
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:22,266
It's like I felt when I
walked in here the first time,

807
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:24,434
how it took my breath away.

808
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,187
I feel like I can breathe again.

809
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:29,255
It's gonna be quite the journey.
