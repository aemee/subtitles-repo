1
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,185
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,788
I feel like there's a man down here.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,590
He came and he bumped me.

4
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:18,291
Like, you know, I felt it.

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,860
Punching, slapping,
kicking. He's a bully.

6
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,562
So, it's still an open case?

7
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:24,531
Yes. It's an unsolved murder.

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,633
I'm gonna [bleep] kill you.

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,802
I've been through a lot in this house.

10
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,470
He's kinda freaked out.

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,539
They're everywhere.

12
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,241
He's disgusting and nasty.

13
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,877
There's a dark presence.

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,280
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:42,182
These things, they're freaking out.

16
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:43,416
They're from hell.

17
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:44,417
I see dead people.

18
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,119
They were being hunted.

19
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,854
I speak to dead people...

20
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:50,023
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

21
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,424
...and they speak to me.

22
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:52,792
Her neck got broken.

23
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,162
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

24
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,064
And I hear a gunshot.

25
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,600
- I rely on my partner.
- I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:03,336
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,471
Somethin's not right here.

28
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:08,008
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,543
- It's not safe here.
- It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:12,012
Are any of them buried on the property?

31
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,413
They're all buried here.

32
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,281
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,317
We never communicate
during an investigation...

34
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:19,419
- ...until the very end.
- I can't do it no more.

35
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:21,755
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:23,289
Holy [Bleep]. Look at this.

37
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:24,724
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:26,393
It does not have a happy ending.

39
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,561
Something kills people here.

40
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,477
I'm in the small town
of Canton, Illinois.

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,980
It's between Chicago and St. Louis.

42
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,882
Now, I got a call from a woman

43
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,684
who said she's at her breaking point.

44
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,919
Her 7-year-old
is so traumatized,

45
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,888
he won't go anywhere alone in the house.

46
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,923
She's says it's gotten physical,

47
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,992
and she's afraid he's gonna get hurt.

48
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,560
She's beggin' us for help.

49
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:08,802
Before Amy arrives,

50
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:11,871
I look for anything that
could influence her findings.

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,775
This home is covered with family photos

52
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:18,344
and spiritual items
that I need to remove.

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,684
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,930
In... in my opening, I saw
two of these big trees...

55
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,901
...and five shadow
men hanging from them.

56
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,572
There's something that's, like,

57
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:50,310
right outside here that is so bad.

58
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:55,215
Like, there is this dark wall
of energy around this place

59
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:58,785
because of whatever happened
to these five people,

60
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:04,357
and they're creating this,
like, cloud of sadness.

61
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,126
And they're creepy.

62
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,571
When you and
I spoke the phone, uh,

63
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:21,274
you sounded like a young
mom at her wit's end.

64
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,109
Let's start. What the hell's goin' on?

65
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,578
Um, I'm really worried about
my 7-year-old son, Layne.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,547
Things have been happening
in the house with him.

67
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,751
Where he can't even sleep in
his room without, you know,

68
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,052
four night-lights.

69
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,420
I can tell, like, most of the time,

70
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:36,589
Layne don't wanna be home
'cause he's terrified.

71
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:38,525
Is everybody in the
house having experiences?

72
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,126
- Yes.
- Okay, like what?

73
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:43,429
There's banging going
on, um, things moving.

74
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:46,766
Uh, we have seen
apparitions, shadow figures,

75
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,701
and it has been physical.

76
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,403
So, who exactly is living in the house?

77
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:53,406
- Um, my husband, Mike...
- Okay.

78
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:56,643
My son, Layne, and my
daughter, Hannelore.

79
00:03:56,745 --> 00:04:00,246
Layne is 7, and Hannelore
is about a year-and-a-half.

80
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:02,081
I'm worried that Hannelore is starting

81
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:05,185
to experience the same things
that Layne is experiencing.

82
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,587
She'll point that the
window and say, "Uh-oh,"

83
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,422
and... and kinda make a...

84
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,791
like, a whining noise like she's scared.

85
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,359
Now, you had mentioned that Layne

86
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,527
is gettin' the worst of it.

87
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,062
Yes. He gets upset.

88
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:18,298
He hyperventilates when he sees things.

89
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,134
Here's, um, a picture that he drew,

90
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:23,236
and he said it was the devil
that he's seen in his room.

91
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,774
He's got more pictures right here.

92
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,615
This poor kid.

93
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:39,419
He sees things that normal
7- year-olds don't see.

94
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:42,522
One of the reasons I did take this case

95
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,425
was because a child
was getting affected.

96
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,628
Why do you think Layne's
being affected so much?

97
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,863
I feel like they like him.

98
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:52,031
They gravitate towards him.

99
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,400
I mean, he says, "What do
they want? I want them gone."

100
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,336
And then I'm... I don't
know what to tell him.

101
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,772
I just want all of us
to be free and happy

102
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,841
and not scared to be here.

103
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,810
I don't know how much more I can take.

104
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,011
Okay.

105
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:14,691
I'm thinking that there
is a dead person here

106
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:20,830
who is capable or wants to
inflict physical pain on people,

107
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:25,068
or illness, uh, on living people.

108
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,573
It's, like, in this room

109
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:33,143
that I'm gettin' the big pull from him.

110
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,445
This is where he retreated to,

111
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,580
which kinda makes me nervous

112
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,382
'cause it seems like
it's a child's room,

113
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,518
so that's kind of unnerving.

114
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:45,422
I'm getting, like,
this 20-year-old male.

115
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:48,558
This dead guy, he
looks big. He's a bully.

116
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,363
He can bully, um, you know,
weak people, vulnerable people.

117
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,065
He's angry. He's very, very, very angry,

118
00:05:56,168 --> 00:06:02,172
and that does not bode well
for whoever might be in here.

119
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,176
So what's goin' on in here?

120
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:13,489
Um, I've seen shadow figures,
um, when I'm laying on the bed.

121
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:15,852
Um, I have one that was in my face.

122
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,855
I can feel them, on me, in my face.

123
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,223
Like, watching me.

124
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,424
You just said "them."

125
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,792
- Yeah.
- Is there more than one?

126
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,162
I did see another one
at a different time,

127
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:26,897
and it was at the end of the bed.

128
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,765
- Okay.
- And it was tall,

129
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,768
and it was, like, just
standing there, watching me.

130
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,802
Okay. Anything else?

131
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,539
In the bathroom, it was late.

132
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:40,043
I got in the shower, and I felt
like something was watching me.

133
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:43,313
And it was, um, it made me feel,
like, violated, like, disgusted.

134
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,781
I was disgusted.

135
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:48,185
I opened the curtain,
and I was like, "Get out!"

136
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,820
I knew it was there, and
as soon as I said that,

137
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,423
I felt, like, "Okay, now I
can at least take a shower."

138
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:54,991
So, you felt like a
Peepin' Tom or something?

139
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,227
- Yes, definitely.
- Okay.

140
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,467
I see, like, a woman with long hair.

141
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,303
And this is a living person.

142
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,438
And then, like, that guy.

143
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,607
This guy is dead,

144
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,643
and he's making moves on a living woman.

145
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:19,816
This person, it's
like she's not herself.

146
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,952
She's anxious and restless.

147
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:24,154
She's, like, pacing.

148
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:27,791
She's having, like, these,
like, weird, intrusive thoughts.

149
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:29,659
Like, she wants to run away.

150
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:32,762
She wants to leave this life.

151
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:35,398
I- I mean, I think it might be this male

152
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,133
who's, like, influencing her,

153
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:39,035
but she's fighting
it, like, all the time.

154
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,204
And that's, like, the
restlessness and the pacing

155
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,473
and the can't sleep
and, like, the, you know,

156
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:47,110
trying to, like, relax and, like, focus.

157
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:49,145
He's, like, freaking out now
that I'm talking about it.

158
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,314
He doesn't like it. He's
getting really anxious

159
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,517
and really upset and he's just, like...

160
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,152
Ow.

161
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:57,721
My neck and my head.

162
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:06,563
I hate being down here.

163
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,431
It definitely creeps me out to be here.

164
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,666
Okay. Why?

165
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,401
When I have to come
down here and do laundry,

166
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,337
I always feel like
somebody is watching me.

167
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:16,973
I feel like it's a man.

168
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,575
Is it the same feeling
you get in the bathroom?

169
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:20,410
Yes. Exact same feeling.

170
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,213
Every time I come down here,
I have the exact same feeling.

171
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:24,514
Do you feel it right this second
while you're in front of me?

172
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:25,682
Yes.

173
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,150
- Now, where are you feelin' it?
- Right there.

174
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,219
Okay.

175
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,421
Recently he, um, came

176
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:33,923
and he bumped me to get my attention.

177
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:36,293
Like, he definitely
wanted me to feel him.

178
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,862
- Do it to me.
- So it was like... that.

179
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:40,330
Okay, so it was pretty significant.

180
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:43,333
So it was, like... It,
like, you know, I felt it.

181
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,734
I know you're a mom.
You gotta do laundry.

182
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,469
But how the hell do you
come down here every day?

183
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,204
I mean, I hate coming down here.

184
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:50,674
I feel like I'm a
prisoner in my own home.

185
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,979
I feel like
there's a man down here.

186
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,850
Very, uh, aggressive male down here.

187
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,120
Mm.

188
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:10,894
He was an older male, uh,
probably, like, 50s, maybe?

189
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:14,631
And he's a big guy.
Like, he's kinda chubby.

190
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,333
I don't know how they would see him,

191
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:19,602
but I think they could see something.

192
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:22,672
He can be very aggressive
towards the living,

193
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,175
'cause this is very
much his [bleep] space.

194
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,679
What does he do to them?

195
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,182
He likes to trip people a lot.

196
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:35,452
Like, he'll kneel down and
wait and then grab them.

197
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:37,620
He, like, rushes them.

198
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:43,960
I think they'll see something,
like, barreling towards them,

199
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:44,994
right up on them.

200
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,197
He's just disgusting and nasty.

201
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,965
I don't like him.

202
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:11,197
So, Mike, it looks like you're
doing renovations, obviously.

203
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,732
Yeah. Okay, so how long you...

204
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:13,933
this been going on?

205
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:15,702
Almost 5 years.

206
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:17,303
- Five years?
- Yes.

207
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,372
It takes so long 'cause
I'm uncomfortable up here.

208
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:20,507
It really bothers me.

209
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,675
What about your
experiences? What's goin' on?

210
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:25,211
In the basement, we have
an old coal room down there,

211
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:27,280
and when I was putting
together the pool table,

212
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,349
I looked over and seen
an old man starin' at me

213
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:30,583
through a plate glass window.

214
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:31,885
Inside the coal room?

215
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:33,686
Inside the coal room, you
know, just looking out.

216
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:36,823
I probably sat there for 5...
5 minutes, just lookin' back.

217
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,491
You know, your wife felt
something watching her

218
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:39,626
from that window, too.

219
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:41,094
So describe what the
old man looked like.

220
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,929
All I seen was his
shoulders and his face,

221
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:46,065
and he just looked old and
his face was just wrinkly.

222
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,734
It freaked me out so
much that the next day,

223
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,769
I went down with a can of spray paint,

224
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,638
and I spray painted that window black.

225
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,839
Okay. Anything else?

226
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,340
Whenever I'm up here workin',

227
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,009
overwhelming feeling
somebody's standin' right there

228
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:57,443
in the doorway watchin' me.

229
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,145
I cannot stop lookin' over my shoulder

230
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:01,981
to see what's there, but
there's never anything there.

231
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,316
You gettin' that feeling right now?

232
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:04,484
Yeah. You do?

233
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:05,785
And is it...
I've got a feeling

234
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,187
that somebody's standing
right there, watching me.

235
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,454
Okay.

236
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,226
Oh, boy.

237
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,360
I don't like in there though.

238
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:17,664
It's terrible. It's terrible energy.

239
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,333
Okay, so there's this old woman.

240
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,102
She's, like, talking about, uh,

241
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,971
somethin' up here, somebody.

242
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:27,273
She does not like him.

243
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,475
Would the living be
affected by this in any way?

244
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,580
I would think yeah,
maybe feeling oppression.

245
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:36,182
Maybe, like, an oppressive anxiety?

246
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,718
And they feel her watching them.

247
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,457
I don't like it in here.

248
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,826
She would make the living feel sick.

249
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,362
They would have, like,
intestinal issues.

250
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:51,431
I don't like her. I don't
really want to talk to her.

251
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,335
She is [bleep] so mean.

252
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,471
She's like, "I'm gonna
[bleep] kill you!"

253
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:07,146
How old are you now, Layne?

254
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,082
- 7.
- Okay.

255
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:11,251
I was talkin' to Mommy, and she
was telling was telling me that,

256
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:12,919
uh, some of the things that
are happening in the house

257
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,854
- make you afraid.
- Yes.

258
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,923
Tell me about some of
the stuff you've seen.

259
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,626
I hear children laughing,
a boy and a girl.

260
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,761
And there was a guy right there.

261
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:24,897
He was a black mass.

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
There was an angel there.

263
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:30,069
I saw floating dolls.

264
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:35,508
They had stitch-up eyes
and it was really creepy.

265
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,110
You know, I can believe
what I'm hearing.

266
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,046
This kid is firing off
experience after experience

267
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,815
to the point where I can barely keep up.

268
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,151
I saw a black figure in the bathroom.

269
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,654
It was, like, crunched down like this,

270
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,356
and it was pretty creepy.

271
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,859
Either Layne has an
overactive imagination

272
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,962
or he's seen way too
much, way too young.

273
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,130
I saw the devil.

274
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,865
Okay, where'd you see the devil?

275
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,067
Right here.

276
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,335
Okay. Tell me about that.

277
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,037
He had horns.

278
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,238
What about his face?

279
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,506
Red. Red.

280
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,641
And he had black hair.

281
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:11,744
He was, like, smiling so freaky at me.

282
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:14,213
Okay. Is that the one you drew
the picture for, for Mommy?

283
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,449
- Yes.
- How do you know it's the devil?

284
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,717
I know it's the devil.

285
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:20,353
I don't know why, but I know it's evil.

286
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,989
How do you know all this?
You seem pretty smart.

287
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,692
Thank you. 'Cause I'm just kind of open.

288
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:28,394
Okay, so what do you think
these things your seeing want?

289
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,829
They probably want to go to the light

290
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:31,397
so they can go to heaven.

291
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,133
So, do you think that when
people are bad in life,

292
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,368
they go down?

293
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,736
- Yes.
- Okay.

294
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,137
And when you're a good
guy or a good girl you up?

295
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,172
- Up.
- Yep.

296
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:41,641
Okay. You're a good guy.

297
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:42,775
- Thank you.
- Okay.

298
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,577
- You are, too.
- Thank you.

299
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,779
Appreciate that. All right.

300
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:48,648
So it sounds like this stuff
is scaring you in the house.

301
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,149
You don't want to be
here alone, I understand?

302
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:53,219
Yeah, I've been through
a lot in this house.

303
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,921
They're everywhere.

304
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:00,593
I'm seeing the
younger dead guy again.

305
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:01,694
This 20-year-old,

306
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:04,397
he's squatting down in the closet.

307
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:07,467
So I think, like, he might
be afraid of me a little bit.

308
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:09,736
He feels like he can't hurt me,

309
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,871
so he's, like, kind of freaked out.

310
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:14,507
And he takes his
finger and he's, like...

311
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,145
...doing this kind of stuff.

312
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:23,850
And he's, like, laughing
'cause he knows it's disturbing.

313
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:26,018
- So, the people hear that?
- Yes.

314
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:28,521
It's like a spooky, creepy elf.

315
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:31,624
And he's got, like,
sharp teeth, you know,

316
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:33,926
um, and long nails.

317
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,194
What does he do?

318
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:40,333
He wants to physically harm...

319
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,269
punching, slapping,
kicking, or make them sick.

320
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:47,573
He can hurt vulnerable people.

321
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:49,942
This is pretty... pretty serious.

322
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,920
Mike and Angie didn't
know much about the history

323
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:06,421
of their property,

324
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,291
so I'm at the local library
to see what I can dig up.

325
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:10,692
Searching through old records,

326
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:14,463
I find a brutal rape and
murder of an 8-year-old girl.

327
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:16,064
Turns out this sick, twisted crime

328
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,801
happened less than a mile
from my client's house.

329
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,571
I'm on my way to meet with
a criminal defense attorney

330
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,641
who says the case remains
a mystery to this day.

331
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,382
The 8-year-old girl
that was murdered

332
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,384
right near my client's property,
what'd you find out about it?

333
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,819
It was November 1955.

334
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,689
Janice May went missing from her house.

335
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,357
Her two brothers went lookin' for her.

336
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,926
Uh, the family dog led
them to the rail road tracks,

337
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,061
and next to the rail road tracks there

338
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:48,930
was some abandoned mining cars.

339
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,199
There, the brothers found
their sister shoved underneath

340
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:52,768
one of the cars. Oh, you're kiddin' me.

341
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,270
She had a terrible skull fracture

342
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,972
on the right side of her face.

343
00:15:57,074 --> 00:15:58,240
- Okay.
- There was a concrete block

344
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:00,075
sitting next to her with blood on it.

345
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,144
She was half-nude.

346
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:04,413
It was determined she
was sexually assaulted.

347
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:06,048
Did the police make an arrest?

348
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,650
The police interviewed
about 30 different suspects.

349
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,919
Ultimately, they
focused on Lloyd Miller,

350
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:13,088
a local taxi cab driver.

351
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,490
It turned out that
right after this crime,

352
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:16,992
he quickly fled town.

353
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:21,029
They found Lloyd Miller in
a town 150 miles from Canton.

354
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,264
He was at a bus station,

355
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:25,434
trying to get a bus
ticket to go to Detroit.

356
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:26,968
They brought him in for questioning.

357
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,236
Miller denied involvement

358
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,105
but after several days of interrogation,

359
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,673
he ultimately confessed.

360
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:32,974
What do we know about this guy?

361
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,477
At this time, he was 29 years old.

362
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,146
Miller completed the first
two years of high school,

363
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,848
but then he was drafted in the military.

364
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,150
He served in Italy durin' World War II.

365
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,519
After he was discharged,
he came back to the States.

366
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,755
And his dream was to become
an auto mechanic in Detroit.

367
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:48,557
But he hopped around job to job.

368
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,260
He ultimately joined the
Coast Guard, also the Army.

369
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,429
But he went AWOL three separate times.

370
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,565
He was sent to the stockade each time.

371
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,733
Wow.

372
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,701
He also got in trouble in California.

373
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:02,170
For what? Uh, he and
a friend stole a car.

374
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,473
He ended up spending 7
months in a prison farm.

375
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,007
So this guy's all over the map.

376
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,510
He was somewhat
unpredictable and impulsive.

377
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,746
He got married four times,

378
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,547
and a couple of these marriages

379
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:15,050
to women he had only met
for the past few days.

380
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,218
Who the hell does that?

381
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,053
Sounds like a bit of a whack job.

382
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,249
This 20-year-old,

383
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:26,452
he doesn't like to think about
his life 'cause it was not good.

384
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,054
It was very bad.

385
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,389
He was a real tough guy.

386
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:32,225
He was a bully when he was alive.

387
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,428
He got... I think he
got thrown out of school.

388
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,597
He was in and out of prison.

389
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:39,532
And he hated his [bleep] mother.

390
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,902
Wow. Like, real, like, [bleep] hate.

391
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,939
I'm seeing like a garage...

392
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:52,979
...and, like, wrenches and, um, oil.

393
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:56,616
I wanna say he worked on
cars or something like this.

394
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:58,384
He's freakin' out.

395
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:01,187
All right, so how'd the trial go?

396
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,722
The jury convicted him,

397
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:05,358
and a judge sentenced him to
death by the electric chair.

398
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,094
He had seven different execution dates.

399
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:10,063
So, Dale, I noticed it
went to the Supreme Court.

400
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,431
Do we know why?

401
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,466
The defense team, throughout
these 10 years of appeals,

402
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,202
started dismantling the state's case.

403
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,504
The so-called confession
that Miller signed,

404
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,706
he never wrote it.

405
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,441
It was written by the police officers.

406
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,945
In February 1967,

407
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,182
the United States Supreme
Court overturned the conviction.

408
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:31,684
And in March 20th, 1967,

409
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:33,953
Miller walked out of
death row a free man.

410
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:35,255
Do we know what happens to him?

411
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,489
He moved to Mexico.

412
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:38,625
He got remarried, again.

413
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,361
Uh, he ended up writing a
book about his ordeals here.

414
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,229
Um, he ultimately became a minister.

415
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,964
Do we know if this
guy's still alive today?

416
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:47,133
No, he's not. He died in 2013

417
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:50,069
in Reading, Pennsylvania,
at the age of 86.

418
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,739
Did cops back then ever
look into this case again

419
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,541
and look at anybody else,
question anybody else about it?

420
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:56,910
Not that we could tell.

421
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,411
So it's still an open case?

422
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,246
Yes, it's an unsolved murder.

423
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:07,820
If you need us to investigate

424
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,656
unexplained activity in your home,

425
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:12,458
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

426
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,260
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

427
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,528
and we'll help if we can.

428
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,755
During my research, I
came across several families

429
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,455
who used to own my client's land.

430
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,224
Now one family, the Barrys, stood out.

431
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:35,593
Three of them died
right on the property.

432
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:37,395
I'm on my way to meet with a genealogist

433
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,731
who says this family
suffered from illness,

434
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,933
depression, and madness.

435
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:49,674
So, Julie, thanks for
helpin' me out with my case.

436
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,277
The Barry family... what
can you tell me about them?

437
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:55,013
Bernard and his wife, Mary, um,

438
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,714
were both Irish immigrants

439
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,083
who came over to the U.S. in the 1850s

440
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:00,952
- during the potato famine.
- Okay.

441
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:05,924
Bernard and his wife, Mary,
purchased the property in 1890.

442
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,058
Who moved there with them?

443
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,694
A daughter, Maryann, who was 30.

444
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:12,266
And then their youngest
daughter, Francis, who was 15.

445
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,466
Now I know there was deaths
associated with family

446
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:15,801
on the property.

447
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,102
What'd you find out?

448
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,871
Well, the first one occurred in 1915,

449
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:22,107
and that was Mary, the wife.

450
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:25,177
Okay. Have her obituary here.

451
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,515
She became ill and
suffered for nearly a year

452
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,318
until she contracted pneumonia

453
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,788
and lived with that
painfully for 5 days, uh,

454
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,657
before she finally passed.

455
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,625
I have a copy of her
death certificate here

456
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,362
which lists pneumonia
as the 'cause of death.

457
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:46,198
- Oh, she was 82?
- Yeah.

458
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,569
And you know, my mother
suffered same age from emphysema

459
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:52,337
and wound up dyin' from pneumonia.

460
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,072
- And that's a miserable...
- Yes.

461
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,273
...way of life.

462
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:01,446
I'm seeing that angry older woman again.

463
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:06,117
She kinda looks like
an older Irish lady.

464
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,587
I hear, like, "Mabel."

465
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:11,423
I think she was, like, 70 when she died.

466
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:14,960
I think she's got, like,
cancer or something.

467
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:16,394
This is what she dies from.

468
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,763
And this is, like, a long time ago.

469
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:22,467
I would say this is, like, '20s, '30s?

470
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:23,869
And the guy's, like, big.

471
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:26,037
Her husband's, like, a big guy.

472
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,173
They didn't have a good marriage.

473
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,608
And it was the woman,

474
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,078
this little woman who would... you know,

475
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,981
I think she beat the [bleep]
out of her husband all the time.

476
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,918
Like, pretty bad.

477
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,820
This is strange.

478
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:44,556
Mary's death certificate
lists her son, Bernard Jr.,

479
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:46,258
as the informant.

480
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,028
Yes, we know that Bernard Sr., uh,

481
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,664
was suffering from
dementia when he died.

482
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,065
So it's quite possible

483
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,202
that his son was the informant
on the death certificate

484
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:58,937
because he might've started

485
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,139
to show signs of dementia at this point.

486
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,875
Okay, so now that Mary's dead,
who's taking care of Bernard?

487
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,744
Their daughter, Maryann,

488
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,480
she's the primary
caregiver for her father,

489
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,449
who's probably continuing
on in his dementia.

490
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:14,886
At some point, she
gets extremely depressed

491
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:19,391
and she starves herself,
um, and dies as a result.

492
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:21,126
- She starved herself to death?
- Yes.

493
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:24,796
We have a copy of her
death certificate here.

494
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,498
She was 56.

495
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,467
And you'll notice that they
do list a contributing factor

496
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,236
of melancholia.

497
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,171
So what happens to the dad?

498
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:37,242
By 1926, his suffering finally ends.

499
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,044
- Okay, he...
- He passes away on the property.

500
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:41,179
Okay, so what's the official
cause of death for him?

501
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:45,884
Well, his death certificate
lists heart failure

502
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:49,187
with a contributing factor of senility.

503
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,494
Another thing caught my eye in research.

504
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:57,896
It was a deadly factory
explosion down the block

505
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,698
from Michael and Angie's house.

506
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,933
I reached out to a
historian who said it was

507
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,903
one of the biggest tragedies
in the town's history.

508
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:13,879
So I gotta assume this
is where the factory was?

509
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:15,247
That's right. This was, uh, the location

510
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:19,217
of the Parlin Orendorff
manufacturing company.

511
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,686
Okay. What did they manufacture?

512
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,789
Well, mostly farm products
and especially the steel plow,

513
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:26,291
which was so important to
the evolution of farming

514
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:27,959
in the Midwest.

515
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:30,429
This is a picture of
how the plant looked

516
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:32,764
at its very best.

517
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,966
Okay, so the day of the
explosion, what happened?

518
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:37,502
It was December 18, 1882.

519
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,171
7:00 in the morning, the first shift

520
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:40,372
had just gone on the job.

521
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,908
7:10, this tremendous explosion occurs.

522
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,410
Debris is shot up into
the air all over town.

523
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:47,479
It falls in peoples' yards.

524
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:50,182
Many people thought there
had been an earthquake.

525
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,451
Uh, buildings shook, windows rattled,

526
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,752
people ran out of their houses

527
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:55,854
to try to find out what was going on.

528
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:59,224
What had happened was
that three of the boilers,

529
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,926
which were used to generate steam

530
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:04,763
which powered the equipment
in the plant, had exploded.

531
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,766
The building came down on the
workers, fell down on them,

532
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,167
and a fire was started.

533
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:12,471
Some of the employees who
had escaped the explosion

534
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:15,340
tried to go in and see if
they could save some people.

535
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,541
Right.

536
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:18,977
Well, they got in and
found six people dead

537
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,846
- right at their workstation.
- Ah.

538
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,515
And the interesting thing about
that was they died in a position

539
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,384
which suggests they had no idea

540
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,753
that an explosion was about to happen.

541
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:30,555
They did find four people
who were still living

542
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:31,823
and they carried them out.

543
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,125
Three of those died.

544
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:35,594
So the number of people
killed in the explosion

545
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,729
- was nine people killed.
- Nine people killed.

546
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,431
- Yeah.
- And six right at their stations?

547
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:40,599
That's right. Six never moved.

548
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah. Right.

549
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:43,602
People must've been like,
"What the hell was that?"

550
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:44,669
Oh, absolutely.

551
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,037
People from all over town

552
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,306
were... they were just so
startled by this, that it...

553
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,542
they were running to the plant
to find out about what's...

554
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:52,351
And it so dominated the...
the economy, the area.

555
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:52,803
Right.

556
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,046
Everybody was concerned about it, yeah.

557
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,655
I feel, like, disoriented.

558
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:08,126
I am seeing people coming this way

559
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:12,130
towards the house from...

560
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:15,233
the dirt driveway from this direction.

561
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,468
Any idea when this was?

562
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,603
Like, the '20s or '30s.

563
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:21,273
I do here, like, a lot
of yelling and stuff.

564
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:29,325
There's a lot of commotion,
uh, going on. Like, angry.

565
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,461
Everybody's just
agitated and pissed off.

566
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:34,663
It's all crazy.

567
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,339
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

568
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,743
but the 20-year-old bully
concerned me the most.

569
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,512
He's white.

570
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,181
His face shape was more squared.

571
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:55,651
And he had a weird-kinda look.

572
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:58,521
Next, I described how
he torments the living.

573
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,489
He's in the closet

574
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,592
and he's, like, scratching his
finger down the closet door.

575
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:05,594
And it's just, like, a black hole.

576
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,167
In the room, there's a
kid being freaked out.

577
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,805
Amy, is this what you saw?

578
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,606
Yes, that's what I saw.

579
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,033
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

580
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:42,835
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

581
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:45,972
and our clients for the first time.

582
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:48,407
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Mike and Angie.

583
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,143
They're a great,
down-to-Earth couple, uh,

584
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:53,879
who are going through a
hell of a time in this house.

585
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:57,850
But this is the reason I took this case.

586
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,752
This is their son, Layne.

587
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,087
Now Layne is 7,

588
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:04,190
and he's basically scared
to death in his own house.

589
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,425
The activity here is
ruining his childhood.

590
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:10,696
And they're worried now
that even their daughter,

591
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,265
Hannelore, is startin'
to have these experiences.

592
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,434
Mike and Angie don't know
how to protect their kids,

593
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,336
and they're desperate for help.

594
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:20,206
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about your family dynamics,

595
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:21,541
I'll have her describe her walk for us.

596
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,366
There's several conscious entities

597
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:26,868
who are very active here.

598
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,170
The first one was an elderly woman

599
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,740
who has major anger control issues.

600
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:35,610
And I encountered her upstairs.

601
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:39,380
Her energy is really horrendous.

602
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:44,318
The living would feel
her stress and her fear

603
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,421
and this oppressive anxiety.

604
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:49,023
And she's always watching.

605
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,159
Uh, that's her big thing. You
know, Amy, you might've noticed

606
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:54,028
the upstairs is under construction.

607
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,564
Mike's been tryin' to turn
it into a master bedroom.

608
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,733
Why don't you explain to
Amy why it's not finished?

609
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,636
That is almost a
5- year-long project.

610
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,939
When I'm up there, I
have so much bad feelings,

611
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,974
I just can't get any work done up there.

612
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,042
It's like somebody's just sittin' there,

613
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,143
starin' right at me.

614
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:11,279
It freaks the hell outta me.

615
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,081
So this old, cranky woman...
any idea who she might've been?

616
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:16,250
She lived here with her husband.

617
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:18,786
They had a terrible marriage.

618
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:21,455
And interestingly, she beat him.

619
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:23,024
Oh, my.

620
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:24,892
Yeah. And he was, like, a big guy,

621
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,127
and she was really short.

622
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:27,995
She was, like, 5 feet tall.

623
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,597
I think she was from Ireland.

624
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,032
I got the name Mabel.

625
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:33,501
She was in her 70s when she died,

626
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:36,203
and I think it was cancer.

627
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:37,471
It's a long shot,

628
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:39,273
but one of the original
owners on the property

629
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,741
was an Irish woman.

630
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,543
Her name wasn't Mabel, but it was Mary.

631
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,378
Mary Barry was her name.

632
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,882
She and her husband, Bernard,
moved onto the property in 1890.

633
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:49,150
They were older when they moved here.

634
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:50,484
They were both in their 50s.

635
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,954
But the husband, Bernard,
started to lose his mind.

636
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:54,855
He started havin' dementia.

637
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,924
Mary may have had a hard
time takin' care of him.

638
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,194
In 1915, Mary came down
with terrible illness.

639
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:02,763
The official cause
of death is pneumonia.

640
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,568
Now the woman you saw, you
said might've died in her 70s.

641
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,471
Uh, Mary Barry was 82 when she died.

642
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:11,772
Okay.

643
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:14,375
Now she had a daughter
who died a horrible death

644
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,111
on the property as
well, only 3 years later.

645
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,213
Mm. Her name was Maryann.

646
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,915
She was takin' care of her dad,

647
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,751
and she got extremely depressed

648
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,454
and she starved herself to death.

649
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,456
Now Bernard stayed on the property

650
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,292
and he sank deeper and
deeper into this illness.

651
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,260
And he died about 10 years later.

652
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,463
Now, could Mary be the woman you saw?

653
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,231
'Cause you said she was
a housewife and Irish.

654
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,833
- I believe so, yes.
- Okay.

655
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:40,434
I do. Could she be the reason

656
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,603
Mike's so uncomfortable
on the second floor?

657
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:44,305
Yeah.

658
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,241
The other thing is, you're
kinda the same, like,

659
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:51,979
build and height as her husband.

660
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,483
So I wonder if she's...

661
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,984
Confusing me with him?

662
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,386
Yeah.

663
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:03,991
What else did you see on the walk?

664
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,601
So then I came down here.

665
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:08,736
I did not like it.

666
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:10,738
I felt, like, very dizzy.

667
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,542
And then I saw this
little man down here.

668
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:17,445
He was chubby. He was in his 50s.

669
00:30:17,547 --> 00:30:22,583
And his favorite area is
over in the corner over there.

670
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,418
He likes that.

671
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,254
He can get very
aggressive with the living

672
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:28,856
when they come down here.

673
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,458
You'll actually kinda feel him, like,

674
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,662
barreling towards you,
invading your space.

675
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:38,866
And he also does shove and push.

676
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:41,235
Tell her the story about
the old man you saw.

677
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,704
I was down here putting
together the pool table,

678
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,072
and I just happened to look up.

679
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,174
All I could see was his
shoulders and his face

680
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:48,576
in that window.

681
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:51,512
And I sat here, petrified,
for about 5 minutes, just,

682
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,114
"Am I seein' what I'm seein'?"

683
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:54,548
And the reason that window's black

684
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,016
is 'cause I painted it black.

685
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,719
- Oh,.
- Yeah.

686
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:02,556
I feel like he's, like,
right here, creeping on me.

687
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:04,191
Tell her about
when you got bumped.

688
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:06,293
I was down her doin'
laundry, I was folding it.

689
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:09,397
Um, all of a sudden from the back,

690
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:10,998
he, like, bumped into me.

691
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,567
- Mm.
- Like, you can feel it.

692
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,436
I'm thinkin' you're seein' her husband.

693
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,638
- The husband with dementia?
- Yeah.

694
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,407
I wonder if this guy's watchin' you now.

695
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,608
Without a doubt.

696
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,777
He's always there.

697
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,545
We're not gonna provoke him.

698
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,484
So what else did you see?

699
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:32,286
Uh, went into the yellow room...

700
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:33,320
Which is Layne's room.

701
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:37,091
And, uh, I saw a
dead 20-year-old.

702
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,459
He's a bully,

703
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,229
and he likes to prey on
the weak and the vulnerable.

704
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:46,500
The thing about him, he
can take different forms.

705
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:50,404
So, like, I saw him
acting like a creepy elf.

706
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:53,607
He has, like, the pointed
ears, sharp teeth, long nails.

707
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,810
And his eyes can get really, you know,

708
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:57,945
he'll make 'em dark and evil-looking.

709
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,314
He can cause illness,

710
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:06,587
but what he would prefer to
do is punch or kick or slap.

711
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:11,125
He wants to be physical
with this person.

712
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:12,860
Well, that's why we're here.

713
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:15,029
Layne and I spoke for a long time,

714
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:19,533
and he had too many
experiences to go through.

715
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,069
When you mentioned
this elf-like creature,

716
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:26,006
Angie, tell Amy how Layne
describes how he sees the devil.

717
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:27,475
He hyperventilated.

718
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:31,178
Like, he couldn't even
talk about what he'd seen.

719
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,315
He'd explain it like he's
holding onto his toy chest

720
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,484
and, like... like smiling, like,

721
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,085
"Yeah, I'm gonna getcha."

722
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:40,054
Like, to scare him.

723
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:42,623
It breaks my heart to look at this,

724
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:45,192
but this is what he says he sees.

725
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:46,393
Wow.

726
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:48,395
And he said to me, it's the devil.

727
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:52,266
I had a sketch done of what
I saw goin' on in the room.

728
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:01,242
Oh, this poor kid.

729
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:06,313
Oh, my God.

730
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,686
Sorry.

731
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:16,724
Sorry.

732
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:23,197
It's just not fair,
you know?

733
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,100
That it scares him,
and I can't protect him.

734
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:32,339
Now Layne told me that
he thinks he's open.

735
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:33,440
- Yes.
- Yeah.

736
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:34,942
Really?

737
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:36,644
He talks like he's 40.

738
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:39,380
And it scares kids away.

739
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:43,083
I got a message from a
parent saying that they just

740
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:45,419
don't want their child
to hang out with Layne.

741
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,956
Him sounding
like a 40-year-old

742
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:51,892
is pretty common with
sensitives 'cause basically,

743
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,695
they've really been
surrounded by subject matter

744
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:57,398
that is way beyond their years.

745
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,600
The dead come and they show and tell you

746
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,335
their entire life story...

747
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:02,703
Whoa.

748
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:04,672
...before they can move on.

749
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:06,607
So we think Layne's a medium.

750
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,742
Yeah.

751
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:17,585
I then followed the dead
guy into the master bedroom.

752
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:20,688
I saw him with a living woman

753
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,858
and I saw the dead man being
sexually inappropriate with her,

754
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:28,762
maybe putting sexual
thoughts into her mind.

755
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:32,132
In the bathroom, uh, if I
take showers late at night,

756
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,301
there's definitely a male in there,

757
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:35,936
to the point where it was after midnight

758
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:39,006
and I yelled, "Get out!"

759
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,574
I also felt this guy

760
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:44,278
would make this living woman
feel restless and anxious,

761
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,347
and I saw her pacing around.

762
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,649
And she's having weird,
intrusive thoughts,

763
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:51,585
like she wants to run
away and leave this life.

764
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:55,789
I do have, um, restless
nights, lots of restless nights.

765
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:58,492
Okay.

766
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:01,695
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

767
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,865
I know he had a very bad
life, very rough life.

768
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:09,069
I got that he was from
the '30s and the '40s.

769
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,970
Uh, a bully in life,
just like he is in death,

770
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,670
and he either dropped out
of school or was kicked out.

771
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:18,239
I wasn't sure I got
the whole story on that.

772
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:21,042
Um, he was in and out of prisons.

773
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:25,480
And I saw him with oil and
wrenches and in a garage,

774
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,782
so I think he worked on cars as well.

775
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:29,551
That was like,
his... his thing.

776
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:32,687
Uh, and I'm not sure
when or how he died.

777
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,689
You said the guy was
in and out of prison,

778
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,791
high school dropout, worked on cars.

779
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:40,428
So I do have one guy in my
research that fits that bill.

780
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,665
In 1955, there was an
8- year-old girl named Janice May

781
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,334
who was found beaten
and sexually assaulted

782
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,136
4,000 feet from your property.

783
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:51,372
I got a photo of her here.

784
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,875
She was unconscious but
alive, taken to the hospital,

785
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:56,010
and died an hour later.

786
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,446
They ended up arresting
a 29-year-old male

787
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,115
by the name of Lloyd Miller,

788
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:02,951
who was a taxi driver in town.

789
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,887
I got a picture of this guy right here.

790
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,556
Oh,.

791
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,493
Now, this guy sounds a lot like
the guy you met in Layne's room.

792
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:14,129
He was a high school dropout,
he was in the Coast Guard

793
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:17,031
and the Army, but went
AWOL three separate times.

794
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,534
In his early 20s, he
stole a car in California

795
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,370
and spent 7 months in a prison farm.

796
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,607
His dream was to work as
an auto mechanic in Detroit,

797
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:28,676
but he drifted from job to
job, mostly as a laborer.

798
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:31,279
After the murder, they
found him 150 miles away

799
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,014
on his way to Detroit,

800
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:34,449
and they arrested him.

801
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,519
After 2 days of interrogation,
he confessed to the murder.

802
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,521
Now later on, he recanted

803
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:42,123
and said he was coerced
into this confession,

804
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,424
but he was convicted

805
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,760
and sentenced to the electric chair.

806
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,829
Now eventually, it was found

807
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,598
that the prosecution
fudged some of the evidence.

808
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,068
In 1967, the Supreme Court
overturned his conviction.

809
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,670
He was a free man.

810
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:58,873
He wind out moving to
Mexico, got married,

811
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:00,308
and became a minister.

812
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,810
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- No.

813
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:04,312
He came back to the States

814
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,714
and he died in Reading,
Pennsylvania, in 2013

815
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:07,949
at the age of 86.

816
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,751
Oh, my gosh.

817
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:12,921
Wow.

818
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,423
All right, now do you
think this guy could be Miller?

819
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,892
I had a sketch done of him, so...

820
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:20,862
All right.

821
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,999
Well, he's 29 in this photo.

822
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,238
Wow.

823
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,806
Take a look at this.

824
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,675
Oh.

825
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:37,712
Whoa.

826
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:41,683
Like... to me, it's identical.
Like, the nose, the lips...

827
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,284
The... the
nose and the lips is...

828
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,919
The eyebrows.

829
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,356
So this son of a [bleep]

830
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,758
Is the one acting like
a devil to a 7-year-old?

831
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,594
Yes.

832
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:58,002
This guy totally did this.

833
00:37:58,104 --> 00:37:59,537
I want to grab the son of a

834
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,172
By his throat right now.

835
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:03,441
I'm really pissed off.

836
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:05,043
It's on.

837
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:20,853
So this son of a

838
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:23,422
Is the one acting like
a devil to a 7-year-old?

839
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:25,291
Yes.

840
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:31,063
This guy totally did this.

841
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:32,498
I want to grab the son of a

842
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,699
By his throat right now.

843
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,101
I'm really pissed off.

844
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,303
It's on.

845
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:42,108
So why is this dirt bag here?

846
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,011
When he died, he came right back

847
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:48,247
to his favorite memory
and his happiest moment,

848
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:50,750
which would be killing that child.

849
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,218
And then you guys moved in.

850
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,121
And he's drawn to Layne
because of his abilities.

851
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:57,557
And then the sexual thing
is coming out, unfortunately,

852
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:59,158
in... in your direction.

853
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:07,133
So, Mike and Angie, when we spoke,

854
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:10,203
you guys told me family comes first

855
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:12,305
and you'd do anything
to protect your kids.

856
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:14,640
Now I'm gonna find out
exactly what that's gonna take,

857
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,542
and for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

858
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:28,821
The main person I want involved
is to be a male who's a medium.

859
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:34,160
And I want this male to
be a pretty tough cookie.

860
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:38,598
I want him to then deal
with the elderly female.

861
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,100
This is going to be a process,

862
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:44,170
and it's probably not gonna
be a pleasant one for him

863
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:47,240
because he does need to
be aggressive with her.

864
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,675
Once she goes, her husband'll go.

865
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:53,112
Then I want him to come
back with a demonologist

866
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:55,414
to get rid of him.

867
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:57,250
And I don't think he has
any intentions of moving on

868
00:39:57,352 --> 00:40:01,053
because he is perfectly
happy where he is.

869
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:04,090
That's when the demonologist
is going to take over,

870
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:08,628
and that person will perform
an exorcism of the location.

871
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,498
And they will remove him
and send him on his way.

872
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,968
So once all that's taken care
of, I want you to buy a lock

873
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,137
and put it on Layne's closet door.

874
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,940
Putting it on will give
him a sense of empowerment,

875
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:23,042
where he's taking
control of the situation

876
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:27,480
and he's locking them in
there and away from him

877
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:29,782
so they can't invade his space.

878
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:32,051
The other thing is,
is I'll be sending you

879
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:34,687
some guided meditations.

880
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:38,057
And these guided
mediations are very simple

881
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,428
and they are for balancing,
grounding, and protection.

882
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,598
They're so basic, but
they're so important.

883
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,467
He needs to integrate
these into... into his life.

884
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,102
Will he ever have a normal childhood,

885
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:51,571
or is this gonna be something
he's gonna have to deal with?

886
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:54,874
Well, yeah, he's gonna
have to deal with it, like,

887
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:57,210
his whole life.

888
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:58,945
Now Hannelore,

889
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,214
you consider her somebody
that's gonna have abilities,

890
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:03,182
or is she just open because of her age?

891
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:06,252
Right now, it's just because of her age.

892
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:10,156
When might they find out when
If she's gonna be like Layne?

893
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:12,865
Between 5 and 8.

894
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:15,435
At least we'll know how
to handle it, you know,

895
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:17,837
with her, doing it with him.

896
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:20,973
Sounds like a little bit
of work, but I'm on it.

897
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,910
And this solution is
gonna help them both.

898
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:24,977
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

899
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,546
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

900
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:28,214
- No doubts.
- Okay.

901
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:29,515
Mm-hmm.

902
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,218
I really hope Mike and Angie

903
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,821
follow my advice and contact
a male medium and demonologist

904
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:37,256
to remove the dead
terrorizing their family.

905
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:38,324
Once they're gone,

906
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:40,526
Layne can learn to manage his abilities,

907
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,528
and this family will find the peace

908
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,096
they've been searching for.
