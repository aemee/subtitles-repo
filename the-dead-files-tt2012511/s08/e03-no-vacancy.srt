1
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:12,382
There's something dangerous here.

2
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:13,927
And I heard summoning.

3
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:15,729
It's almost like I was possessed.

4
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,262
It scared me, made me jump.

5
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,531
The injuries make him unrecognizable.

6
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:22,434
He's getting his face bashed in.

7
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,735
The tray was just thrown out of my hand.

8
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,768
It would be like
cutting out my own heart.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,904
It's really bad.

10
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:30,605
They're gonna [bleep] kill me.

11
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:33,608
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,744
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,746
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:38,661
They're from hell.

15
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,760
I see dead people.

16
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,028
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,797
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,698
They were setting people on fire,

19
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:45,833
burning them alive.

20
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,334
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:48,636
Her neck got broken.

22
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:51,605
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,607
I hear a gunshot.

24
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,176
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,811
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,646
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:00:58,748 --> 00:00:59,914
Something's not right here.

28
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:02,950
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

29
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,251
It's not safe here.

30
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:05,653
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:07,171
Are any of them buried on the property?

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,189
They're all buried here.

33
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,124
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:12,493
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:13,794
Until the very end...

36
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,095
I can't do it no more.

37
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,697
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,299
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

39
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,000
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:21,469
It does not have a happy ending.

41
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:23,237
Something kills people here.

42
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,452
I'm in Grass Valley, California,

43
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,437
about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento.

44
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,369
I got a call from a guy who
bought an old, historic hotel

45
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,421
and said it was the worst
thing he's ever done.

46
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,107
He says the paranormal
activity there is so bad,

47
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,193
it's attacking his guests,
scaring his employees,

48
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:55,013
and he even blames it
for causing his divorce.

49
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,636
He says if we can't find a solution,

50
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:00,202
he's gonna have to shut the place down.

51
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,369
Before Amy arrives, I clear
the area of any leading information.

52
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,570
Photographs and artwork
can influence her findings,

53
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,839
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

54
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,474
When I'm finished,

55
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,210
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

56
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,821
This town is very active.

57
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,059
Everybody is yelling.

58
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,762
This is a long time ago.

59
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:35,263
Dirt roads.

60
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,499
There were a lot of tragedies here.

61
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:39,801
And people were angry about them.

62
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,237
They're pissed. They're [bleep] pissed.

63
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,072
There's lots of chaos here.

64
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:45,173
Ooh.

65
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,833
Well, Ian, it's good
to finally meet you in person.

66
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,333
When we spoke on the phone,

67
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,652
you sounded like you were at
your wits end with this place.

68
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,204
I still come in
every morning, like,

69
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,439
"What's gonna happen today?"

70
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,641
I've had guests check out
in the middle of the night,

71
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,444
say, "I can't stay
here. It's too scary."

72
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,079
I have employees that are afraid

73
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:09,991
to go to parts of the building alone.

74
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,628
It's stressful.

75
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,096
I'm tired of it.

76
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:15,481
Now, you mentioned on the phone,

77
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,932
there was a lot of activity here.

78
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,651
Give me an idea what
you're talking about.

79
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:20,869
I have people hearing noises.

80
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:24,273
I have objects moving around.

81
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,842
People are being physically touched.

82
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,243
I've even had people say

83
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,270
that they were being sexually assaulted.

84
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,882
- Guests?
- Guests.

85
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,702
It's not just here and
there. It's consistent.

86
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,170
Ian, you mentioned on the phone

87
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,506
that this place may have
even destroyed your marriage.

88
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,630
I mean, what did you mean by that?

89
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,097
After I took over the hotel,

90
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,399
my marriage really
started falling apart.

91
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,268
It changed my personality.

92
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,653
I've talked to people that
have worked here and managed

93
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,772
and owners in the past,

94
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,540
and they said the exact same thing.

95
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,175
It's like, "It ruined my marriage."

96
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:58,211
I feel like there's
something in the air here,

97
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,644
something in the energy.

98
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,945
I see people acting

99
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,714
in ways that they normally
wouldn't be acting.

100
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:04,497
Why are you holding on to this place?

101
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:07,717
You know, I love it. I
still love the Holbrooke.

102
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,186
It's the centerpiece for Grass Valley.

103
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,889
Have you done anything to try
to figure out what's going on?

104
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,441
I've had three different
paranormal groups come in here

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,692
over the last four years.

106
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,962
They had video and audio recording.

107
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,164
What did they tell you?

108
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,832
They say there's a lot of activity,

109
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,101
but no one's ever told me
to do anything about it.

110
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:28,771
They're more interested in
just trying to see what's here.

111
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:29,872
I want some answers.

112
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,408
I don't want to walk
away from this place.

113
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,051
I think there's a living person

114
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,420
that is doing something very bad here.

115
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,601
And I heard summoning.

116
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:45,227
And I do see people doing,

117
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,451
very specifically, EVP stuff.

118
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,703
You mean investigations and stuff?

119
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,088
Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,957
I don't know if they're formal

121
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,994
or just something that
these owners or whoever

122
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,963
are doing on their own time,

123
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,499
but whatever it is,
there's an obsession.

124
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,001
Now I'm hearing obsession.

125
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,543
So, what's going on back here?

126
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,314
My equipment in the
kitchen is always breaking.

127
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,929
We'll buy brand-new equipment.
It will fail within a few weeks.

128
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,263
You sure you don't have an
employee here who's trying

129
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:21,737
to get even with you for
something and breaking [bleep]

130
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:24,821
It's possible, but I've seen
equipment installed myself,

131
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,824
and it's failed with
a week for no reason.

132
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,626
Now, is anything else going on?

133
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,228
I've had furniture move around in rooms.

134
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,396
I was staying in room number 9.

135
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:35,011
Okay.

136
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,907
When I went to bed, I
saw where the chair was.

137
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,176
I got up in the middle of
the night to use the restroom,

138
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,212
the chair had moved to a
completely different spot

139
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:43,414
in the room, and I tripped on it.

140
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,316
- Now, were you alone?
- I was alone.

141
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,368
- You could have broke your neck.
- Yes.

142
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,904
The chair moving in
your bedroom upstairs

143
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,023
when you were staying
over, I can't explain that.

144
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,993
But the rest of this stuff,
the electrical and all that...

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,012
it's an old building. You
think this is all paranormal?

146
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,764
There's no logical explanation

147
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,932
for these events that are happening.

148
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:05,036
I want people to be safe and happy here.

149
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,637
I'm hoping you can help me.

150
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,726
There's an aggressive male here.

151
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,912
He's very, very hyper.

152
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:17,181
And I hear "Paul."

153
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:20,668
I am gonna say that he's mentally ill.

154
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,256
He likes it in here.

155
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,559
It feels more comfortable for him.

156
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,162
He likes little spaces.

157
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,501
He is aggressive,

158
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:40,516
but it's when he feels
like he's being cornered.

159
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,683
He kind of lashes out.

160
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,985
I do see him touching people.

161
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:49,606
The things he'll do
is, like, hiding things,

162
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,359
breaking things, stuff like that.

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,153
So, how long did you work here?

164
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:00,628
Approximately two years.

165
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,862
I was a front desk agent.

166
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:05,998
From my understanding, it
looks like Ian saved this hotel.

167
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,750
How important is that for the city?

168
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,662
It's very important for Grass Valley.

169
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:14,333
The Holbrooke is basically
the heart of this town.

170
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:17,836
There's so much history, and
everybody loves this place.

171
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,606
Ian was telling me that he
thinks whatever's going on here

172
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,275
is responsible for his
marriage breaking up.

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,678
You think whatever's here has
an effect on relationships?

174
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,381
Yes. I've seen a few relationships

175
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,267
that were really,
really strong break up.

176
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,353
There's something here

177
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,524
that doesn't want you to be happy.

178
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,009
Now, when you worked here,
did you have any experiences?

179
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,794
I've actually seen
a shadow figure...

180
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,831
a very tall shadow figure
...ln the kitchen twice.

181
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,098
Now, describe the shadow
figure. How did it look to you?

182
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,683
Tall and dark.

183
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,036
It was definitely taller
than me, over 6 feet tall.

184
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:55,989
And dark... You
couldn't see through it.

185
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,175
Okay, is there anything
else you've experienced?

186
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,677
I couldn't count how
many times this happened,

187
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,824
sitting here at the
front desk, and I would...

188
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,413
hear my name

189
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:08,848
and feel a presence.

190
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,766
And they would, you know, call my name,

191
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,085
and I was, "Can I help... you?

192
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:14,600
Oh, there's nobody there."

193
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
Are you sure it couldn't
have been somebody

194
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:17,801
that came in from outside?

195
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:21,488
Absolutely. No one gets
in without me noticing.

196
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:25,091
- The doors are locked.
- Okay.

197
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,910
There's a woman,

198
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:30,975
and she is a force to be reckoned with.

199
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:37,087
She's in charge, you
know, with an iron fist.

200
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,425
She's trying to talk to people.

201
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,094
It bothers them.

202
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,862
She touches them, and it's burning.

203
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:48,965
It's hot. It's hot. It's so hot.

204
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:52,869
And then she's got, like, this
whole white mist thing going on.

205
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,934
The living see her kind of
as a full-bodied apparition,

206
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,251
sometimes crying, sometimes yelling,

207
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:06,004
and sometimes being very forceful.

208
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,089
What is she trying to tell people?

209
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,842
She's in trouble. She needs help.

210
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,295
So, Andrew, I understand
that you actually work here.

211
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:36,311
Yes, sir. I
used to also live here.

212
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:37,346
- You lived here?
- Yeah.

213
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,114
- For how long?
- For about seven months.

214
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,049
- Okay, what do you do?
- Now I'm maintenance.

215
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,318
I used to do everything
from front desk, night audit,

216
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,620
fill in for bartending.

217
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,605
So you basically know
the whole building.

218
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:47,790
In and out.

219
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,858
Okay. Now, you've
experienced some stuff.

220
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,026
Oh, absolutely, yes.

221
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,411
Okay, what can you tell me?

222
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,297
I've seen shadows and shadow figures,

223
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,933
one with a hat that
was down in the kitchen.

224
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,051
It was a dark figure,

225
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,003
and you could tell there
was something there,

226
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,771
and it scared me. Made me jump,

227
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:06,475
like you or somebody was right
next to me and I didn't know it.

228
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:07,636
And you were alone in the kitchen.

229
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:08,936
Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,171
Okay. Is there anything else going on?

231
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,457
We get a lot of complaints from guests.

232
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:14,658
Okay, like what?

233
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:17,177
I've had guests check out
in the middle of the night,

234
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,163
complaints of noise above their roof

235
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,732
when they're on the top floor,
and there's nobody up there,

236
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:25,152
or the temperatures changing,
or their doorknob keeps rattling.

237
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,171
It's an old building.

238
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,804
I'm sure there's some
quirky things going on,

239
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,537
but that's pretty drastic.

240
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:32,522
I had a family that checked
in about 3:00 in the afternoon,

241
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:34,372
and husband and wife
left the son upstairs

242
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,007
in the room to take a nap.

243
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,659
They were eating downstairs, and
he came barging into the saloon,

244
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,461
asked for the car
key, stayed in the car.

245
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:42,129
He would not come back up to the room.

246
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,564
Did you find out what happened?

247
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,816
We ask him what was going
on. He said he felt something

248
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,402
massaging, like, his legs or his back.

249
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:50,054
And knowing nobody was in the room,

250
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,507
he just jumped up out of the
room and was not going back.

251
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,976
Wow. That would have scared
the hell out of me, I think.

252
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:57,211
It's almost like it's...

253
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,096
malicious in a way.

254
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,666
I think that there's
something dangerous here.

255
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:14,826
And someone's just [bleep] choking bad.

256
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:17,526
There's a guy

257
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,996
strangling a woman

258
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:22,098
with his hand.

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,634
He's, like, just holding her down.

260
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,202
Real strong.

261
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,007
Living people are experiencing this,

262
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:35,995
like, little snippets of past
events all over the place.

263
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,018
Some chick's [bleep] crying.

264
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,320
She had a [bleep] fight with some guy.

265
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:45,855
She's drinking...

266
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,356
morphine.

267
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,558
You know, somebody's who's in this room,

268
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,193
they would hear her crying.

269
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,297
They would hear the pacing, you know?

270
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,616
They would feel like they're
having mental breakdowns.

271
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,875
What's going on?

272
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,795
Whatever is here makes
the living [bleep] insane.

273
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,264
I don't even know how
anyone could stay here.

274
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,350
There are just so many dead.

275
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,190
So, how long you been here?

276
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,423
Over seven years.

277
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,046
Okay, so you were here before
Ian even bought the place?

278
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,528
- Yes.
- Okay.

279
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,280
Any experiences you can't explain?

280
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,782
When I was working graveyard,

281
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,534
I would get up from my
desk and go do something,

282
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,852
and then on my way back,

283
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,772
I would see somebody
sitting in my chair.

284
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,007
So I'd look again, and
they'd be gone, so...

285
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,375
Now, you said you worked
the graveyard shift.

286
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:42,810
Did you have the doors locked?

287
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,646
Yes. I always locked the
doors for my protection.

288
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,781
What about a guest?

289
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,051
No. It was too fast
for it to be a person.

290
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,452
Okay, so, anything else?

291
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,820
I waitress now,

292
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:56,224
and a few times, I would be
walking with the empty tray

293
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,892
going to the dining room,

294
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:02,146
and the tray just, with force,
was just thrown out of my hand.

295
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,931
That's happened three times.

296
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,783
So, where does this usually happen?

297
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,368
Back here in the hallway.

298
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,103
It happened more towards the kitchen.

299
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,405
Did it feel like a hand
came up and smacked it or...

300
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,674
Exactly. It felt like
somebody just went underneath

301
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,810
and just popped it right out of my hand.

302
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,395
Okay. That's interesting.

303
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,080
It scared me.

304
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,404
So, you've had a few
things. Anything else?

305
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:23,755
Yes, I've taken three very
bad falls in this building

306
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,640
since Ian has taken over.

307
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:27,776
I fell out here in the lobby once

308
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:30,145
with a wine glass in
my hand... cut my hand.

309
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,853
Another time, I fell in the kitchen,

310
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:34,489
and that was a hard fall.

311
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,672
I really hurt my hand.

312
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:37,223
I had bruises all over the place.

313
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,292
And then another time, I slipped,

314
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:42,762
and I went and told the cook,
I'm all, "This is dangerous.

315
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,614
It's like ice there," you know?

316
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,899
And he's testing it with his feet,

317
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,968
and he said, "No, it's not.
It's not slippery at all."

318
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,303
That's strange.

319
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,789
These falls, now, is
this uncommon for you?

320
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,507
I've only fallen in here.

321
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,043
I don't usually fall. I'm not clumsy.

322
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,645
I don't know if that's paranormal,

323
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,747
but you've had stuff just
pop out of your hands.

324
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,415
- Right.
- So it's not out of the realm

325
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,701
that somebody may be trying
to make you fall, either.

326
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,536
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

327
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,787
Okay.

328
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,833
This hallway is not a good place to be

329
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,835
if you're a living person.

330
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:24,587
These dead people who have
issues are running amok

331
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:28,942
doing a lot of, like,
weird physical [bleep] here.

332
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:31,144
This is not a good hallway to be in.

333
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,079
It's very bad in here.

334
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,214
Ohh.

335
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,752
I feel sick, sick.

336
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,641
Considering Ian's
owned the hotel for five years,

337
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,574
he really doesn't know much about it.

338
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,409
So I've reached out
to a local historian,

339
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:08,861
who says it's actually a miracle

340
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,279
that the Holbrooke's
still standing today.

341
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,225
So, Hilary, do me a favor.

342
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,527
Will you just start from the
beginning with this place?

343
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,945
When was the hotel built?

344
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,165
It was built in 1851, as
the Golden Gate Saloon.

345
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:27,733
Did it flourish as a saloon?

346
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:28,984
Yes, for several years...

347
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:30,903
until the fire of 1855,

348
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,621
where most of the town was burnt down.

349
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,882
So, what kind of damage are
we talking about in this fire?

350
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,348
- Over 60 acres.
- Wow!

351
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,684
Over 300 buildings were destroyed,

352
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,519
including the Golden Gate Saloon.

353
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,788
Okay, so, obviously, they rebuilt.

354
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,941
Yes. They rebuilt, and then
they added the lot next door,

355
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,793
and they called it the Exchange Hotel.

356
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:49,678
When did it become the Holbrooke Hotel?

357
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:52,097
January 1, 1879.

358
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,349
Daniel and his wife, Ellen, Holbrooke

359
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:56,793
bought the hotel for $12,000.

360
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,433
I have a photo of Daniel Holbrooke.

361
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,482
They renovated it

362
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:05,019
and reopened it as the Holbrooke.

363
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,787
Nothing's really changed.

364
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:09,473
No, that's the nice
thing about that hotel.

365
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,742
So, now they have the hotel.
How's it work out for them?

366
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:14,945
Unfortunately, four years
after they bought it,

367
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:17,314
Daniel Holbrooke passes
away in the hotel.

368
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,432
In the hotel?

369
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,534
Yes, and here's a copy of his obituary.

370
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,497
And they have his funeral at
the hotel a couple days later.

371
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,330
What happens with the hotel?

372
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,874
Well, Ellen takes it
over, and she runs it

373
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,494
for the next 23 years
until her death in 1906.

374
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,413
And I have a copy of her obituary here.

375
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,582
She also dies in the hotel.

376
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,887
Now, you mentioned on the
phone that it was a miracle

377
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,333
that the Holbrooke was
even standing, still.

378
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,449
What did you mean by that?

379
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,467
Well, after that big fire of 1855,

380
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:50,771
there were four more major fires
that devastated Grass Valley...

381
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:53,907
one in 1860, 1862,

382
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,044
1873, and 1896.

383
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,896
But, somehow, the
Holbrooke was left standing.

384
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:01,761
How close of a call
was it for the hotel?

385
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,161
Well, in 1860 and 1873,

386
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:07,031
everything within 100 feet
of the Holbrooke burned down.

387
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,650
So, for some miraculous
reason, this survives.

388
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,435
- Right.
- Okay.

389
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,715
There were a lot of tragedies here,

390
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,882
but then good stuff.

391
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:25,675
Good things coming in waves.

392
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:29,627
So, it's like good, good, good,
and then [bleep] decimation.

393
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:36,067
You know, I'm seeing, like, buildings...

394
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,735
I don't know, burning.

395
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,571
The ground goes under, buckling.

396
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,023
It's [bleep] chaos.

397
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,375
Frankly, I don't know

398
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,744
how there's still, like,
a [bleep] town here.

399
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:53,818
So, you've got a hotel and bar
operating for over 150 years.

400
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:56,220
I got to think there's
some violence there.

401
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,055
I called the Grass Valley police chief,

402
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,757
and he said some cases come to mind

403
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,026
that will definitely
help my investigation.

404
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,702
So, what were
you able to find out?

405
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:14,372
Well, the first mysterious
death was a suicide.

406
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:17,642
And that occurred April 17, 1927.

407
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,211
And the gentleman's name
was John Henry Martin.

408
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:21,979
He was a wealthy miner and a gambler.

409
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:23,347
Okay.

410
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,651
Martin was found here dead in
his hotel room at the Holbrooke.

411
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,419
Do we know how this guy killed himself?

412
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,955
Yes, he slashed his own throat.

413
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,123
That's unusual.

414
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes. Here's a death certificate.

415
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,962
I've been in the business for 34 years,

416
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:41,455
and I've never experienced
anyone cutting their own throat.

417
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,122
- I've seen it once.
- Yeah.

418
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,960
Did we have any idea why he did it?

419
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,396
No. But I do have a
suicide note that he left.

420
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,366
In the note, he says he was
being shadowed and followed.

421
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,285
That's strange. So,
it sounds like this guy

422
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,604
might have been
hallucinating about something.

423
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,022
That's what it appears.

424
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,060
Okay. What else you come up with?

425
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,610
The second one was 1909, and it involved

426
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:10,082
a former bus driver of the
hotel named Cyrus McMath.

427
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,817
- Okay.
- He was downstairs in the bar,

428
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:14,019
drinking one night and very intoxicated,

429
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:17,690
and he got into some kind
of beef with the owner.

430
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,091
Frank DeMaine was his name.

431
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:20,960
He was 76 years old. Here's his picture.

432
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,529
Okay, so this guy's the owner
of the Holbrooke at the time.

433
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,864
Correct.

434
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,832
McMath starts beating DeMaine.

435
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:31,985
And his son, Louis, is upstairs,
hears about this, comes down,

436
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:36,771
and tries to protect his father,
and gets in a fight with McMath.

437
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:40,262
Well, McMath loses,
and he gets pummeled.

438
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:40,855
Really?

439
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:44,423
Witnesses report they can't
even identify who McMath is

440
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:47,660
because the injuries
make him unrecognizable.

441
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:48,994
Okay, so what happens next?

442
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,463
He's still conscious,
and he's taken home,

443
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,683
but he dies shortly thereafter at home.

444
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,525
I'm seeing, like, another guy.

445
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:04,824
He's getting his face bashed in.

446
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:08,851
I'm literally seeing men's boots,

447
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:12,586
the bottom of their shoes,
coming down on my face.

448
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,621
And that hurts.

449
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:18,592
And then these two guys picked me up,

450
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,900
and they're dragging me,
'cause I can't even walk.

451
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,177
This is [bleep] up.

452
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,512
This was creepy.

453
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,946
I'm thinking, "Oh [bleep]
They're gonna [bleep] kill me."

454
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:36,473
If you need us to investigate

455
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:38,673
unexplained activity in your home,

456
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:41,521
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

457
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:43,838
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files" to submit you story,

458
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,106
and we'll help if we can.

459
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:54,338
So far, I've uncovered

460
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:56,422
several deaths inside
my client's property

461
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,655
and multiple fires

462
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,608
that devastated the
city of Grass Valley.

463
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,761
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

464
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,196
Searching through old records,

465
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,571
I find an article about an
exotic dancer named Lola Montez.

466
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:11,138
Turns out she brutally
beat a local newspaper man

467
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,573
inside the hotel.

468
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:18,262
I'm on my way to meet
with a local author

469
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:20,548
who said Lola Montez traveled the world,

470
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,184
and wherever she went,
violence followed her.

471
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,657
So, Chris, you mentioned on the phone

472
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,812
this Lola Montez was quite a character.

473
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,023
But let me ask you a question.
Was she from Grass Valley?

474
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,122
She was not.

475
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:39,393
She was born in Ireland
between 1818 and 1821,

476
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,245
and she was raised in India.

477
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,997
She was quite beautiful
from a very young age.

478
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,302
She becomes this great dancer by
the time she's 17, 18 years old,

479
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,889
and starts to develop what we
know as the spider dance today.

480
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,741
Okay, so, what the
hell is a spider dance?

481
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,610
Part ballet, part interpretive dance,

482
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:59,396
pretending as though she
was caught in a spider web.

483
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,315
And as she's spun around,

484
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,268
the opportunity to be
able to see some thigh

485
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:07,438
or maybe the dress coming up a
little bit higher than the thigh

486
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:09,356
was something that was very real

487
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:11,230
and the audience thought was risque.

488
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,581
And, certainly, men
would come to see this.

489
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,835
Lola Montez's dance is so titillating

490
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,304
that she gains the attention

491
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,573
of King Ludwig of Bavaria.

492
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,274
He takes her as his mistress.

493
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:27,925
She takes over pretty much politically

494
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,477
and kind of masterminds

495
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:32,146
what he should be doing
within the government.

496
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,881
And she's a young kid at this time.

497
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:36,317
Right. Got a photo here of her.

498
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:39,336
I mean, she was a stunning lady.

499
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,672
So, how does she end up in Grass Valley?

500
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:45,843
Well, after a relationship with
the king of Bavaria went bad,

501
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:49,163
she left Europe and came to America

502
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,048
and traveled around quite extensively,

503
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:54,418
and ends up in the gold country,
because there's a lot of gold

504
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,986
and a lot of money to be made here.

505
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,238
All right, Chris. So, how does
she wind up at the Holbrooke

506
00:22:58,338 --> 00:22:59,371
giving this guy a beating?

507
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:02,140
She performs at the Holbrooke.

508
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,341
And Henry Shipley,

509
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,777
who is a newspaperman
here in the gold country...

510
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:06,845
Okay.

511
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,847
And he has been reprinting articles

512
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:12,317
that are very bad about Lola Montez.

513
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:16,388
And so she trots on
down to the Holbrooke

514
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,391
and takes a bull whip out

515
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:22,227
and gives him four
lashes across the face.

516
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:23,628
Wow. Okay.

517
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:26,965
The beating made national news.

518
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,667
All right, so, what
happens to this guy Shipley?

519
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:32,244
He never does get over being
humiliated by Lola Montez.

520
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,011
He ends up in Sacramento.

521
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,947
He drinks himself to death, literally,

522
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,751
because he downs a whole
bottle of strychnine.

523
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,253
- Okay, so, he commits suicide.
- He does.

524
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,922
So, what happened with Lola?

525
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,842
Lola dies in 1861 in
New York in her late 30s,

526
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,527
and she's impoverished.

527
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:58,178
I'm seeing the woman who
rules with the iron fist again.

528
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,162
Out there,

529
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,582
she was very overwhelming
in her energy...

530
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,412
like bigger-than-life
kind of person.

531
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,464
It seems she's crying.

532
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,868
Somebody says she was
tormenting herself.

533
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:20,504
She's a mess.

534
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,406
Obviously, something happened.

535
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,759
There's a male.

536
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:28,145
Oh, had to put her in her place.

537
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,030
Too big for her britches.

538
00:24:30,116 --> 00:24:34,451
It was because she really
was, like, too powerful.

539
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:39,289
People really, like, listened to her,

540
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:42,626
and people respected her.

541
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,661
There's something with
the right of her head.

542
00:24:44,764 --> 00:24:46,196
Man...

543
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,898
Right side...

544
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:51,034
Yeah, I think these guys
really [bleep] with her, man.

545
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,504
I saw dozens of dead
people during my walk.

546
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:01,562
But the group harassing
the living in the hallway

547
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:03,214
had me the most concerned.

548
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:09,419
There was a man on the left

549
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,489
who was, like, climbing up the wall.

550
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:15,359
And then there was
some crazy-looking woman

551
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:18,195
standing in front of the door.

552
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:22,666
Another guy was charging towards me.

553
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,005
Amy, is this what you saw?

554
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,940
Yes, this is what I saw.

555
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,329
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

556
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:54,162
we're ready to reveal our findings

557
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,698
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

558
00:25:57,488 --> 00:26:00,422
Well, Amy, this is a very
special investigation.

559
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:02,141
This hotel is the heart of the city,

560
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,759
but because of the activity here,

561
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,028
it's in danger of
shutting down for good.

562
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,732
Now, for the past five years,
Ian has owned and run the hotel,

563
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,500
but he can't go on like this.

564
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,369
Terri has worked here for seven years.

565
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,738
She's had a lot of experiences.

566
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,908
The same with Kelly. She's a
local who used to work here,

567
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,261
but she considers the
Holbrooke a home away from home.

568
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,929
So, now that I told Amy

569
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,498
just a little bit about
what's going on with you guys,

570
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,751
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

571
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,790
When I got here,
I was seeing the town

572
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:39,145
being decimated over
and over and over again,

573
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,380
almost like it came in waves.

574
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,501
And I saw people coming,
and that was good.

575
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,671
Like, people were
excited. They're happy.

576
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:50,339
It would be built up,

577
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:54,277
and then it would just
be, like, decimated.

578
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,846
And then there was fire.

579
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,833
The ground was, like,
sinking or something.

580
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,079
Well, it's probably a good time

581
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,262
to give you a little
history about Grass Valley.

582
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,649
In the mid-1800s, this town
was the heart of the gold rush,

583
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,951
and people were coming
from all over the world

584
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,786
looking for fortune.

585
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:13,038
Now, in 1851,

586
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:16,424
this place was opened up
as the Golden Gate Saloon.

587
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:17,842
Now, just four years later,

588
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,513
a huge fire ripped through this town.

589
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:22,764
The building was burned to the ground.

590
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,450
But when it was rebuilt,
it was rebuilt as the hotel.

591
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:30,338
Now, in 1860, 1862, 1873,

592
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:33,325
huge fires leveled this town again...

593
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,876
destroying just about everything.

594
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:36,044
Okay.

595
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,245
Amazingly, though,

596
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:40,298
the hotel survived each
of those other times.

597
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,101
1879, a couple named Holbrooke

598
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,538
brought the hotel and
named it after themselves.

599
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,858
Now, I got a picture of it back then.

600
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,410
1896, there was another fire,

601
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:54,713
and the Holbrooke was
one of the only buildings

602
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,399
- left standing again.
- Hmm.

603
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:59,818
I didn't know about
all the fire history.

604
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:02,687
It sounds like this hotel is a survivor,

605
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:04,356
but there's something here.

606
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,394
When I walked
in, I was overwhelmed.

607
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,262
Obviously, there's a lot of dead here.

608
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:12,597
Now, I'm on the main floor,

609
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:15,967
and I went into the long peach hallway.

610
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:18,620
That was probably not a good place

611
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,708
for living people to be in...

612
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:25,727
because there are a lot of
dead people in that hallway.

613
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:27,279
Some of the other dead

614
00:28:27,364 --> 00:28:31,216
have put these different
dead people in there.

615
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:34,987
The reason why they're
put in that hallway

616
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:39,024
is because they're mentally unstable.

617
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:41,312
So, let me get this straight.
The normal dead people

618
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,332
are putting the nutty
dead people in a corner.

619
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,467
- Yes.
- Wow.

620
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,625
Because they're mentally unstable,

621
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,845
the living might have
some experiences there,

622
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:56,200
like seeing, perhaps,
like, dark shadows,

623
00:28:56,335 --> 00:29:00,604
feeling movement,
possibly feeling touched.

624
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,042
When I was walking through the
hallway, I usually carry a tray.

625
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:09,329
And the tray was knocked out of my hand.

626
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,981
I had it up like this,

627
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:16,336
and I felt as if somebody
just pushed it up,

628
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,355
and it just toppled out of my hand.

629
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,858
And that's happened to
me three times, so...

630
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,630
Okay.

631
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,681
And it's always been right
there in that hallway, so...

632
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,532
You know where that hallway leads?

633
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:28,584
That leads to my office.

634
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,937
There's something
about the feeling there.

635
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:32,855
When I first took the hotel over,

636
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,159
within 48 hours,

637
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,778
the ceiling collapsed in that office.

638
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,196
That's kind of weird.

639
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:41,664
And then now I'm wondering

640
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,518
if there's something more going on.

641
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:48,688
I did a sketch of what I saw.

642
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:59,165
I mean, it looks like
a scene from a mental ward.

643
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,136
Oh, my!

644
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,958
I can't believe I have
to walk through that

645
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:10,160
20 times a day.

646
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:18,890
I can't believe that they
were here when I worked here.

647
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:27,076
There's times when I feel anxious,

648
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:29,882
like energy is being sucked out of me.

649
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,316
That makes sense,

650
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:34,954
because the other thing that I
got was a sense of extreme panic

651
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:37,288
and feeling overwhelmed with anxiety.

652
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:41,041
I've been being treated
for anxiety and depression.

653
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:42,593
Mm.

654
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:51,218
That's something that can
happen from being here.

655
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:54,305
I have a huge investment
here, inside of me.

656
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,639
It's a huge investment.

657
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,641
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

658
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,393
That's tough, yeah.

659
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:03,848
Anything else?

660
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,942
There was some other
weird guy, a dead guy.

661
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,208
His name is Paul.

662
00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:10,493
And one of the places he likes a lot

663
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:14,814
is the storage area in the kitchen.

664
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,617
I think he might have had

665
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:21,521
some mental illness, as well.

666
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,993
He'll lash out and touch people.

667
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:29,796
He'll take things. He'll hide things.

668
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:34,817
<i>He would like to burn things
and/or has burned things.</i>

669
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,736
And from what you were telling me,

670
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:39,739
now I'm kind of concerned that
he's a little bit more dangerous

671
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:44,093
than what I initially
assessed about him.

672
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:49,032
His main goal is to
get rid of the living.

673
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,984
I mean, the guy she's describing

674
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,519
doesn't match up with anybody
I found in my research,

675
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,971
but a lot of what you're saying

676
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,091
matches up with what
they're experiencing.

677
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:01,127
At first, I thought it was
just I was kind of losing it.

678
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,530
I mean, honestly, it
doesn't make any sense.

679
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,180
Stuff will go missing all the time.

680
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,383
Now, you said
this guy can get physical.

681
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,918
Terri, tell Amy about
the falls you've taken.

682
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,987
Once was out here in the lobby,

683
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,039
but in the kitchen both other times.

684
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,541
Yeah, I was pretty bruised up.

685
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,810
I still have pain from that fall.

686
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,699
The next thing
that I saw was a female.

687
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:27,735
And she was in charge here,

688
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:32,156
and she ran this with,
like, an iron fist.

689
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:36,327
In life, people listened to her,
and she was very influential.

690
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,231
And men here did not like this.

691
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,633
They wanted to put her in her place.

692
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:45,703
There were a couple of
men, very specific men,

693
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:48,322
one Hank and one Gerald,

694
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:51,075
that really had big issues with her.

695
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:55,313
There was a lot of pain in her head.

696
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:57,648
I think that occasionally,

697
00:32:57,784 --> 00:33:02,820
she might look like a fawn apparition.

698
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:04,322
And she tries to talk to people,

699
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,257
and when she's trying to talk to them,

700
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:09,477
they'll feel heat, and
they'll get very hot.

701
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:12,413
So, Kelly, didn't you have
voices trying to talk to you?

702
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,799
At the front desk.

703
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,384
I've heard my name called,

704
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:18,653
just walking through the
hall, and I hear my name.

705
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:22,040
And I ask everybody who called
my name, but nobody knows.

706
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,442
- That happens to you, too?
- Quite often.

707
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:27,040
It may be a shot in the dark,
but a woman did come across

708
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,541
in my research that could
possibly fit the bill,

709
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,544
a woman by the name of Lola Montez.

710
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,848
Now, she was probably one of
the most fascinating characters

711
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,917
I've ever come across in my research.

712
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:44,038
She was born in Ireland
between 1818 and maybe 1821.

713
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,706
Nobody's really sure.

714
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,142
By the time she was 16,
she was a famous dancer.

715
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,611
She became very famous throughout Europe

716
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,615
and had tons of
high-profile men after her.

717
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,100
She wound up coming here to America

718
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:58,870
and ended up dancing
here at the Holbrooke.

719
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,637
Now, you mention a guy named Hank.

720
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:05,792
Well, a guy named Henry
Shipley wrote articles about her

721
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:09,329
in the local newspaper
that weren't very nice.

722
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,131
She didn't take this too well.

723
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:15,718
She came right here in
this saloon and whipped him.

724
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,037
- Oh, goodness!
- I got an article here about it.

725
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:22,425
Now, she caught him four times
across the face with this whip.

726
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:25,345
Holy

727
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:28,581
This guy was so embarrassed
by what happened to him

728
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,151
that he eventually committed suicide.

729
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:32,986
That's how embarrassed he was by it.

730
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,821
Oh, wow! What...

731
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:36,356
Wow.

732
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,425
I've got a photo of her.

733
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:44,931
Is it possible that might
be who you might have seen?

734
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,267
Actually, yeah.

735
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:52,105
I feel very connected to this person.

736
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,273
I don't know.

737
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,742
Maybe that's why this place
is my home away from home.

738
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,180
So, what else?

739
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,191
When I was upstairs,

740
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:07,610
I encountered a lot
of residual information

741
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:11,480
and a lot of different dead people.

742
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:14,250
I went into one room, and I saw a male

743
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:18,688
trying to strangle a
woman with his bare hands.

744
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,206
And then I saw, unfortunately,
another woman in a room

745
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:25,841
drinking some morphine.

746
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,277
You know, finally, I just
kind of had to just stop,

747
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:30,146
because it was just too much.

748
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:35,441
Living people would go through,
possibly seeing some of the dead

749
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,593
walking through their rooms at night.

750
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:40,262
Also, people might feel really dizzy.

751
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,532
I was getting that consistently
through the building.

752
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,736
And some people, obviously,
might have physical experiences.

753
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:48,923
So, Amy, obviously,

754
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,872
we're getting to the
heart of why we're here,

755
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,207
and the problem with the hotel.

756
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,276
The upstairs is obviously
where the guests stay.

757
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,744
Yeah, one gentleman

758
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,930
was in room number 3, laying in his bed,

759
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,516
and he said just, suddenly,

760
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,235
there's a whirlwind...

761
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,405
with all the windows
closed, doors closed.

762
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,207
He came down here. He
was white as a ghost.

763
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:13,595
He said, "I'm leaving. This
place has got problems."

764
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,715
I spoke to one of the employees
who saw a kid run out of here.

765
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,134
It turned out the kid felt
like he was being massaged

766
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,204
by something on the bed,
which was kind of freaky.

767
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,255
Wow.

768
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,924
This place is pretty damn active.

769
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,194
How would being around all
these dead people in this place

770
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:30,996
affect somebody like Ian and Terri

771
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:32,414
that are here all the time?

772
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,500
That exposure over a long period of time

773
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:39,337
would cause some...

774
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:43,008
emotional and mental
disorders to develop.

775
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,627
Employees could suffer breakdowns,

776
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:50,118
and then some physically
could be harmed.

777
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,328
Not good.

778
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:54,206
You told me you thought this
place destroyed your marriage.

779
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,839
I think it had a big, big hand...

780
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:56,907
Hmm.

781
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,625
In my breakup of my marriage.

782
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,176
It's changed my personality.

783
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:05,966
It came down to a point where
I was very short-tempered.

784
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:09,234
I had a relationship with
someone who worked here,

785
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:12,270
and...

786
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,721
he changed.

787
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:17,158
The relationship went to crap.

788
00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:19,193
Does what they're
saying make sense to you?

789
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,646
Yeah.

790
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:24,866
I've done a lot of hotels.

791
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:30,421
Maybe 5% are as active as this.

792
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,625
I don't want you to lose your sanity,

793
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,959
and I don't want to lose mine,

794
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:37,609
but I think that if we
give up on the Holbrooke,

795
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,825
then we'll be giving
up on the entire town.

796
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:57,605
So, Ian, now we know

797
00:37:57,705 --> 00:38:00,681
why your employees have been
so scared to be here alone.

798
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,981
We know why your guests

799
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,849
have been checking out
in the middle of the night

800
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,085
and why your relationships
are falling apart.

801
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,369
But we still don't know

802
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:10,990
if you can safely keep
the Holbrooke's doors open.

803
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:15,227
So, for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

804
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,414
Sometimes, there are places

805
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:22,067
that are just

806
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,938
so extremely active

807
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,575
that, literally, it would take

808
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,730
a town of various practitioners

809
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,966
and many years

810
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:43,989
to completely cleanse
and remove the dead

811
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:46,542
and the residual energy.

812
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,129
This is one of those places.

813
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,099
And I know it's not really
what y'all want to hear.

814
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,734
It sounds like you're saying

815
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,469
they can't get rid of the dead here.

816
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:01,256
Frankly, it would take, really, years.

817
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,745
That's not at all what I expected,

818
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,013
to be honest with you.

819
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:13,018
No. Not at all what I expected to hear.

820
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,536
Here's the thing.

821
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:17,723
Typically, what ends up happening

822
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,658
to these kinds of places

823
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:23,529
is that, kind of, the
dead win in the end.

824
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,682
Most of the locations
that have been like this

825
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,952
either end up getting torn down,

826
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,737
or they sit vacant.

827
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,340
They're, like, literally
run out of business.

828
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,443
Yeah, I mean, that's just not an option.

829
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,161
I got to come up with something.

830
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,013
I got to keep this place open.

831
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,048
It actually is kind
of breaking my heart.

832
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:46,435
She's like another one of my kids.

833
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:51,023
I have never felt as strong
about a place in my life.

834
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:52,291
That's horrible.

835
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,510
I mean, I've got to come
up with an option here

836
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,229
to make this place
successful for the town.

837
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:59,665
If this were my
place, I would leave,

838
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,685
because there's nothing you
can do to make it totally safe.

839
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,971
But if you're really determined to stay,

840
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:09,808
there are things that you can do

841
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,579
to protect yourselves.

842
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,298
Here's a bag of black salt.

843
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,749
Take some of this,

844
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:20,786
sprinkle it in approximately
the four corners of the building.

845
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,838
And what that's gonna do is just kind of

846
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:26,859
build an energetic wall of purity

847
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:31,380
to keep the dead out.

848
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:35,934
The other thing is is to utilize stones.

849
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,054
Okay, we have black tourmaline,
and we have selenite.

850
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,057
It protects you
specifically from the dead.

851
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:44,426
You would carry those stones all day.

852
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,677
Here's the problem.

853
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:48,147
None of them are long-lasting,

854
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:52,467
so this would be a daily type of ritual.

855
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:53,952
So, what are you gonna do?

856
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,988
Well, I'm gonna take
precautions, to start with.

857
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,422
I'm not gonna give up.

858
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:01,894
My concern is for the living here

859
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:06,031
who are consistently here
and your mental well-being,

860
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,568
because I've seen people,

861
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,770
you know, undertake tasks like this

862
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:16,241
and kind of self-destruct.

863
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,377
Instead of the building being torn down,

864
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:21,029
<i>you might be torn down.</i>

865
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:24,333
This place being boarded
up would be a travesty.

866
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,234
I'm gonna give it a
good, good try, anyway,

867
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:29,253
- the old college try.
- Yeah. Good.

868
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:34,108
I wish I had better news for Ian.

869
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,144
The dead inside this hotel would
literally take years to remove.

870
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:40,126
But with the precautions I gave him,

871
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:42,006
Ian will at least have
a fighting chance

872
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:44,191
of keeping the doors
of his hotel open.
