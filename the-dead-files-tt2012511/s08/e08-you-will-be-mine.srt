1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,334
Her face was all, like, demonic.

2
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:15,169
I felt hands yank me up.

3
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,504
Yeah, so, the way
she's trying to kill her

4
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:19,006
is try to get her to kill herself.

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,742
Bodies were starting to float ashore

6
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:23,110
up and down this entire area.

7
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,413
There is a lot of dead around.

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,782
She died in a fire.

9
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:29,850
How do you know that, honey?

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,418
She told me.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,220
And it killed... I think
it killed everybody.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,663
The dead girl...
she's always watching.

13
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:39,464
There's a dark presence.

14
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,600
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:43,602
These things, they're freaking out.

16
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:45,003
They're from hell.

17
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:46,104
I see dead people.

18
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:47,372
They were being hunted.

19
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:49,140
I speak to dead people.

20
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:51,042
They were setting people on fire,

21
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:52,177
burning them alive.

22
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,678
And they speak to me.

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,980
Her neck got broken.

24
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,949
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

25
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,951
I hear a gunshot.

26
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,519
I rely on my partner.

27
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:02,654
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

28
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,823
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

29
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,057
Something's not right here.

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,427
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

31
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,595
It's not safe here.

32
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:11,696
It's my job to reveal them.

33
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:13,265
Are any of them buried on the property?

34
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,399
They're all buried here.

35
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:16,868
But Steve and I never speak...

36
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,904
We never communicate
during an investigation.

37
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,305
Until the very end...

38
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,606
I can't do it no more.

39
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,642
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

40
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:24,912
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

41
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,378
Or time to get out.

42
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,846
It does not have a happy ending.

43
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:30,115
Something kills people here.

44
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm in the seaside
town of North Beach, Maryland.

45
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,436
It's about 45 minutes
south of Annapolis.

46
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:53,238
I got a call from a
woman who was hysterical.

47
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,973
She says whatever's in the house

48
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,608
is attacking her
6- year-old daughter.

49
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:59,345
She thinks the little girl is in danger,

50
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,447
and she can't think of
anywhere else to turn.

51
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,183
She says we're literally her last hope.

52
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:12,802
Before Amy arrives,

53
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,971
I clear the area of
any leading information,

54
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:17,473
removing religious
symbols, family photos,

55
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:21,010
and other personal items that
could influence her findings.

56
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:25,548
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

57
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:37,783
Okay.

58
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:44,022
There's, like, a lot of darkness here.

59
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:48,594
Even if the sun is shining,
it's not really shining.

60
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,563
It's, like, stormy and dark,

61
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,367
and there's all of
these unresolved issues.

62
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,870
There's a lot of fighting.

63
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,640
There's a lot of dead around.

64
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,288
Caren, when
we spoke on the phone,

65
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,354
you were pretty upset

66
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,122
about what's going on in the house.

67
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,056
Yes.

68
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:18,891
Most people think I'm crazy,

69
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,660
but it's hard to do battle

70
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:22,695
with an enemy you don't understand.

71
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,430
Okay.

72
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,900
Give me a list of what you
guys are experiencing here.

73
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,236
There are things
moving around the house.

74
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,738
We're hearing voices.

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
We have all had nightmares.

76
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:36,008
We've seen full apparitions.

77
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,378
Now things are getting physical.

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,079
Now, who's living in
the house here with you?

79
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,650
My oldest daughter, Laurel, who's 14,

80
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:47,275
my middle daughter, Aspen, who's 8,

81
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,510
and my youngest
daughter, Cedar, who is 6.

82
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,445
We spoke on the phone.
I know you're married.

83
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:55,548
Yes, my husband works for
the Department of Defense,

84
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,251
and he travels a lot,
so he's rarely here.

85
00:03:58,353 --> 00:03:59,385
Okay.

86
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,855
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

87
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:04,891
I know the owner that we
bought the property from.

88
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:07,260
She was an older lady. She had polio.

89
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,028
Okay. So when did you
move here, exactly?

90
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,865
We bought the property in 2007.

91
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,499
And did you guys have experiences

92
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:15,001
from the minute you moved in?

93
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,336
No.

94
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,037
For some reason,

95
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,741
things started happening
once Cedar turned 3.

96
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,511
Let's talk about her. What's going on?

97
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,913
She has drawn pictures.

98
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:27,780
What kind of pictures?

99
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,110
I have some right here.

100
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,643
And this is the man with the brown arms.

101
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:34,313
He lives in her room, in her closet.

102
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,647
Oh, geez. All right.

103
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:37,816
This one she saw in my bathroom.

104
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:39,117
It was a man covered with mud.

105
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,022
And I have a book with over 40 drawings.

106
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:46,625
She has become anxious and depressed.

107
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,428
We've seen psychiatrists
and psychologists.

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,197
They all say she's a normal little girl,

109
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,433
but she says things

110
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:57,369
that 5- and 6-year-old
children should not be saying.

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,373
Thank you. I'm sorry. No, don't be.

112
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,550
I love her with all
my heart, but at times,

113
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,186
I just... I don't
know who she is.

114
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,706
This is pretty... heavy.

115
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,539
How are you handling it?

116
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:14,907
Not very well.

117
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,977
When I'm alone, I do a lot of crying.

118
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,948
I feel isolated. I feel exhausted.

119
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,179
How are the other two kids handling

120
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,812
all this stuff that
you and her, you know?

121
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:28,950
There's a lot of fighting, a
lot of blaming, blaming her.

122
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,519
"It's your fault this is all going on."

123
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:37,291
So it's a very hard
environment to live in at times.

124
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:40,995
I feel so upset for you and
what you're going through.

125
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,164
We're willing to do whatever it takes.

126
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,665
We're ready.

127
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:48,002
Okay.

128
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:51,572
I just hear crying and crying.

129
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,776
I don't think that people around here

130
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:58,613
can really maintain good
family relationships.

131
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:04,185
The fighting is huge... a
huge, huge, huge problem.

132
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:07,321
Oh, oh.

133
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:10,958
There's a male. He's all dark right now.

134
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,528
He's, like, standing in the shadows.

135
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,962
He's very angry.

136
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,597
Yeah, this is bad.

137
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,438
Why'd you bring me in here?

138
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,706
The day that I talked
to you on the phone,

139
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,276
only a couple hours later,
I was in the kitchen.

140
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:32,880
And I opened the cupboard,
and before doing anything,

141
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:37,084
all the dishes and the
bowls fell on top of me.

142
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,520
Was this here? Yes.

143
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:40,822
And these support clips were here?

144
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:41,622
Yes.

145
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,024
Well, I can't figure out

146
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,358
what the hell would have did that.

147
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:46,727
Has anything else in this
kitchen happened here?

148
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,230
Yes. My daughter Laurel
and I were right here,

149
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,200
having a conversation,
and all of a sudden,

150
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:54,202
she screamed, and I said,

151
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,336
"What's wrong? What's wrong?"

152
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,405
She said, "Someone just
touched me on my back,"

153
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,540
and there was no one else in the room.

154
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:03,878
It was just her and I.

155
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,280
Okay. There's something creepy.

156
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:09,283
I'm thinking maybe
it came out of the TV.

157
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,559
There's this, like, woman.
She had, like, long hair.

158
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:16,825
She was all wet.

159
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,827
Her face was all, like, demonic.

160
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,562
But she's young. I know she's young.

161
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:25,066
And there's a relationship
with a living woman,

162
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:28,103
probably like my age, maybe.

163
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,839
Something weird is
going on with these two.

164
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:36,945
The dead girl... she's always
watching, always watching.

165
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,916
People would see her moving.

166
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,018
As a woman? What
do you think they see?

167
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:50,091
More along the lines of
like a shadowy figure.

168
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:53,995
This girl's just messed up.
Her head is just messed up.

169
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:56,064
Oh, this isn't good.

170
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,638
What's going on in here?

171
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,142
I have had several scary
experiences in this room.

172
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,777
I was woken by a noise, and immediately,

173
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:17,949
I looked to the door and
saw a giant black shadow

174
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,385
coming at me from the door.

175
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:24,190
Came over the bed and came
straight overtop of me.

176
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:25,698
I was scared to death.

177
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,198
I've never been that scared in my life.

178
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,766
What else is happening up here?

179
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:29,867
I was asleep,

180
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,538
and I felt a hand grab
my hair and yank me up.

181
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,898
It was a very aggressive pull.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,065
I screamed,

183
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,801
and I did not go back
to sleep after that.

184
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:41,768
There was no one around.

185
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,869
Tim wasn't here.

186
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,204
You're sure it wasn't
a nightmare that you...

187
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,972
It was not a nightmare.

188
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,274
How the hell are you dealing with this?

189
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,309
I don't sleep most nights,

190
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:52,345
but I'm glad that I had the experience.

191
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:53,049
Why?

192
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,816
Because I understand what
Cedar's going through.

193
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,785
If I saw that every night,

194
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,386
I think I'd act like her, too.

195
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,093
I hear "mother."

196
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:07,695
This is weird.

197
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:14,879
This dead girl feels like the
living woman here is her mother.

198
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,215
Okay. Oh, boy.

199
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:27,929
The feeling in here is loss
and loneliness, isolation,

200
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:32,239
extremely depressed,
like there's nothing left.

201
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,340
Okay.

202
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:36,409
She wants this woman all to herself,

203
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:40,614
and she's doing everything in
her power to make that happen.

204
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:41,548
Aah!

205
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,021
So, that was a warning.

206
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:49,489
What happened?

207
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,191
She kind of hit me in my neck.

208
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:54,352
At least I know I'm on
the right track with this.

209
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,754
The dead younger woman is
trying to kill the living woman

210
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:01,157
because she wants to be with her.

211
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,116
I was talking to your daughter.

212
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,315
I got to tell you,

213
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,176
listening to her talk about
what's going on with Cedar,

214
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,842
that really broke my heart.

215
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,578
Absolutely. Something's
going on with Cedar.

216
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,414
She's changed dramatically

217
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:32,983
in the last year, year and a half.

218
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:36,720
To do this to my
grandchildren makes me angry.

219
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:37,687
You spend time here, I guess.

220
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:38,955
- Lots of time here.
- You do?

221
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,190
We live right down the street.

222
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,725
Have you experienced anything?

223
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,693
My husband and I
were babysitting here.

224
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,185
Okay.

225
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:48,565
And we heard Cedar cry
out, yelling and screaming,

226
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,934
"Stop it, stop it. Leave
me alone, leave me alone."

227
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:56,840
So I rubbed her back, and
she went back into her sleep,

228
00:10:56,942 --> 00:11:00,643
and then I heard a low voice say,

229
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,513
"It's gonna be all
right. It's all right."

230
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,783
Okay. Do you remember if it
was a male or a female voice?

231
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:09,019
- It sounded male.
- Okay.

232
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:11,359
What are you hoping to get
out of this investigation?

233
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,648
I've thought long and hard about this,

234
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,350
and peace among the girls.

235
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,486
They don't tend to get along,

236
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:21,522
and it's more than just sibling rivalry.

237
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:22,957
There's something else.

238
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,159
Do you think they're
in physical danger here?

239
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,961
Yes, I do.

240
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,367
The dead younger woman...

241
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:39,540
she is coming in, being
creepy and malicious.

242
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:45,079
I think it's out of jealousy
because she wants Mommy.

243
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,482
She doesn't want children to distract.

244
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,888
But, okay, so, the
interesting thing is...

245
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,257
the dead guy who was in
the shadows downstairs

246
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,258
just came in.

247
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,060
He wants to stop.

248
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:04,065
This is completely uncalled for,
and it's disgusting, he says.

249
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:08,335
He's trying to reach the kids.

250
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:12,267
He's trying to communicate with them,

251
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,037
and he's trying to make them listen,

252
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,273
and he's trying to teach them
how to stay away from her.

253
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,912
So he is requesting that
God put a stop to this.

254
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,087
So, Cedar, I
was talking to Mommy,

255
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:33,122
and she told me that
she's worried about you.

256
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:37,126
Okay. She says sometimes
you get angry at things.

257
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:38,961
Do you recall any of that stuff?

258
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:39,996
You remember that?

259
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,298
Why do you think that happens, honey?

260
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,599
I don't want to get angry.

261
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,001
You don't want to get angry.

262
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:47,670
- All of a sudden, you get angry.
- Okay.

263
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,273
Okay, would you mind telling
me about what you're seeing?

264
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,709
I had, like, this dream last night.

265
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,410
I was going to Mom's room,

266
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,845
and there was blood on the floor,

267
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:58,781
and there was dead
people there...

268
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,752
a man, there was a woman,
and there was a little girl.

269
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,188
I was so freaked out. I didn't like it.

270
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,390
Okay. So, what else are
you seeing, sweetheart?

271
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:14,030
He yells at me.

272
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:15,531
When he yells at you,
what's he tell you?

273
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:18,534
He says, "Get out of here.

274
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,003
<i>This is not your room. This is my room."</i>

275
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,741
Okay. He sounds very mean.

276
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:27,376
We're gonna have to straighten
him out and get rid of him.

277
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,011
Okay, anything else, honey?

278
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:32,081
I looked over, and,
like, this little girl...

279
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:33,883
her name's Stacie...
she was hitting me.

280
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,319
So, this little girl, is she a spirit,

281
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:37,487
or is she a real person?

282
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:38,755
She's a spirit.

283
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:41,991
I know how she died. She died in a fire.

284
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,092
How do you know that, honey?

285
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:45,795
- 'Cause she told me.
- She did?

286
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:47,096
Where does she hit you?

287
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:49,866
She, like, hits me all
here and here and here.

288
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:50,900
Okay.

289
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:53,369
And do you get her to stop somehow?

290
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,538
- No, I can't.
- You can't, huh?

291
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,574
'Cause when I tell her stop,
she just keeps on doing it.

292
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:01,677
Okay. We're gonna try to
get rid of her, too, okay?

293
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,514
Would that make you happy?

294
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:06,482
Okay.

295
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,885
The living person in this room

296
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,920
can hear the dead man talking to them.

297
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:13,843
So the person
in here is aware of him?

298
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,143
Like, I don't know if
it's through dreams.

299
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,444
I don't know if it's
direct communication.

300
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,980
I don't know, but on some level,

301
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,884
yes, very much so, they've talked.

302
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,620
The dead younger woman,
she does come in here.

303
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:27,421
Boy, does she.

304
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:29,022
She has to try harder here,

305
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:32,726
'cause the protection
seems more aggressive.

306
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,762
She's more visual here.

307
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:37,898
She manifests here.

308
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,935
She is louder here because
she can't get close.

309
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,145
So, Aspen,
sweetie, how old are you?

310
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:53,681
- 8 years old.
- You're 8, huh?

311
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,350
Now, Mommy also said that
you're seeing things, as well.

312
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,351
Mm-hmm.

313
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,854
There is a shadow man in my room.

314
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:04,658
He sits there, over by that dresser.

315
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,627
What did it look like? Did
it look like a grown person?

316
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:10,839
Yeah, it looked like a grown-up,
and it was like a person.

317
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:11,891
Okay.

318
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,334
And he just sits staring and looks at me

319
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,236
and maybe watches out for me.

320
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,404
Okay, so that's one
thing you've experienced.

321
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:18,472
What else has happened?

322
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:19,874
Well, I was in bed,

323
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:24,044
and then I saw a little
girl over by my ribbons.

324
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,580
She had brown hair, and she
was looking out the window,

325
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,830
and she was twirling her
hair, and she was wet.

326
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,329
- She was wet?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,598
Maybe she was about to go to sleep,

328
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,634
but she was in the water or something.

329
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,302
Okay. Anything else, honey?

330
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:41,940
I was in my bed, and
then, all of a sudden,

331
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:47,312
I felt a thumb press on the
back of my neck really hard.

332
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,756
Okay. Were any
of the animals...

333
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,155
your dogs in the house in bed with you

334
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:51,657
or anything like that?

335
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,574
No. The dogs weren't in bed with me.

336
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,706
Oh. Sounds like you got
some scary things going on.

337
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:56,738
Mm-hmm.

338
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,829
Do you want to move from here?

339
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:01,254
A little bit so I can
feel like a normal girl

340
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:03,254
and always don't be scared of the dark.

341
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:04,889
Okay.

342
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,028
Okay.

343
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,463
So we've got problems

344
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,399
with the under-the-bed
issue here with her.

345
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

346
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:20,705
She slides down, goes
right under the bed,

347
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:21,673
won't let them sleep.

348
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,175
Like, I see her hands coming up.

349
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:31,850
So, I don't know if she's
grabbing feet and arms,

350
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,219
and she's messing with the head.

351
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:36,788
Like, it's [bleep] terrifying.

352
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,557
And they know that she's under the bed.

353
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,361
I'm getting mad.

354
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,830
Bad, bad, bad.

355
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:01,017
Caren says she bought
the house from a disabled woman.

356
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:03,718
Turns out the lady's
name was Mary Sullivan.

357
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,052
Now, I made a few calls

358
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,354
and managed to track down her cousin,

359
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,455
who agreed to meet with me.

360
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,357
He told me that her time there

361
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,159
was filled with nothing
but heartbreak and pain.

362
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,666
My clients bought that house

363
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:19,767
from your cousin Mary Sullivan.

364
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,168
Right.

365
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,710
You spent time at the
house when Mary was there?

366
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:23,095
Yes.

367
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,139
Did you ever experience
anything that you can't explain?

368
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:26,340
No.

369
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,809
Okay. Did Mary ever
mention anything to you?

370
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:32,647
No. I don't recall anybody
saying they had any issues.

371
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:33,981
- Anything they can't explain?
- Right.

372
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,982
Okay.

373
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,384
So, John, do you have any idea

374
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,119
when your family actually
purchased the property?

375
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,186
I do.

376
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,656
My grandfather bought
the property in 1919,

377
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:45,660
and this is what it
looked like about 1934.

378
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,421
Wow. It's so different.

379
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:49,288
Mary... let's talk about her.

380
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,822
What kind of personality was she?

381
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,759
Oh, she was very outgoing,
very pleasant, very happy.

382
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,495
Here's her graduation
picture from high school.

383
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,729
She's a pretty girl.

384
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:58,931
Yeah, she is a very pretty girl.

385
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,198
On the phone,

386
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,934
you mentioned that she
had a rough go of things.

387
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,635
Yes, yes.

388
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,012
When she was 20,

389
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:07,676
she got engaged to a
midshipman at the naval academy.

390
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:11,277
And here's the midshipman
that she was engaged to.

391
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:15,281
And everything was going
well until the following year,

392
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:16,950
after she turned 21.

393
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,552
Then, she was diagnosed with polio,

394
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:22,422
and she wore a brace from
her hip down to her ankle.

395
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,491
He broke the engagement.

396
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:26,558
- She ever meet anybody else?
- No.

397
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:27,724
She never went out of her way

398
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,693
to look for another
romantic relationship.

399
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:32,295
So, did she live alone in
that house all those years?

400
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:34,331
Yes, but she kept herself busy,

401
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:37,834
in the church and the
Democratic Woman's Society.

402
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,836
So, John, I know she
sold the house in 2007.

403
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,438
How soon after that did she pass?

404
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,774
About two years later, after
her 75th birthday party.

405
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,145
Here are a couple of
pictures from that party.

406
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,680
She passed away a
couple months after that.

407
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,115
It was a total surprise.

408
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:53,884
What was the official
cause of death with Mary?

409
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,886
- It was a heart attack.
- Okay.

410
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:57,454
That's a shame.

411
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,591
One major disease just
changed her life completely.

412
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:01,550
Absolutely.

413
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,131
So, there's this old woman.

414
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,466
Has this person passed?

415
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,868
She's dead, yes.

416
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,337
The old lady looks very alive,

417
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:18,341
so I'm gonna say, you
know, she's pretty recent.

418
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:22,479
Oh damn she's in some
kind of pain, I tell you what.

419
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:27,184
Can you describe her?

420
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,252
Kind of grandma heavy, I guess.

421
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,888
Her hair was kind of gray-white.

422
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,859
She is, like, aware of,
like, this bad stuff.

423
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,127
And, then,

424
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:39,930
there's this whole thing about
religion creeping back in.

425
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:41,998
She was, like, praying
and talking about demons,

426
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,268
and I think she's talking
about the dead younger woman.

427
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,005
I think she saw her when she was alive,

428
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:51,808
'cause she really
thinks that she's evil.

429
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,312
So, here's what I know so far.

430
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:58,615
I've got a family of four being
terrorized by bizarre activity

431
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,351
on a property whose former
owner suffered from polio

432
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,253
and died of a heart attack.

433
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:04,654
But I need to see if
there's anything else

434
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:07,390
that could help my investigation.

435
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:08,658
Searching through old records,

436
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,827
I find an article about
another former owner

437
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,963
named Maurice Dougherty.

438
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:17,200
Turns out he died in a fire that
started inside Caren's house.

439
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,104
I'm heading over to
meet with a genealogist

440
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:24,307
who says Maurice Dougherty's
life was as tragic as his death.

441
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:31,548
This guy Maurice Dougherty...

442
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:32,816
What did you find out about him?

443
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:37,184
Well, he purchased that house
as a vacation home in 1930.

444
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:40,485
- He himself was very wealthy.
- Okay.

445
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,987
He was a contractor and owned
his own plumbing company.

446
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,289
What happened with the fire?

447
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:48,526
The night of the fire
was October 16, 1932.

448
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:49,585
Okay.

449
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:52,697
It was cool enough to need some heat,

450
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,668
so before he retired, he
turned on an oil stove.

451
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,869
Okay.

452
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,220
But he put it in his
bedroom, close to his bed.

453
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,721
While he was sleeping,

454
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:05,710
his sheets caught on fire
'cause they were too close.

455
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,543
When the firefighters arrived,

456
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,078
they knocked in the front door,

457
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,682
and they found him dead with
the key still in his hand.

458
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,050
So this poor [bleep]
was trying to get out

459
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:16,152
with the key and never made it.

460
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:17,153
Never made it.

461
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,387
According to his death certificate,

462
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:23,533
they have the cause of death
suffocation by inhalation.

463
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:28,869
And so the sister became
the executor of his estate.

464
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:34,274
However, the estate was sued
by a woman that came forward

465
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,744
and presented herself as his wife.

466
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,545
But there's no proof

467
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,782
or documentation or marriage license,

468
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,150
so the sister kept the property.

469
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,382
Do we know if the cops ever looked at

470
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:46,850
this woman claiming to be his wife

471
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,452
for maybe setting the whole thing up

472
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:49,653
to look like an accident?

473
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:50,788
That is a good question.

474
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,956
I don't know if she was interviewed

475
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,759
or ever a suspect in this.

476
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,295
But his background as a contractor,

477
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:01,598
would he have been that reckless

478
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,202
to put a stove so close to your bed?

479
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,906
The guy who tries to protect the living

480
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:13,944
is taking it upon himself
to protect the children.

481
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,781
So, do you get anything
on this guy in life?

482
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:22,820
He was some kind of architect
or a builder of some sort.

483
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:26,757
I think he died in his 40s, 50s.

484
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:30,628
He feels like he was put
out to dry or something.

485
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,265
I think he got himself
into a bad situation and...

486
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,534
What do you mean?

487
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,002
He kind of feels like he was murdered,

488
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:40,638
but I don't know if he's
really showing me the truth,

489
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,078
because I feel like he
did himself in, you know,

490
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,078
and he's not taking responsibility.

491
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,014
Maybe he was wrongfully murdered.

492
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:00,189

and we'll help if we can.

497
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:19,052
You know, another thing caught
my attention in research.

498
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:22,219
There was a deadly boat accident
right near Caren's house,

499
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:24,649
14 dead.

500
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,616
I'm on my way to meet
with a maritime historian

501
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,551
who's gonna tell me
exactly what happened.

502
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,694
I wanted to talk to you
about this article I found

503
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,496
in regards to a boat wreck

504
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:42,297
that happened right by
my client's property.

505
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,632
What can you tell me
about what happened?

506
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,301
The ship originally
was used to haul cargo.

507
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,737
This is the picture of her right there.

508
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,872
Okay.

509
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:53,876
In 1954, a guy named John Mecklin bought

510
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,311
and converted the
straight-hulled schooner

511
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:57,613
into a cruising ship.

512
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,581
Here's a picture of
John Mecklin right here.

513
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:02,785
What do we know about this guy?

514
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:04,186
He really had very, very little

515
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,855
or almost no maritime
experience whatsoever,

516
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:08,490
but bought the ship.

517
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:11,026
He says, "I can make a great business

518
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:13,550
going up and down the
Chesapeake Bay with passengers."

519
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,418
So he spends a little bit
of money repairing the ship,

520
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,487
but it was a very, very bad job.

521
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,823
It was very sloppy, and as a result,

522
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:24,158
the ship really was not seaworthy.

523
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,626
And for the next few years,

524
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:28,615
it operated up and down the
bay in this new and popular way

525
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:30,234
that people enjoyed
themselves called cruising.

526
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,334
Take me through the day of the tragedy.

527
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,535
Monday the 8th of August,

528
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:36,705
they set sail with 23
passengers and a crew of 4.

529
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,039
Little do they know

530
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,875
that Hurricane Connie's
moving up this way.

531
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:43,712
Friday, the 12th of August, 1955.

532
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:44,946
The hurricane hits.

533
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,048
The winds were well
over 60 miles an hour.

534
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,718
Waves probably were a good 8 to 12 feet,

535
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,721
which is huge in a bay like this.

536
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:56,291
Once he recognizes that it's
time to get some protection,

537
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:59,828
he comes sailing
across and tries to moor

538
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,563
right up by your client's place.

539
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:04,499
He drops anchor, but the ship capsizes,

540
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:05,967
the passengers all go flying out,

541
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,203
and the ship is
literally torn to pieces.

542
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:11,039
All the passengers are
grabbing hold of wreckage

543
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:12,841
to try and save themselves.

544
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,043
Here's a picture of the
actual rescue effort.

545
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,680
- Some make it. 14 don't.
- Wow.

546
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:19,914
Bodies were starting to float ashore

547
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:21,539
up and down this entire area.

548
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,704
Okay, so, the captain...

549
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:24,139
was he ever held accountable
for what happened?

550
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:26,074
He was very fortunate
to have a good lawyer.

551
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:28,877
He was found guilty of
four counts of negligence,

552
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,747
was given suspended sentence
and on probation for a year.

553
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:32,714
That's it.

554
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:36,318
- Aw, geez.
- Yeah. Terrible tragedy.

555
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:43,792
So, I'm getting some weird stuff.

556
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:48,397
Kind of looks like a hairy man,

557
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:53,669
but it seems to kind of
be, like, running around...

558
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:59,741
kind of like an ape on the knuckles.

559
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:03,312
This might have just been
a regular guy at some point.

560
00:26:03,414 --> 00:26:05,347
I guess he's taken on this appearance

561
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,282
to kind of like be intimidating,

562
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:10,586
trying to keep living people away.

563
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:14,723
There is something about
a crash, like a boat.

564
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,627
This boat accident happened
a very long time ago

565
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:20,262
with this guy.

566
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,831
I'm just seeing like, rain
and [bleep] and he's yelling,

567
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,200
and I'm hearing all
these people yelling.

568
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:28,403
He was in charge of a boat,
and it sank or something,

569
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,139
and it killed... I think
it killed everybody.

570
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,053
During my walk, I saw
several dead people,

571
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:46,188
but the young woman
attacking the living child

572
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,858
has me the most concerned.

573
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,694
I saw this woman under the bed.

574
00:26:54,332 --> 00:26:57,199
Her face is all black. It's all black.

575
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:09,545
She's grabbing this child
and is torturing her.

576
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:20,122
Is this what you saw?

577
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,925
Yes, that's what I saw.

578
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:44,331
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

579
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,298
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

580
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
and our clients for the first time.

581
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,358
Amy, I'd like you to meet Caren,

582
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,393
and this is her mom, Jan.

583
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:55,629
Her story really touched my heart.

584
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:58,131
Now, her husband works for
the Department of Defense

585
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:01,201
and is overseas most of the time.

586
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,236
Now, Jan lives down the street,

587
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:05,005
- so Caren's here alone...
- Okay.

588
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:08,341
With a hell of a lot of activity.

589
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:09,609
And she's got three young girls

590
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:12,545
that are being affected
tremendously by it.

591
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:16,049
This is Laurel, who's 14.

592
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:18,385
This is Aspen, who's 8.

593
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:20,086
And this is Cedar, who's 6.

594
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:23,556
This is the one Caren's
most worried about.

595
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:24,724
Caren believes

596
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:28,194
this is literally a
life-and-death situation.

597
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:29,472
So now that Amy knows

598
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:31,405
a little bit about the family dynamics,

599
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:32,940
I'm gonna ask her to describe her walk.

600
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:39,345
When I first got
here, I was at the door,

601
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:44,350
and I was seeing a lot of negativity,

602
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:47,220
like, actually rolling in.

603
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:50,156
That negative energy can cause people

604
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:54,294
to feel very unsettled
and kind of unstable here.

605
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:57,063
It can cause massive fighting.

606
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:58,364
Wow.

607
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,667
The fighting...

608
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,635
My three girls fight all the time,

609
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:08,007
and I constantly am trying
to keep everyone calm.

610
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:11,978
And then I end up yelling,
and we're all yelling,

611
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,614
and it comes out of nowhere,
and especially for Cedar.

612
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,349
It's constant.

613
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:19,752
It's a challenge every day
to bring them back down.

614
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:22,855
It's heartbreaking.

615
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,961
So, what else did you see?

616
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:31,831
I met a male,

617
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:35,468
and he was in the kitchen
and dining room area.

618
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,137
He seemed to be in his 40s, 50s.

619
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,507
I got that he was in
building or construction.

620
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,675
He was yelling at me
that he had been murdered

621
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,311
and all this bad stuff
had happened to him,

622
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,913
and, like, just something about him,

623
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:51,201
I was like, "I don't
know if that's true."

624
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,369
But, later, I saw him elsewhere,

625
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:56,938
and he seems to be going out of his way

626
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,604
to try to protect people here.

627
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,510
Well, there's really
not a lot to go on here,

628
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,912
but there is somebody who lived here

629
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:06,948
that was in construction, and
he died a mysterious death.

630
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,616
His name was Maurice Dougherty.

631
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,185
He was a wealthy contractor,

632
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:13,988
and he bought this property
back in 1930 as a summer home.

633
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:16,291
So, now, back on October 16, 1932,

634
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:17,592
he was sleeping here,

635
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,627
and it was a cold night
for that time of the year,

636
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:22,864
so he set up a stove and
put it next to his bed

637
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,232
to keep himself warm.

638
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,901
Now, at some point in the
night, the sheets caught on fire.

639
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:28,837
He was overcome by smoke,

640
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:31,072
and by the time the firemen got here,

641
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:32,774
he was DOA.

642
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:36,845
Now, they found him on
the floor, locked inside,

643
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:39,247
with the key to the door in his hand.

644
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:42,502
I actually have an
article about his death.

645
00:30:42,602 --> 00:30:44,635
Wow.

646
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:47,104
Now, he was 49 years old.

647
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,673
He apparently lived here alone.

648
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,608
I got the death certificate.

649
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,444
His sister winded up
getting the property.

650
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,212
But here's where the
story gets a little weird.

651
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,315
After Maurice died,

652
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,685
this mystery woman came forward
and claimed to be his widow.

653
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:04,188
She wanted a piece of the house,
I guess whatever money he had,

654
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,657
but she couldn't provide
any documentation or proof

655
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,925
that she was married to this guy,

656
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:10,227
and the sister didn't
know who the hell she was.

657
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,197
So when you say he
feels like he was murdered,

658
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,032
I'm not so sure the death went down

659
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:17,535
the way the cops and the
firemen saw it that night.

660
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:19,804
First of all, the guy's
a seasoned contractor.

661
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,105
Are you gonna be stupid enough

662
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,907
to put an oil heater
right next to your bed?

663
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,742
- Right.
- I'm speculating.

664
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,078
Maybe she was staying here
with him, locks the door on him.

665
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,613
Now she wanted to go after his money.

666
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:29,814
Wow.

667
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,182
Did you guys know about any of this?

668
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:34,418
- No. No idea.
- Okay.

669
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:41,125
Now, you said this guy's
protecting the family.

670
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:42,660
What's he protecting them from?

671
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:45,596
The main issue here is
that there's a dead woman.

672
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:49,600
She had very long hair. She was wet.

673
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:52,570
I saw her coming out
from that television.

674
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,974
People would see her moving...

675
00:31:57,076 --> 00:32:00,144
like a shadowy figure.

676
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,715
She's always watching.

677
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:05,983
Oh.

678
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:08,419
But what concerned me

679
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:13,157
was what she was doing
upstairs in the yellow room.

680
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,125
Cedar's room.

681
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:15,426
She was there.

682
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:19,430
She was extremely agitated
because the protector,

683
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,532
the dead man, is there.

684
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:24,135
What he told me was that he's
trying to teach the children

685
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:27,104
how to stay away from
the creepy, dead woman.

686
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,273
He said he's not trying to scare them.

687
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,776
He's trying to make them listen.

688
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:34,945
So the dead lady tries
to be more aggressive,

689
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:36,847
but she can't break through the barrier.

690
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:38,215
Wow.

691
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:41,018
Cedar is the biggest
reason Caren called us in.

692
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,221
And you hit on a lot of the
things she's experiencing,

693
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,424
and there's a lot.

694
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:47,992
Your daughter mentioned
the guy with the brown arms

695
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:49,393
coming out of the ceiling.

696
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:51,028
Cedar says that he yells at her.

697
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,330
He tries to push her out of bed.

698
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:54,598
He's very threatening.

699
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,367
It scares her.

700
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,402
Interesting, interesting.

701
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,004
Even though it seems harsh,

702
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,573
I think that's just his way
of trying to protect her.

703
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,908
Okay.

704
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,043
Jan was watching Cedar,

705
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:07,945
and she was screaming in her crib.

706
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:09,213
Tell her what you heard.

707
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:10,381
She was screaming,

708
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,283
"Get out, get out. Leave me alone."

709
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:15,086
And as we were walking out of the door,

710
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:17,088
I heard a low voice,

711
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,756
"Everything's gonna be all right."

712
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,491
Interesting. Okay.

713
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:24,261
I got sketches that she's drawn.

714
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:27,331
This is the man with the brown arms.

715
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:30,835
That's a bloody man.

716
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,536
Okay.

717
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:33,904
She also has drawn one

718
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,906
that had a gunshot through the head.

719
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:38,142
Really?

720
00:33:38,244 --> 00:33:40,077
The drawings she makes are horrible.

721
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,046
How many spirits?

722
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,247
Has she seen?

723
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:45,216
Over a hundred.

724
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:47,651
A hundred.

725
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,086
It's every night.

726
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,422
Geez.

727
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:55,326
Your daughter... I think
she's a physical medium.

728
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:00,164
And that's what
Amy is, by the way.

729
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,801
Oh, my God.

730
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:07,104
Oh, my gosh.

731
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:09,440
There is other elements to the ability.

732
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,275
We're able to affect our environment.

733
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:11,524
Typically,

734
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:15,532
it's when we're highly
emotional, angry, sad.

735
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:18,032
And if people live with us,

736
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:21,221
they will have
experiences at some point.

737
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,969
She has daily rages.

738
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:27,806
She became very, I would
say, at times violent.

739
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:28,907
Yes.

740
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:32,744
Totally different little girl.

741
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,414
When dead people come to her,

742
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:37,616
she is experiencing their lives.

743
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,184
This is some heavy stuff

744
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,954
for a child to be
absorbing and witnessing,

745
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:43,822
and that's why you're seeing

746
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:47,519
the behavioral reactions constantly.

747
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,314
This is all just shocking and confusing.

748
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:58,945
I knew her behavior was
unusual for a 6-year-old,

749
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,447
but this is really heavy.

750
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,784
No wonder she's anxious and depressed.

751
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,353
She doesn't know what to
expect around every corner.

752
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:15,187
I went into the pink room.

753
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,355
That's Aspen's room.

754
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,757
The protector said

755
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:21,226
that he wasn't able
to get through to her.

756
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,761
Therefore, the dead woman

757
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:26,731
was a little bit more
active in that room...

758
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,267
the dead woman who's
laying under the bed,

759
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,270
trying to grab her feet and her arms

760
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:34,339
and messing with her hair.

761
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:36,842
And the protector was
standing in the room,

762
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:39,511
telling me how angry
he was about everything,

763
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:41,513
saying it was uncalled
for and disgusting,

764
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:45,784
and he was asking God to
put a stop to this behavior.

765
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,655
Many nights, Aspen sees
a little girl in her room.

766
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,951
She has long, curly, brown hair.

767
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,853
And the hair is wet, isn't it?

768
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,821
It's wet, yes.

769
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,490
And one time,

770
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:06,329
she felt a thumb press
into the back of her neck.

771
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,231
And there's someone who watches her

772
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,199
from the corner of her room.

773
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,534
She said there's a shadow?

774
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,837
A shadow, yes, every night.

775
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,241
Well, I did a sketch of what I saw.

776
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,009
Oh, my gosh.

777
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,113
I have to show you this.

778
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,388
Oh, my gosh.

779
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,323
This is my granddaughter
going through this.

780
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,859
It's heart-wrenching.

781
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,295
That's exactly what she describes.

782
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:44,268
She says it's like fingers
going down her legs.

783
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,704
What the hell does
this woman want with the kids?

784
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,175
When I went into the
master bedroom.

785
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,077
I figured out a lot of stuff.

786
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:58,949
I felt a living woman
feeling very isolated,

787
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,419
lost in depression.

788
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,554
You are feeling this.

789
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:06,790
Yes. Those were the exact words I used.

790
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,060
What I got was that the dead woman

791
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:15,532
is making everyone feel this
way to tear the family apart.

792
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,234
That's what she wants.

793
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,036
The reason why she's doing this

794
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:21,538
is because she wants
you to be her mother.

795
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,940
What?!

796
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,577
She's jealous
of the other children.

797
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,912
That's why she torments them.

798
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:33,383
While all of this was happening
and I'm figuring this out,

799
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,919
like, she just, like,
split-second, like,

800
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,989
karate-chopped me in the neck.

801
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:43,260
She is very capable
of doing physical harm.

802
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:49,166
Well, I've been attacked in my room.

803
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,300
Really?

804
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,937
I was sleeping, and all of a sudden,

805
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,106
a big chunk of
hair... whoo!...

806
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,376
pulled me up off my pillow.

807
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:03,480
Scared the living daylights out of me.

808
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,149
Now, is this little
[bleep] doing that to her?

809
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,252
Yeah. She's the main problem here.

810
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:11,221
She wants to be with you.

811
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:15,125
The only way she can be with you
is if you were to kill yourself.

812
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:18,662
Then you guys would
spend eternity together,

813
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,864
and you would forever
be her mother, alone.

814
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,900
Oh, my God.

815
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:26,236
Wow!

816
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,405
Yeah.

817
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,040
I thought what I was experiencing

818
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:33,270
was just fallout from Cedar.

819
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:37,427
I just can't believe this is happening.

820
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,368
So, Caren, when we spoke,
you looked me right in the eye

821
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,767
and said you'll do whatever it takes

822
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,435
to protect your kids.

823
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,870
It sounds like after tonight,

824
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,605
you need some help yourself.

825
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:05,040
Yes.

826
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,275
Now, we're gonna find
out what it's gonna take

827
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,810
to make that happen.

828
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:09,978
So for that,

829
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,647
I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy for some answers.

830
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,550
So, the first thing
I would like to see happen

831
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:19,521
is contacting a Native
American, a medicine person,

832
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,791
to do a cleansing and remove the dead

833
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,994
that are here in the house.

834
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:30,699
Then, I would like for you to
have a Reiki master come in,

835
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,168
and what they're going to be doing

836
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,303
is removing any attachments.

837
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,738
Basically,

838
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,910
they're gonna be removing all
of that built-up negative energy

839
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,612
and releasing that,

840
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,248
cutting any cords that have formed.

841
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,086
Now, for your daughter Cedar,

842
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:56,358
the first thing is for her to
learn meditation techniques.

843
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,060
This is very, very important here.

844
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,063
Really, when she starts
doing the meditation,

845
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,799
her light basically will dim,

846
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,169
and the dead won't be as
drawn to her as they have been.

847
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,037
Okay.

848
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,948
The second thing is for
her to have a power object.

849
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:14,681
Now, this is an object

850
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:19,619
that she's going to feel
protects her and empowers her

851
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:22,155
that she can carry with
her anywhere and everywhere

852
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,867
and she can sleep with it, et cetera.

853
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,733
The third thing is...

854
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:29,769
we're gonna call it the
room lock-down, okay?

855
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:33,073
So every night, she's
gonna have her power object,

856
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,542
and she's gonna have her mantra, okay?

857
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:39,112
So what she's gonna say is
something along the lines of

858
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,615
"Leave me be. I'm too young to help.

859
00:40:41,717 --> 00:40:44,951
Go to another. You cannot be here.

860
00:40:45,053 --> 00:40:47,587
You cannot speak to
me. You cannot jump me.

861
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,856
You must stay outside."

862
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,025
And that will keep them from coming?

863
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:52,792
Yes.

864
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:54,060
This is the basis

865
00:40:54,162 --> 00:41:00,066
of her starting her
process of self-empowerment,

866
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,768
drawing her boundaries,

867
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,071
and making sure that
her space is her own.

868
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,007
We have a path,

869
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:09,502
and this family will follow the path.

870
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,040
At least you're smiling now.

871
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,379
It's good to have some
answers to know what to do.

872
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:17,580
I feel like,

873
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:20,616
"Okay, we have a path ahead,
and if we do these things,

874
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,452
we're all gonna feel better."

875
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:25,021
That's what I want.

876
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,623
I want my little girl to
feel like a little girl.

877
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,193
I really feel for Caren.

878
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:33,229
Learning that your child
can interact with the dead

879
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:34,563
can be terrifying.

880
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,966
But I believe if they follow my advice,

881
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:39,368
Cedar will learn to
harness her abilities.

882
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,671
And with the help of a Reiki
master and a medicine person,

883
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:46,229
they can banish the dead
and live a peaceful life.
