1
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:13,527
This is weird. There's a problem here.

2
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,512
She turned her head, and it
was like this demonic face.

3
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:19,716
Big impact in
his stomach. Ooh, ooh!

4
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,584
Do they execute this rat [bleep]?

5
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:22,785
They do.

6
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,187
He ruins people.

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,722
He caused a lot of people to die.

8
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:29,192
I feel like there's a
presence inside this house.

9
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:32,795
They're, like, trying to fight for life.

10
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:35,498
Trying to run from death.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,934
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:40,003
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,272
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:43,506
They're from hell.

15
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:44,507
I see dead people.

16
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,942
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:47,577
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,613
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

19
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,015
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,383
Her neck got broken.

21
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,386
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,288
I hear a gunshot.

23
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,556
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,823
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:04,694
Something's not right here.

27
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:08,231
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,767
It's not safe here. It's
my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,235
Are any of them buried on the property?

30
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,636
They're all buried here.

31
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:15,505
But Steve and I never speak.

32
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:17,674
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,008
Until the very end.

34
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,276
I can't do it no more.

35
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:22,579
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,947
Holy [bleep] Look at this!

37
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,448
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,116
It does not have a happy ending.

39
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,982
Something kills people here.

40
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:45,086
I'm in Richmond Heights, Ohio,

41
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,419
it's a small town about
15 miles east of Cleveland.

42
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,888
I got a call from a woman named Annette.

43
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,657
She's a feisty lady,
not scared of anything...

44
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,459
except what's in her house.

45
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,661
She says what's going
on has gotten so bad,

46
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,531
it's ripping her large family apart.

47
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,698
She sounded pretty upset,

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,563
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

49
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:06,371
Before Amy arrives,

50
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,707
I clear the house of
any leading information.

51
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,576
Family photos and religious items

52
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,845
must be covered or removed.

53
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,146
When I'm finished,

54
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,315
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

55
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,107
Oh, boy.

56
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,476
There's a female.

57
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:32,012
She is not mentally sound.

58
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:37,217
And she's basically
screaming for her life.

59
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,287
So she's always in the process of dying.

60
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:44,491
And it's due to a
gunshot or a stab wound.

61
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,977
I'm also seeing this dead teenage girl.

62
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,799
Her hair is very long,

63
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,801
and like, really dirty.

64
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:59,004
And she is decomposing.

65
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:04,576
What I see is a man in the shadows.

66
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,645
She points to him, and she said,

67
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:09,047
"You murdered me."

68
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,551
And then I get a really super sharp pain

69
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,153
right here in my neck.

70
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:18,290
And I'm thinking, like,
he might have stabbed her.

71
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,036
So, Annette,
you sounded really upset

72
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:29,038
when we spoke on the phone.

73
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,507
What the hell's going on?

74
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,561
My family means everything to me,

75
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,399
and this house is
tearing our family apart.

76
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:39,135
I mean, I've always been a strong woman,

77
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,295
and I always told everyone,

78
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:44,564
"Do not mess with my husband,
my family, or my home."

79
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,466
This is just something I can't handle.

80
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:48,301
What exactly are people experiencing?

81
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:54,140
From unexplained noises, sounds
of footsteps all over the house.

82
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,775
Seeing apparitions,

83
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,479
and, here, lately,
being physically touched.

84
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:03,316
Okay. So who exactly lives here?

85
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,685
Currently, just my husband and I.

86
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,787
- I know you have a big family.
- I do.

87
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,358
I have seven children
and 11 grandchildren.

88
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,227
This is my family.

89
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,863
WE have five daughters and two sons.

90
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,231
How long have you guys lived here?

91
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,866
For about 15 years now.

92
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,435
What prompted you to
call us now, though?

93
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,638
My son, who came home from the Army,

94
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,339
he stayed with us for a while,

95
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,476
but that activity increased so much,

96
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,745
and he decided to leave.

97
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:35,124
My grandchildren do not
want to spend the night here.

98
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:37,324
If they come over,
it's during the daytime,

99
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:40,294
and they're out of
here before nightfall.

100
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,741
Annette, I'm curious about your husband.

101
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,923
How's he feel about this whole thing?

102
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,191
I called you guys,

103
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:49,528
and, you know, it
started some arguments.

104
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,631
This is his family, he should
be able to fix it, so...

105
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,600
Is he okay with us being here?

106
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,903
He knows I feel strongly about this.

107
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:01,073
I need my life back,
I need my family back.

108
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,608
I want my home back.

109
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,216
My goodness.

110
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,118
Okay.

111
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,054
I'm getting a lot of people
talking to me at once.

112
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:21,994
Somebody who lives here,
I think it's a male.

113
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,799
There's somebody in this house

114
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,403
who does not want us to be doing this,

115
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,304
thinks it's bad,

116
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:31,706
it's gonna stir [bleep] up.

117
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,241
So this is a living person.

118
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:34,409
Yeah. That's here.

119
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,410
- Yes.
- Okay.

120
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:37,278
He's a control freak,

121
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,580
and he thinks he's got
it all under control

122
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,150
and he's, like, the man of the house,

123
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:43,684
and you know,

124
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,853
he can protect his own kind of thing.

125
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,855
Like, you know, I don't
need your guys' help.

126
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,590
You don't need to be here.

127
00:05:56,654 --> 00:06:00,222
This is where some of the
worst experiences have happened.

128
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,024
Okay, like what?

129
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:05,344
At night, there's a male figure

130
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:07,911
that I see standing in that hallway.

131
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,347
And he stands there as though,

132
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,183
he's, like, keeping guard or
watching over and looking in

133
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,317
and checking in.

134
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,719
Okay, is it something
you can see through

135
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,587
- or is it solid?
- It's solid.

136
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,657
It's like a dark man with all black on.

137
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,125
You ever think about
shutting the door at night?

138
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,693
No.

139
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:26,096
You might want to start doing that.

140
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,098
I don't want to be
locked in here with it.

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,500
Mmm.

142
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:31,535
All right, anything else?

143
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,603
I hear this voice call my name.

144
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,006
Several times, I've, like, responded,

145
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,274
thinking it was someone here,

146
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,810
and then realizing, "Wait a
minute, I'm here by myself."

147
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,445
Is it a male voice or a female voice?

148
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,046
Female voice.

149
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,514
Could the TV have been on?

150
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,882
No.

151
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,851
Okay. Anything else?

152
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:51,354
Yeah, another time, I
was laying in bed here,

153
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:55,559
and this demonic female form was
sitting at the foot of my bed.

154
00:06:55,661 --> 00:07:00,230
I woke up and I saw it, 'cause
I felt it actually sit down.

155
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:03,767
She turned her head, and it
was like this demonic face.

156
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:08,171
Like, a beige tone, brown tone gargoyle.

157
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,840
Okay.

158
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,508
Like something out of a scary movie.

159
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,047
It was just something
that was terrifying.

160
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,651
The dead teenage
girl comes in here a lot.

161
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:25,155
She likes it in here a lot.

162
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:30,193
And there's a connection between
her and the person in this room.

163
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:33,196
There is communication
there, 'cause I see, like,

164
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:36,800
the dead girl, like sitting
here in the middle of the floor.

165
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:39,703
And she's talking to somebody.

166
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,204
There's a relationship.

167
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,007
This is her safe space, her safe area.

168
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,942
She really likes this person.

169
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:49,145
But because she's dying all the time,

170
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:54,951
this person might feel really
weird aches and pains...

171
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,087
through their body, their joints.

172
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:59,789
Obviously, it's not healthy.

173
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,492
So it's almost like
she's becoming a zombie.

174
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,101
So, William, I spoke to Annette.

175
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,703
And she's still pretty upset
about the stuff going on.

176
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,839
Are you happy we're here?

177
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:16,706
No.

178
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:17,307
Why?

179
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,041
'Cause I didn't know

180
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,676
nothing about you all.

181
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,279
It could have made
something worse or, you know.

182
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:23,446
Do you believe in any of this stuff?

183
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:24,781
- Well, I do now.
- You do?

184
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:26,983
Yes. So I gotta assume by that answer,

185
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,985
- you've had experiences.
- Yes.

186
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:30,086
Okay, can you tell
me about some of them?

187
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,969
Okay, yeah, I was in
the basement watching TV.

188
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,802
And out of the corner of my eyes,

189
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,171
I seen a lady up on the wall,

190
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:38,873
coming down the steps.

191
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,174
What did she look like?

192
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:43,678
She was a little short white
lady with long, white hair

193
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,446
and a long, white gown.

194
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:46,781
And she was walking up

195
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:48,616
against the wall like this
and coming down the steps.

196
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:49,917
And just looking at me like,

197
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,987
"Do he see me?" It
ain't like I'm asleep.

198
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,325
I'm sitting there looking at
her, and saying, "Oh, my God!"

199
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:58,960
Man, that's a little strange.

200
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,127
Anything else?

201
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,129
One night, we were
sitting in the basement,

202
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,399
and seemed like somebody
done broke in or something

203
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,001
because this...

204
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,370
it was so loud on that floor.

205
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,905
We looked around.

206
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,139
Nothing.

207
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,641
- You guys have dogs?
- No.

208
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:16,177
Okay, you ever check for rodents?

209
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,512
- Uh, no.
- Okay.

210
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,848
Um, so anything else?

211
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,918
Yeah, I was coming down the
steps about 8:00 in the morning.

212
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,487
And seen a body of flashing lights,

213
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,557
like a thousand flashing
lights, all in one body,

214
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,525
trickling, coming at me.

215
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:32,927
Okay, so let me get
this description right.

216
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,563
This is the first time I'm
hearing something like this.

217
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:36,697
Okay. Big round...

218
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,332
Round, like that, yeah.

219
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,301
About as long as your body.

220
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:41,502
- Really?
- Yes.

221
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:43,471
Almost knocked me down
it scared me so bad.

222
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,412
Oh, boy.

223
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:55,683
I see, like, this guy, who,
I'm assuming, is not good.

224
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:02,390
I don't know how he's
manifesting this weird light.

225
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:04,658
And I think that the living

226
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:09,630
would probably see this weird light.

227
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:11,665
It wouldn't be like the whole room

228
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,234
would be filled with this light,

229
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:16,137
it would be like kind of a cut-out.

230
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,648
So, the guy from outside,
this guy in the light,

231
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,718
he's in here.

232
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,554
He ruins people.

233
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:33,855
How.

234
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:37,767
He does, like, an analysis
of the people in the house,

235
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,669
and then he just takes

236
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,137
whatever's most valuable to them.

237
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,418
So if a man's wife

238
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,486
is the most valuable
thing, he'll destroy that.

239
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,725
He wants out of here, and
he can't get out of here.

240
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,127
I guess he thinks this is his hell.

241
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,142
Mom said that you had
recently moved back,

242
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,278
but then you moved
out. What was the story?

243
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,014
I had a tour over in Afghanistan,

244
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,950
and when I had got back, I
was here about five months.

245
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:30,119
Now, did you leave because of
what's going on in the house?

246
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,320
- Yes.
- Explain to me how

247
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,555
a guy like you, who's
been in combat conditions,

248
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:34,957
could be driven out of a house.

249
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,459
Well, one time I was laying in bed,

250
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,664
and I heard a conversation
going on between two females.

251
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,165
Were you able to make
out what they were saying?

252
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,900
I was not able to make
out what they were saying.

253
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,969
It sounded like a real
muffled conversation.

254
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,672
I thought that maybe my mom
had stayed home from work.

255
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:50,839
Okay, was Mom home?

256
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:51,874
No, no one was home.

257
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:53,542
Okay, what about the TV being on?

258
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,177
Then that was my second thought.

259
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,380
Until I opened my door
to use the restroom

260
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:01,717
and the conversation between
the two females stopped.

261
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,352
Okay, anything else?

262
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:06,622
There feels like there's a
presence inside this house

263
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,090
at certain times.

264
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,192
I'd say when I'm walking up the stairs,

265
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:11,894
I feel like something's behind me.

266
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,897
Feels like something is
immediately coming after me.

267
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,131
There's been many instances

268
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,201
where I've slept outside in the car.

269
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,670
Yeah, I don't want to
be inside this house.

270
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,172
All right, so let me ask you a question,

271
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,640
- would you sleep here alone?
- No, never.

272
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:27,509
I wouldn't stay a
night here again...

273
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,711
with our without people here.

274
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,185
So it's not happening.

275
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:36,758
The two murdered women are in here,

276
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,791
and they're literally,

277
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:43,062
like, pacing around
at the end of this bed.

278
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,097
The living can see them,

279
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,235
and the one who's crazy

280
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:52,338
is making these people crazy.

281
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,000
That would be like, you know,

282
00:12:55,102 --> 00:13:00,973
loss of focus, hearing
voices, hallucinations.

283
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:05,578
Extreme depression
Extreme depression.

284
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,120
So, Nikki, I was talking to Mom.

285
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:16,989
It's heartbreaking listening
to her talk about how family

286
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,325
is just torn apart by
what's going on here.

287
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:20,659
Nobody wants to come here.

288
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,528
Nobody wants to come here.

289
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,697
We travel from Georgia to come up here,

290
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,566
- and usually we just get a hotel.
- Really?

291
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:31,403
We'd rather pay money to go to a hotel

292
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,205
then to stay in this house.

293
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:34,740
Okay, so it sounds like you've had

294
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,208
some pretty bad experiences here.

295
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,476
Yeah.

296
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,078
I just get the feeling of panic

297
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,679
when I walk into this house.

298
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:43,315
It's this feeling of being overwhelmed

299
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:47,519
when you know that
something might just happen.

300
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:49,488
- I'm nervous now.
- I can see it.

301
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,090
It feels like I need to leave,

302
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,625
like something was just,

303
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,994
like, "Get out of this house."

304
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,529
But have you actually
experienced anything?

305
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,413
I was would sleep in the den,

306
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,747
and I woke up from out of my sleep,

307
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,283
and I saw something come downstairs.

308
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,584
It was this tall man.

309
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,922
When I saw him, we looked at each other,

310
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:10,923
and then he backed up, then
went back up the stairs.

311
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,658
Could you describe what he looked like?

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,060
Tall guy. He might have been white.

313
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,795
Maybe his fifties.

314
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,230
You don't have to, you know,

315
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,732
keep scaring me in
order for me to get it.

316
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,492
I get it, I saw you,
you saw me, it's... no.

317
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:24,491
Game over.

318
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,426
That's it.

319
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:27,761
I want everybody to be safe.

320
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,630
I want this thing out of here.

321
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,535
Hmm.

322
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,503
Hmm.

323
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,839
It's a male.

324
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:40,274
This is like a panic.

325
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,653
I'm so panicked.

326
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,819
Panicked, panicked.

327
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,541
Trying to fight for life.

328
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:50,775
Trying to fight death.

329
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,678
Trying to run from death.

330
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,681
It's awful. My brain is being affected.

331
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,817
I can't talk right.

332
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:04,389
Feel sick, horrible, nauseous.

333
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:08,693
I think the living would feel this.

334
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:12,197
They would feel massive
amounts of panic down here.

335
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,200
And then feeling like impending doom.

336
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,942
Oh, yeah, it feels worse in here.

337
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:25,710
Oof! Ooh!

338
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:29,314
I don't understand
anybody coming down here.

339
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,319
There's like a crushing, crushing pain.

340
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,489
Oh, God!

341
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:51,474
Annette and William didn't
know much history about their home,

342
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,276
so I made some calls,
and I found out a woman

343
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:56,197
suffering from Alzheimer's
used to live in their house.

344
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:58,698
In fact, I managed to track
down the woman's pastor,

345
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,533
who says he knew her
and has some information

346
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,668
that will definitely help my case.

347
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,843
Pastor Hill, thanks for
meeting me, I appreciate that.

348
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:13,546
The house I'm investigating, you
had mentioned the previous owner

349
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,848
was actually a member
of your church here.

350
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,850
Yes. So, Pastor, do you have any idea

351
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,986
when she moved into the
house I'm investigating?

352
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:22,121
Yes, Eleanor moved in in 1973

353
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:26,159
when she met and married
Valentine Carpozi.

354
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,961
Tragically, five years
into their marriage,

355
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,831
he has a massive heart attack
on the living room floor,

356
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:36,169
and then one hour later,
at the hospital, he dies.

357
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,704
I can almost guarantee you he
was already dead in the house

358
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,642
and they just moved him to the
hospital for the family's sake.

359
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:48,047
Young guy,
too... only 66.

360
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,551
That dead guy who
was trying to fight death

361
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:54,020
died down here.

362
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,055
And this was recent.

363
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:58,090
This person died recently.

364
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,225
So I think he's older.

365
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:03,029
I think he's maybe in his sixties.

366
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,998
I think he was 68.

367
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,707
I want to say that this
guy, like, owned this house.

368
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:11,407
He knew he was gonna die,
and he was trying to fight it,

369
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,143
and he was, like, running
from place to place to try to,

370
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:18,047
I guess, outrun death or something.

371
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,315
Do you know how he died?

372
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,983
Maybe a stroke.

373
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,754
Can't move his jaw,
can't speak really well.

374
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,657
His brain feels weird,
and he feels nauseous.

375
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,792
This is not good. This is really bad.

376
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:35,431
Like, he's making people
very, very, very, very sick.

377
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:39,558
Eleanor, did she ever re-marry?

378
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,659
No.

379
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,194
Okay, so how long did she
stay in the house alone?

380
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,929
21 years by herself.

381
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:44,996
What kind of woman was she?

382
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,598
She was here every Sunday.

383
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,501
Her faith was what got her through.

384
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:50,736
What kind of a church is this?

385
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,004
It's kind of not like any other.

386
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,108
We do communicate with the dead.

387
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,145
You help patrons of the church
communicate with the dead?

388
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,647
- Yes.
- Wow.

389
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,849
Pastor, let me ask you a question.

390
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,584
The people that come
here, the congregation,

391
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:09,254
do you think they all
have psychic abilities?

392
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,157
We all are born with the abilities,

393
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,760
and the people come
here to develop them.

394
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,061
Okay, now, what about Eleanor?

395
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,729
Do we know if she had any abilities?

396
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:18,830
Yes.

397
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,265
Eleanor would always
sit in the front here.

398
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,600
She was a believer.

399
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,002
Okay, so now you said she
lived there for 21 years.

400
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,537
Did she die in the
house I'm investigating?

401
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,641
No. In the '90s, she was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

402
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:32,077
In fear of her safety, in 1999,

403
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,147
they put her into an
assisted living facility.

404
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,782
When does she eventually pass away?

405
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,684
- December 29, 2001.
- Okay.

406
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,621
And I actually have
her death certificate.

407
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,189
Okay, do we know what she died of?

408
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,757
- Cardiac arrest.
- She did.

409
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,192
In the nursing home.

410
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,996
Okay.

411
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:55,233
What?

412
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,568
The [bleep]?

413
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,006
I see leashes from a woman

414
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,608
to the two dead women.

415
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,111
Interesting.

416
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,412
I'm mad.

417
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:11,116
Somebody here messed
with either a Ouija board

418
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,486
or some seance...
some kind of [bleep].

419
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,855
Might be practicing witchcraft.

420
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:20,425
And they have now basically enslaved

421
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,462
these two dead people...
these two dead females.

422
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,767
William told me he hears
footsteps in the house

423
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,233
all the time.

424
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:31,237
Now, sometimes people

425
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,005
start blaming everything
on the paranormal.

426
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,740
It could just be rodents.

427
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,275
I'm heading back to the
house now to meet with

428
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,877
a pest control expert to see
if that could be the case.

429
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,958
Well, Jessie, thanks for
meeting me, I appreciate that.

430
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,993
Everybody in the house
is hearing footsteps.

431
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,762
Have you ever encountered a place

432
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,997
where it could be some kind

433
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,066
of an animal that could
make a noise like that?

434
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:56,436
Usually, mostly, that's what it is.

435
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,137
Now, what kind of an
animal are we talking about?

436
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,707
- Raccoons, possums.
- Okay.

437
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:01,808
Family of squirrels.

438
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,043
Okay, so if you can
find evidence of that,

439
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:07,513
at least I could tell them
this is why you're hearing this.

440
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:08,982
So if you can get to work on it for me,

441
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,450
and I'll get back with
you when you're done.

442
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:11,884
- I could sure do that for you.
- Okay, excellent.

443
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:12,885
- Thank you, buddy.
- You got it.

444
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,187
- Appreciate it. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,229
With all the bizarre sounds

446
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,862
Annette and William are hearing,

447
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:22,830
I know I have to rule
out the obvious first.

448
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,666
And if there isn't a
physical explanation,

449
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:27,235
our only hope for answers
will have to come from Amy.

450
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,670
All right, Jessie, so what's the story?

451
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:32,440
I found zero signs of
activity during my inspection.

452
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,109
Okay, so there's no chance

453
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,512
that what they're hearing is
caused by any kind of wildlife.

454
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:39,113
Steve, I'm 100% sure.

455
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,682
I appreciate you help
and time. Thank you.

456
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,851
Not a problem at all.

457
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,177
The guy from outside...

458
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,714
the dead guy with lights
is acting really strange.

459
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:54,452
He smushed himself
down, like, to this tall.

460
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,857
Flat.

461
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,327
And then it gets really loud.

462
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,397
It's super, super loud.

463
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,337
When he does that, it's a problem.

464
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,705
What do you mean?

465
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,674
It's a problem because

466
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,778
the dead ladies freak out.

467
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,417
Like, it's like everything is going nuts

468
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,186
because all the other dead
people are losing their minds.

469
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,088
What kind of effect would all this chaos

470
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,323
have on the living?

471
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,858
I think they would hear voices,

472
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:39,998
and there would be, like, a
lot of the feeling of movement.

473
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,067
Like a lot of people moving around.

474
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,937
And so there's all this
pandemonium happening.

475
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:54,144
If you need us to investigate

476
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:55,877
unexplained activity in your home,

477
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:58,246
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

478
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,148
Click on "Help Me, Dead Files"

479
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,917
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

480
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,683
So far, I've got a
family being terrorized in a home

481
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:14,068
whose former owner died
of a massive heart attack,

482
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,201
leaving behind a widow

483
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,536
who believed she could
speak to the dead.

484
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,838
But I need to see if
there's anything else

485
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,907
that can help my investigation.

486
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,209
Searching through old records,

487
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:26,012
I come across a gangster
named Athay Brown.

488
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:27,146
Turns out his gang

489
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:28,914
was responsible for the death of a woman

490
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:33,085
less than a hundred yards
from my clients' property.

491
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,121
Look, when I want to know
the facts about a murder,

492
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,657
there's only one source
I really trust, the cops.

493
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,126
So I'm on my way to meet with
a Cleveland homicide detective

494
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,061
who looked into it for me, and he says

495
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,897
Brown was one of the most
violent and notorious murders

496
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,532
in Cleveland's history.

497
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
So I know you looked
into this local gangster.

498
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:56,375
What can you tell me about the case?

499
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,944
Almost right next door
to your client's property,

500
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,513
there lived a lady named Kerri Sykes.

501
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,350
She was a 63-year-old lady
who claimed to be a psychic.

502
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:05,651
And she did readings for people.

503
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:08,120
Well, on August 30, 1932,

504
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:11,490
Kerri Sykes is at home
with an elderly friend...

505
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:12,858
a 72-year-old
widow,

506
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,428
and these four gangsters
knock on her door.

507
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,464
And they tell them that they're
looking to have a reading.

508
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,532
Athay brown is one of the gang leaders.

509
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,167
Now, you said he was one of Cleveland's

510
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,102
- most dangerous gangsters.
- Yes.

511
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,673
They had done 40 or more
robberies in the Cleveland area

512
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,675
during a six-month period.

513
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,678
They were involved in four murders.

514
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,580
So what happened?

515
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,382
Once she lets them in the house,

516
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,217
they produce pistols,

517
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,686
and they force the women into
the basement and tie them up.

518
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,422
And then begin to ransack the house.

519
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,459
Well, Kerri was able to free
herself and free her companion.

520
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,413
She boosts the
72-year-old lady

521
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,715
up in the basement and
out the basement window.

522
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,583
So the 72-year-old now
is able to run for help.

523
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,018
And now Kerri finds
herself alone in basement,

524
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,054
and she starts to have a panic attack,

525
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,323
and actually causes her
to have a heart attack,

526
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,258
and she dies right
there in the basement.

527
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
How does he wind up getting caught?

528
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:10,463
Well, he actually doesn't get
caught for Kerri Sykes' death.

529
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:11,864
A few weeks later,

530
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,100
he thinks that one of
the members of his gang

531
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,136
is talking to the police about
him, and he gets paranoid.

532
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,538
So him and another gang member

533
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,740
sneak into the snitch's house one night.

534
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,175
And while the snitch

535
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:27,313
is sleeping with his 20-year-old
pregnant wife, they open fire.

536
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,882
They miss the snitch, but
they killed the pregnant wife.

537
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,851
- Oh, [bleep].
- Francine Holt...

538
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:36,356
and I was able to find a copy
of her death certificate for you.

539
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,757
So he jumps back on a train

540
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,059
and heads back to Cleveland,
and the Cleveland police

541
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,328
had been alerted at that time,
and they were waiting for him,

542
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,763
and they arrested him
when he got off the train.

543
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,331
He goes to trial, I guess?

544
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,599
Yes, he goes to trial

545
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:49,636
for the murder of the
20-year-old pregnant lady,

546
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,271
and he's found guilty of that,

547
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:52,772
and he gets sentenced to death.

548
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,741
Do they execute this rat [bleep]?

549
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:56,109
They do.

550
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:59,212
Within a year of Kerri Sykes' death,

551
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:01,848
Athay Brown was put to death
in the Ohio Penitentiary

552
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,316
at the age of 27.

553
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,184
Good. He deserved it.

554
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,039
The guy from
outside...

555
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:15,042
this guy in the light...

556
00:25:15,144 --> 00:25:18,946
he's in here.

557
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:22,850
Whatever he did, he ruined people.

558
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:24,785
He, like, took [bleep]

559
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:29,140
And he would ruin
them, like, financially.

560
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:30,374
Then there was a major thing

561
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:33,945
that actually killed a lot of people.

562
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,154
And it ruined him.

563
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:41,152
The dead teenage girl, he killed her.

564
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:42,987
He's damned because of what he did.

565
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,156
He caused a lot of people to die.

566
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:52,964
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

567
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,832
but two stood out the most.

568
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,168
First, the old man in the basement.

569
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,304
He has thick, white hair,

570
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:02,740
and it's parted.

571
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:08,446
His nose was very, very large.

572
00:26:08,548 --> 00:26:10,682
Next, I describe the dead teenage girl

573
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,850
talking to a living woman.

574
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:15,553
It was in a bedroom.

575
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,727
She is in the process of decomposing.

576
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:29,635
Amy, is this what you saw?

577
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,403
Yes, that's what I saw.

578
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:54,005
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

579
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,471
we're ready to reveal our findings

580
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,073
to each other and our clients

581
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:58,341
for the first time.

582
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:02,378
Well, Amy, this is William
and this is Annette.

583
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,881
These guys are all about
one thing... family...

584
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,048
and they have a big one,

585
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:08,885
seven kids, including Nikki here,

586
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:11,587
and 11 grandchildren.

587
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,456
And that's the reason they called us in.

588
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:15,291
The activity here is so bad,

589
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,493
it's tearing the family apart.

590
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,862
No one wants to be here,

591
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:22,465
and the kids are worried
that Annette and William

592
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,933
are in danger.

593
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,835
Now that Amy knows a
little bit about you guys,

594
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,906
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk.

595
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:33,908
So the worst place
for me in the house

596
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,711
was when I went into the basement

597
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,679
and I became, like,

598
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,750
extremely anxious and,
like, overwhelming panic.

599
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,019
And I saw this man there.

600
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,055
And he apparently is,

601
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:50,654
like, reliving his death
over and over and over again.

602
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:54,429
I didn't know how anybody
could go down there and,

603
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,997
like, do laundry or anything

604
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,167
because his energy is so negative.

605
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:01,436
You just feel horrible.

606
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,165
And also I think that

607
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,666
anybody alive would
feel extremely drained,

608
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:11,503
and they would feel like a
sense of, like, impending doom.

609
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,174
A lot of our family have had
experiences in the basement

610
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,041
in seeing a man in that area.

611
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:20,123
I was in the basement,

612
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:21,357
and I woke up,

613
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:23,760
and I saw this man
coming down the stairs.

614
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,161
And you were sleeping down there?

615
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:26,829
That was it for me.

616
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:29,165
I think that things like that only

617
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,035
happen to people in the movies,

618
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:35,405
and it's terrifying to
even see it and feel it...

619
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,609
and to be in your family's
house and experience it.

620
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,477
All right, so we know this
guy's causing problems.

621
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:43,112
Any idea who he was?

622
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:47,550
I thought that
this man owns this house,

623
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:51,454
that he died in the house.

624
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:53,056
I'm not sure how he died,

625
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:56,726
but I was feeling like
an aneurysm or a stroke.

626
00:28:56,828 --> 00:28:59,429
I got that he was
within the last 30 years.

627
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:02,398
He was 68 years old when he died.

628
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,533
Wow.

629
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:07,070
- And he had thick, white hair.
- Wow.

630
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,672
I don't have to think
too long about this one.

631
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:12,342
Now you said the guy
you saw owned the home,

632
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:16,112
died in the home, and
died at the age of 68.

633
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,114
Now, the first owner of the house

634
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,017
was this guy named Valentine Carpozi.

635
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,221
Well, in 1978, Valentine,
at the age of 66,

636
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:28,491
has a massive heart attack
in the living room here.

637
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,312
And was declared dead an hour later.

638
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:31,844
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

639
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:35,348
Now, I do have his
death certificate here.

640
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,350
He officially died at the hospital,

641
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,185
but in my experience, when somebody

642
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:40,553
has a massive heart attack,

643
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,588
- they're usually dead right away.
- Right.

644
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:45,658
Now I did manage to
track down a photo of him

645
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,561
with his second wife, Eleanor.

646
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:51,795
What do you think
when you see the photo?

647
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:54,164
Well, I did have a sketch of him.

648
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,403
I'm pretty sure this is the same guy,

649
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:01,704
but you guys tell me.

650
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:03,306
Take a look at the photo
and the sketch together.

651
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:07,944
Yep.

652
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,045
It resembles the guy that I saw.

653
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:14,250
That could be the person
that's looking in on me.

654
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:20,023
So there are two
separate deceased females

655
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,927
that are in the house and are active.

656
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,463
What I got was that
they're both murder victims.

657
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,565
One of the females

658
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:33,403
is mentally ill and
stuck in her death state,

659
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:38,708
and she's reliving the pain of
her murder over and over again.

660
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,976
I'm thinking, well,

661
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:42,745
it may be a stab wound,
gunshot, I'm not sure.

662
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:45,448
All I know is that she bled out.

663
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,317
The other female is a teenager.

664
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:50,620
Her body is decomposing,
she has like a bluish-gray,

665
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:52,956
you know, hue.

666
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:56,226
And with her, I felt sharp neck pains,

667
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:59,262
so I'm thinking she might
have been stabbed there.

668
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:01,030
The thing that I found disturbing

669
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:04,901
about these two females
was that they can't leave.

670
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:09,639
And I actually saw leashes
strapped around them.

671
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:13,877
What I got was that at
some point in this house,

672
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:16,279
somebody was playing with the occult

673
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,848
or some type of witchcraft.

674
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,752
May have been using Ouija
boards or doing seances,

675
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:24,954
and they might not be aware,

676
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:28,157
but they inadvertently
trapped these two females

677
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,726
and made an attachment to them.

678
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:31,861
Oh, my God.

679
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:33,763
Now, everybody in the family

680
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:37,300
that I spoke to said
that they've never messed

681
00:31:37,402 --> 00:31:38,902
with anything like that.

682
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:43,773
But one of the previous
owners of your home did.

683
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,609
And that's Valentine's
second wife, Eleanor.

684
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:50,813
After Valentine died, she
lived here for 21 years alone.

685
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,249
Eleanor was, from what
I was told, religious.

686
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,751
So I met with her pastor.

687
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,352
This is where it gets interesting.

688
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:59,489
The church identifies as
Christian, but also believes

689
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:01,257
- in the paranormal.
- What?

690
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,661
They try to communicate with
the dead during the services.

691
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:05,695
Oh, boy.

692
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:07,130
Could this be the woman

693
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,632
that you think might have been
communicating with the dead?

694
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:10,633
Yes.

695
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:13,536
It makes a lot of sense.

696
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:15,772
So let me ask a question,
what are these two dead women

697
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,073
doing in the house?

698
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:21,052
They spend most of their
time in the back two bedrooms

699
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,652
to the right.

700
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:26,155
Okay, so that's William Jr.'s
room and their master bedroom.

701
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:27,557
Okay.

702
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,228
They do inadvertently
interact with the living a bit.

703
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,666
I would think that you guys
would occasionally see them.

704
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,734
They're rather vocal.

705
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:43,306
I would think that you
guys would hear voices.

706
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:46,075
Now, we could talk about the
woman you saw in the basement.

707
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,279
- Mm-hmm.
- Describe it to Amy.

708
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,680
She was a short lady
with long white hair

709
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,484
and a long white gown.

710
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:55,919
It scared the hell out of me.

711
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:59,422
Have any of you heard,
like, voices at night?

712
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,958
Their son, William Jr.,
did before he moved out.

713
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,760
He couldn't take all the activity.

714
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:07,464
Wow.

715
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:11,634
The younger dead girl
likes to spend a lot of time

716
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:14,204
in the master bedroom.

717
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,606
I saw her sitting on the floor

718
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:20,810
and talking to the female in the bed.

719
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:24,447
The living person may not
know that this is happening

720
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,418
because it would seem like
more like sleep talking.

721
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,521
We didn't share that.

722
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:36,993
That for the past two years

723
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,996
I've started talking in my sleep.

724
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:45,969
And William says I have a full
conversation that wakes him up.

725
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,171
I drew a sketch

726
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:54,577
of what I saw happening
between these two individuals.

727
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,079
Are you guys ready for this?

728
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,727
You're gonna be shocked
when you see this.

729
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:07,122
God.

730
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:13,155
That's exactly what I saw.

731
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,323
It's when she turned,

732
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:16,725
her face was like a
gargoyle or something.

733
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:19,194
It was exactly what I saw.

734
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:23,832
And that's your only conscious
interaction that you recall?

735
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,702
Other than my name being called.

736
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:28,070
Okay, okay.

737
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:30,906
Like, someone's always
trying to get my attention.

738
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:32,913
I'm getting the hell out of this house.

739
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:39,418
The last person I encountered

740
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:42,485
really concerned me.

741
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:44,354
The first time I saw him,

742
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,656
it was really weird because

743
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:50,460
he surrounds himself with light.

744
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:53,630
I come downstairs about
8:00 in the morning,

745
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:59,502
and... a body over light...

746
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:03,840
like, sparkles... tons of
them coming up the steps.

747
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,476
When I come down, it
stopped, and I stopped,

748
00:35:06,578 --> 00:35:08,578
- and we're staring at each other.
- Wow.

749
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,381
But my whole body was just shaking.

750
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,082
So what else does this guy do?

751
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,118
He figures out

752
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,054
what means the most to
the people in the house,

753
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:19,422
what they love the most,

754
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:22,192
what they're most passionate about,

755
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:25,528
and then he tries to
take it away from them.

756
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,098
Now, what's the one thing
that would destroy your life?

757
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,935
Losing my family.

758
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:34,771
Is that what he's trying to do?

759
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:40,376
What I saw was that he
would smush himself down

760
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,679
and then raise up from the ground.

761
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,048
When he does that kind of stuff,

762
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,284
the dead women freak out.

763
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,221
And what I saw was
just like pandemonium.

764
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,690
I'm like, I think that
the living here would feel

765
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:57,560
like this chaos, this movement
of people rushing around.

766
00:35:57,662 --> 00:36:00,129
And that's when he's...

767
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:03,499
he's in the room doing that.

768
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:05,835
Tell her your number one
complaint about the footsteps.

769
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:08,104
We can be in the
basement, and you hear...

770
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:11,274
That loud.

771
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:15,745
The first time we heard it, we
thought someone had broke in.

772
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:18,014
I brought in a pest control
specialist just to check it out,

773
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:20,149
to be on the safe side.

774
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,748
He didn't find a thing.

775
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,491
So this guy with the lights,
any clue who he was in life?

776
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:30,127
He was not a good
person when he was alive.

777
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,929
He said that he ruined people,

778
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,765
he was a thief, that he would
take things from people...

779
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,300
like their land or business.

780
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,070
He also caused a lot of people to die.

781
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:45,042
At one point, the younger girl

782
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:50,013
pointed at him and said that
he was the one who murdered her.

783
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:56,019
He believes that the situation
that he's in now is hell.

784
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,475
He wants out, but he feels
like he's damned himself.

785
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,409
I came across somebody in my research

786
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:06,745
that may fit the bill about
who she's talking about.

787
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:08,613
A notorious gangster, actually,

788
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:12,217
that terrorized this area in 1932.

789
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,486
His name was Athay Brown.

790
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:18,256
I've actually got a photo of him.

791
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:19,524
He worked with his wife, Rose,

792
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:23,328
and a couple other gang
members in the area here.

793
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,831
Now, in a six-month span,
they committed 40 robberies

794
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,934
and murdered four
people that we know of.

795
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:30,302
What?!

796
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:33,138
Now, Brown and his crew,

797
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,309
back on August 30, 1932,

798
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,278
hit a home about 100
yards from this house.

799
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,371
The woman who lived there,
Kerri Sykes, was a psychic.

800
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:45,508
She had an elderly friend over.

801
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,976
When she opened the door,

802
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,578
they pulled out their guns,
brought them into the basement,

803
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:50,713
tied them up.

804
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:53,082
While the guys were
ransacking the house,

805
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,118
Kerri wound up dying of a
heart attack in the basement.

806
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,521
Five weeks later,

807
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:03,859
he broke into a gang member's
house to kill him for snitching.

808
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:06,862
Instead, he accidentally shot and killed

809
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,632
the guy's 20-year-old
pregnant wife.

810
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:12,468
Her name was Francis Holt.

811
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,738
And I got her death certificate as well.

812
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
He was convicted of
first-degree murder.

813
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,499
On March 10, 1933,

814
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,600
Athay was electrocuted at
the Ohio State Penitentiary.

815
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:25,636
Now, he was only 27 years old.

816
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,574
I don't think we'll know for sure

817
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:32,210
if it's this man, but it's possible.

818
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:36,013
All right, so, we don't
know who the guy is,

819
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:40,218
but what does he want with
our beautiful family here?

820
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,189
His thing is is that he
wants to hurt people here.

821
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,961
His purpose being that
he needs to destroy.

822
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,063
I'm terrified.

823
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,699
How much more that we can take of this?

824
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,200
It's destroying my family.

825
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:59,370
Things are just out of whack here.

826
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:14,367
Annette, when we first met,

827
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,529
you told me your motto is don't
mess with my family or my home.

828
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:18,594
Yes.

829
00:39:18,696 --> 00:39:20,963
Now we know what's
been messing with both.

830
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:24,801
The question is can you
kick out the rat [bleep]

831
00:39:24,903 --> 00:39:26,836
That's responsible for
trying to destroy your family

832
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:29,739
and get your life back the
way you guys want it to be?

833
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:34,277
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

834
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:37,780
You could move.

835
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:41,584
That would be really
the easiest thing to do.

836
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:44,720
But there would still be all this mess

837
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:47,924
here for the next people.

838
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:50,092
But if you're really determined to stay,

839
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:55,665
what needs to be done would be
to reach out to the pastor...

840
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:56,833
Mm-hmm.

841
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,568
Of this church

842
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,338
and have him create a team

843
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,174
of his best sensitives.

844
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:10,146
And, basically, they would
have it out with Eleanor.

845
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:12,148
Fight fire with fire.

846
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,584
Once she's removed,

847
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:19,088
the two dead women
will be able to move on.

848
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,026
But her husband would
need more assistance

849
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:30,132
because he's so confused
by what's going on.

850
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:31,767
Once that's been done,

851
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,305
then the killer, obviously,
needs to be addressed.

852
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:39,442
And what would happen there would be

853
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:43,980
the sensitives would actually
summon him and let him know

854
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:46,515
that he's able to leave.

855
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:50,019
The only good thing about
him is that he actually

856
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:51,854
does want to go,

857
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:56,200
but he's made himself believe he can't.

858
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:58,828
William, what are you thinking?

859
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,531
Move.

860
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:05,568
Even if we did get rid
of stuff like that, man,

861
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,703
it's just too much still.

862
00:41:07,805 --> 00:41:10,206
You know, you'd still be like,

863
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:12,008
"Is it still here?"

864
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,376
In the back of our
minds, it would be like...

865
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:15,444
- You're traumatized.
- Yeah.

866
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:19,763
Well, Annette, we know
how William and Nikki feel.

867
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:21,563
You still want to fight, though?

868
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,967
This is my home. I've
been here almost 15 years.

869
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:27,903
I've poured my heart and soul into this.

870
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:31,296
This is the heart of the matter.

871
00:41:32,181 --> 00:41:34,714
But in order to get my family back,

872
00:41:34,816 --> 00:41:36,683
I'm willing to do anything.

873
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,080
I wish I had better news
for Annette and her family.

874
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:42,174
But leaving this house
is their best option.

875
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:44,741
If they're not able to move right away,

876
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,342
their only hope is to contact the pastor

877
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,733
to free themselves of the dead trapped inside their home.
