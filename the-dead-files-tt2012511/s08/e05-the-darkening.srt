1
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:11,957
He's agitated.

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,727
He's not happy that I'm here.

3
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,429
It gives me crazy vibes
up and down my spine.

4
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:19,832
He's making the living sick.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,700
To think that whatever's here
is actually picking on you

6
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:22,968
pisses me off.

7
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,170
I have horrible nightmares.

8
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:26,972
He is...

9
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,907
an evil lunatic.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,049
This is bad, bad stuff all around.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,425
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,559
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:39,561
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:40,962
They're from hell.

15
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:42,063
I see dead people.

16
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:43,331
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,100
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,001
They were setting people on fire,

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,136
burning them alive.

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:49,637
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,939
Her neck got broken.

22
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,908
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,777
I hear a gunshot.

24
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,345
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:00,815
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,016
Something's not right here.

28
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,353
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:06,393
It's not safe here.

30
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,209
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:09,561
Are any of them buried on the property?

32
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:10,629
They're all buried here.

33
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:12,297
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,389
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:15,789
Until the very end...

36
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:17,090
I can't do it no more.

37
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,125
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,994
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

39
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,295
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:23,763
It does not have a happy ending.

41
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:26,032
Something kills people here.

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,648
I'm in Wausau, Wisconsin,

43
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,165
about an hour and a half from Green Bay.

44
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,572
I didn't think long
about taking on this case.

45
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,240
I received a call from a mother of four

46
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,092
who just moved into a new townhouse

47
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,261
and says the entire
family's under attack.

48
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,379
Now, to make things worse,

49
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,582
she has a degenerative eye disease

50
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,550
and now is legally blind.

51
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,735
Her story really touched my heart,

52
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,320
and I hope we can bring
this woman some peace.

53
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,969
Before Amy arrives...

54
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,772
I clear the area of
any leading information...

55
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,477
covering personal items

56
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:19,997
and removing family photos
that may influence her findings.

57
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,350
When I'm done,

58
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:25,769
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

59
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:43,287
There's a lot going on around here.

60
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,389
There's a lady...

61
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:48,625
she's got a really bad vibe to her.

62
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,712
She's claiming to be either Death

63
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,981
or associated with Death.

64
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:58,986
Ahh, this is a disaster.

65
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:01,889
There's a jerk,

66
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,425
and he's not happy that I'm here.

67
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:07,109
He said something about
trying to stab me in the eye

68
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,310
with, like, needles.

69
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,664
So, Beth, when I
spoke to you on the phone,

70
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:22,130
it was obvious that your problems here

71
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,398
are pretty intense.

72
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,633
Before we even get to that,

73
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,435
I want to talk about
your medical condition.

74
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:28,003
You're going blind.

75
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:31,707
Yes, just been slowly going
blind since I was like five.

76
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,909
Can you explain to me what
you're seeing right now?

77
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:34,910
Do you see me?

78
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:35,944
The clothes you're wearing are dark,

79
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,896
and I can't see detail.

80
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,115
Okay, and how much
time do you have left?

81
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,834
- Maybe a couple months.
- Wow.

82
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,019
I mean, it breaks my heart.

83
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,871
It's one of the main
reasons I took this case.

84
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,791
How long have you guys been here?

85
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,193
We've only been here
for like four months.

86
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:55,397
<i>The last two places we
were at got really intense.</i>

87
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,782
It's happened pretty much
everywhere we've lived.

88
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,748
- But now you bought this place?
- Yes.

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,518
We can't just up and leave
like we did the last two houses.

90
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,621
Who exactly lives here
in the house with you?

91
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:10,758
It's me, my fiancÃ©,
Klay, our 4 kids...

92
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,129
- Jeanette, she's 16, Mitchell, he's 14.
- Okay.

93
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,932
Kayleigh's seven, and
then Klayton is six.

94
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,968
Okay, so, why don't you take
me through what's going on?

95
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,236
You can hear stomping,

96
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,373
you'll hear walking
up and down the stairs,

97
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:28,862
see a lot of dark shadows,
and you'll hear voices.

98
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,430
You feel like you're being watched 24/7,

99
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:32,464
everywhere you are.

100
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:35,450
And it's started getting physical now.

101
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,569
And I got to assume this
is frightening the kids.

102
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,137
We all sleep in here.

103
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:40,180
This is where we all come.

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,414
We move the table, and we
make a bed on the floor.

105
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,582
- All you guys?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,551
Nobody wants to be in their room.

107
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,920
I'm scared to death of my bedroom.

108
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,555
When you guys are all
sleeping down here,

109
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,057
does that make things
better for you guys?

110
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,091
No, not really.

111
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,927
I've started getting
a little bit drained,

112
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,296
feeling more tired than usual.

113
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,933
The kids complain about
stomachaches and headaches.

114
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,536
As the activity intensifies,

115
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,679
so does, like, the health issues.

116
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,529
To think that whatever's here
is actually picking on you

117
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:09,830
pisses me off...

118
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,782
I mean, to the point where
I want to strangle somebody.

119
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,518
I don't know how you're
as composed as you are.

120
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,686
I just...

121
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,689
learned to keep my
composure very well.

122
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:20,291
I have to.

123
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,759
I just don't really have a choice.

124
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:23,661
- I have to do it for the kids.
- Right.

125
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,996
'Cause they're my first concern.

126
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,900
You okay?

127
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,635
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

128
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,839
I know.

129
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:38,125
You know, you're allowed to
break down once in awhile.

130
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,783
I just don't want my kids to
have to rely on everybody else.

131
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,284
I should be the one

132
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,819
that is able to take care of them

133
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:49,970
and protect them and...

134
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,772
Yeah, but you can't
do it all by yourself.

135
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,170
"Dire."

136
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:08,839
"Dire."

137
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,074
"Dire, dire."

138
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:11,685
Ah, somebody keeps yelling that.

139
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,887
Okay, okay.

140
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,657
Somebody here is affected

141
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,727
by the energy here,

142
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,014
which is making them...

143
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,582
like, disoriented.

144
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,270
They can't...

145
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,822
function properly.

146
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,527
I think that it's making
them feel sick, drained.

147
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,263
Mm.

148
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,266
Very... bad.

149
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:51,848
You know, Beth, looking around,

150
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,298
you guys obviously haven't
really moved in yet.

151
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:57,199
We don't use this room, really.

152
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,483
'Cause you guys are downstairs.

153
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,451
Yeah.

154
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,836
Okay, so, what's happening up here

155
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,137
that's scaring you guys off?

156
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,823
You can hear walking around up here

157
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,691
when everyone's sleeping.

158
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,293
Well, you got six people
living in the house.

159
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,479
- Kids sleepwalk or anything like that?
- No.

160
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:11,646
How often are you hearing that?

161
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,181
Daily. Okay.

162
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:14,316
Anything else up here?

163
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,468
Shadows, lots of shadows.

164
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm not trying to be mean,
but you have this eye problem.

165
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:20,639
You're seeing shadows
because of your eyes?

166
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,657
No, I don't think so.

167
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,092
Everyone else has seen them.

168
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,599
Death Lady is...

169
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,800
happy.

170
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,686
She seems...

171
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,488
excited and enthusiastic.

172
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,683
She wants me to go upstairs.

173
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,172
Mm.

174
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,062
She tells me that she has a
lot of business in this area.

175
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,448
I'm gonna assume that that means

176
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,868
that a lot of people die
around here very often.

177
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,772
Most people imagine Death
looking like the Grim Reaper,

178
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:06,843
but it can project
itself any way it wants.

179
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,145
And for some reason,
it's showing itself to me

180
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,514
as a short woman with a wide hat.

181
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,552
Ugh. Geez.

182
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,554
It's hard to breathe.

183
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,855
There's a lot of crying...

184
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,995
hyperventilating.

185
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,597
- The living, you're talking about?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

186
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:30,350
Like, freaking out.

187
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,685
This is bad, bad stuff all around.

188
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,246
So, Jeanette,
I was talking to Mom.

189
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,881
She says she relies on you a lot.

190
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,116
I'm the oldest. I'm
like her second eyes.

191
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,202
- How old are you?
- I'm 16.

192
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,870
That's a lot for a
16-year-old to have to take on.

193
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,091
Yeah.

194
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,491
So, what kind of things
are happening to you?

195
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:55,726
What's going on?

196
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,312
I'm seeing a tall black
figure that looks like a human,

197
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,696
but just black shadow.

198
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,266
And would you say it
was a male or a female?

199
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:02,908
Male.

200
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:04,301
Anything face...

201
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:05,698
could you see any face,
or it was all black?

202
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:06,144
All black.

203
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,446
You blink, and then it's gone.

204
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,605
Okay, now, where are you seeing it?

205
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,007
I always see it upstairs.

206
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,742
It just happened yesterday.

207
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:13,826
I was going to sleep,

208
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,878
and I got this feeling of being watched.

209
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,380
And I turned around,

210
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:20,583
and there's that black figure
standing in front of my door.

211
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:21,751
So, what happens?

212
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:22,635
I screamed,

213
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,687
and I ran straight downstairs.

214
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:25,855
Okay, interesting.

215
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,285
Do you have anything else going on?

216
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:30,069
Yes, there are times when
I wake up in the morning,

217
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:31,854
and I'll have these bruises.

218
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,256
They're usually always on my legs.

219
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,192
In fact, I woke up
with one this morning.

220
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,197
Well, that could almost
anything, sweetie.

221
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,598
You might have a deficiency
in a vitamin or something.

222
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,167
- But you don't know how you've done it?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,582
I don't remember hitting
myself on anything.

224
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,148
Okay, so you're just
waking up like that.

225
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:50,416
Yes.

226
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,001
How do you even sleep at night?

227
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,286
It's hard to sleep.

228
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:56,756
And whenever I do fall asleep,
I have horrible nightmares.

229
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:03,963
Mnh-mnh.

230
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,368
Death Lady a lot in here.

231
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:14,173
Well, she does come through
the door in the closet.

232
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,810
A creepy guy comes
in here, too...

233
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,146
the one who threatened me outside.

234
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,083
Do you have any idea
if anybody's seen him?

235
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:26,386
He's pretty [bleep] strong,

236
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:29,322
so I would assume it's a possibility.

237
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,541
There is a girl...

238
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,859
a teenager, getting choked.

239
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,878
I think maybe he's the
one who's choking her.

240
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,631
And he's influencing this girl,

241
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,833
making bad thoughts in her head

242
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:44,404
to do things to herself
that are not good.

243
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:45,638
Death cannot intervene.

244
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,508
It can only watch, wait.

245
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,546
Why is he doing this?

246
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,649
Because he is an evil lunatic.

247
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,942
I understand that you guys
only lived here a few months

248
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,776
and some things have been going on.

249
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,945
Okay. So, Kayleigh, how old are you?

250
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:26,680
- Seven.
- Seven.

251
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,083
- And, Klayton, how old are you, buddy?
- Six.

252
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,217
Why don't you, Kayleigh,

253
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:31,685
tell me one thing that's happened

254
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,320
that you can remember?

255
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:35,222
Upstairs in my bedroom,

256
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:39,260
someone was looking through the window.

257
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:41,162
I think it was a man.

258
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,746
Do you know if he was a man like me?

259
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,198
Was he an older man, white man?

260
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
He was all black.

261
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:47,685
How about you, buddy?

262
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,003
Did you ever see anything like that?

263
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:53,607
I know I saw that down
here in the window.

264
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:54,742
Which window?

265
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:55,626
In here.

266
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,278
In the kitchen here?

267
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,729
Can you tell me what he looked like?

268
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,147
Black in color.

269
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,249
Okay, did he frighten you?

270
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,284
He did.

271
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,586
- So, anything else happen to you?
- Mm...

272
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,023
I remember when I was asleep,

273
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,158
and then I was getting poked.

274
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,793
Show me how you got poked.

275
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:14,028
Let me feel it.

276
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,962
Like that?

277
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,447
Okay, did it wake you up?

278
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,900
You guys like living here?

279
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,919
- Mnh-mnh.
- Not that much.

280
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:27,707
We only sleep downstairs
'cause we're scared a lot.

281
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,344
Oh, God.

282
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:32,412
You all right?

283
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,814
I think I might have to leave soon.

284
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,049
What's going on?

285
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:37,584
The guy...

286
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,319
What is he doing to you?

287
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:42,856
He keeps, like, touching me and...

288
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,189
making me feel sick.

289
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,271
Is this something he
does to the living, also?

290
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,240
I think that's possible.

291
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:52,976
Yeah.

292
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,719
I was talking to Beth
about what's going on,

293
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,318
and I tell you, she breaks my heart.

294
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,721
- Strong woman, though.
- Very, very.

295
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,990
You got to be worried
about her, I would think.

296
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:14,227
I worry about everyone.

297
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:15,996
I mean, I look at
her, and I want to cry.

298
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay. You know, we
bought it, and we want...

299
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:22,969
I want this to be our home.

300
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:26,840
Like, this is our final
resting spot for Beth 'cause...

301
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,843
or I say it's gonna be gone.

302
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,413
I mean, I'm worried more
about somebody getting hurt.

303
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,514
Right.

304
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,400
It gives me crazy vibes
up and down my spine.

305
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,869
What about you? Have
you experienced anything?

306
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:40,904
Yeah.

307
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,056
Sitting down, just
chilling, watching TV,

308
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:45,025
and I'm just sitting in my chair,

309
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,761
and something just came right past me.

310
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:49,646
You know, it was tall...

311
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,299
well, probably at least six foot...

312
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:55,535
kind of, like,
dark-in-the-middle figure

313
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,838
with a light glow around it.

314
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,607
So I got up out of my chair,

315
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,276
and I walked in the
kitchen, and nobody there.

316
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:04,978
I went into the garage.

317
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,580
And I looked, and nothing.

318
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:07,914
That was whacked.

319
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,333
It was shortly after my brother died.

320
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,219
And my mother passed,
and then my brother died.

321
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,689
I lost like seven,
eight, nine family members

322
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:17,524
in like a matter of two years.

323
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,794
I asked the good Lord...

324
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,966
try to stay strong.

325
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:27,384
When you saw the shadow,

326
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:30,403
you thought maybe it was
somebody from the family.

327
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,479
The energy down here

328
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:42,165
is almost like you can grab it.

329
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,250
It's so thick.

330
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:48,421
The creepy guy from upstairs
likes it down here, too.

331
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,175
And he's being bad.

332
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,643
He's influencing living people here.

333
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:55,878
He's really good

334
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:59,148
at making physical connections

335
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,316
with living people.

336
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,516
Yeah, he's not doing good stuff.

337
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,516
He's making the living sick.

338
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,518
He's hurting them.

339
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,855
Mm. Interesting.

340
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:10,856
He's...

341
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,392
He's very strong.

342
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:18,346
Very, actually... very, very
[bleep] very [bleep] strong.

343
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:23,969
You got a problem with people
getting physically touched here,

344
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,605
you know, and keeping
you guys up at night.

345
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,673
You know, it's not good.

346
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,475
There's definitely something.

347
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,344
I'd really like to stay.

348
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:35,247
I love her to death,
and I'm here for her.

349
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,250
I worry more about them than myself,

350
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,635
'cause they're the ones
that are suffering more.

351
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,588
You know, that's what I'm here for.

352
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:46,854
We'll do the best we can.

353
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,972
Appreciate it.

354
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,790
Ah, no worries.

355
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,827
You're so welcome.

356
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:54,795
You'll be all right, trust me.

357
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:14,369
I started making some calls
and found something surprising.

358
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,275
Beth and Klay's property

359
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,815
used to be part of a large factory.

360
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,831
Apparently, they used to
make fly swatters there.

361
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,167
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

362
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,451
who said there was nothing funny

363
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,791
about what happened to
the owner of that business.

364
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,743
So, Shawn, you
mentioned on the phone

365
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,312
that factory sitting
on my client's property

366
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:35,814
at one time made fly swatters.

367
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,148
- Is that right?
- Correct.

368
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:38,199
What's the story with that?

369
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:40,252
Well, Arthur Hurd and George Wilson

370
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,737
purchased your client's
property around 1908,

371
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:44,856
and by 1910, they had
a factory built there.

372
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,709
I have a map here that kind
of shows where the factory was.

373
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:52,030
<i>It sat right where your
client's house is right now.</i>

374
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:55,884
This is actually what
the factory looked like.

375
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,420
You said things went bad for these guys.

376
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,653
What happened?

377
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,956
By 1911, Wilson left the company

378
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:05,042
and left Mr. Hurd by himself
to try to run the place.

379
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,328
All right, so, how's it
go for Hurd at this point?

380
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,796
Well, it was a struggle for him.

381
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:11,132
He didn't have the expertise
that his partner had,

382
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,034
but he continued to work forward,

383
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,202
and he put his heart
and soul into running it.

384
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,838
And I think it became
pretty stressful on him,

385
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,207
and February 3rd of 1925,

386
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,409
he actually suffered a heart attack

387
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:22,443
at the site.

388
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:23,481
In the factory?

389
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:24,497
Correct.

390
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:26,165
Here's actually his death certificate.

391
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,787
And he was pretty influential
in the town because,

392
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,139
right on the front page,

393
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,890
they put in his obituary that day.

394
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,196
I saw a very different
structure than this one.

395
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:44,383
The structure seemed large.

396
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:48,337
I think it had bricks.

397
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,408
There's a guy...

398
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,510
he's agitated.

399
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,380
He's very high-strung,

400
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,883
and this is his territory,

401
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:04,153
and he had to, I guess,
fight really hard for it.

402
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:08,123
This guy is not dealing
with his death very well.

403
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,060
I'm gonna say he died from, like,

404
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,962
a stroke or a heart attack.

405
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,133
After finding out that a factory

406
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,135
used to sit right on
my client's property

407
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,105
and that the owner basically
worked himself to death,

408
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,139
I hit the local library

409
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:24,373
to see if there was anything else

410
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:25,708
that could help my investigation.

411
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,379
Turns out, a massive
insane asylum and poor farm

412
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:32,014
operated for nearly 80 years

413
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,584
right next to Beth
and Klayton's property.

414
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:37,953
You know, from doing
these investigations,

415
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,103
I know a lot of these poor
farms and mental asylums

416
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,555
mistreated their patients.

417
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,308
So I reached out to a
local newspaper reporter.

418
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:47,411
He said this place was filled
with neglect, abuse, and death.

419
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:57,371
So, Keith, the asylum seemed
like it was really close

420
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,672
to my client's original property line.

421
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:00,307
- Is that right?
- That's right.

422
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,593
And as a matter of fact, you can see it.

423
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,845
It's right over there across the river.

424
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,930
Were you able to find out
when this place was built?

425
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:09,066
Yeah, it was built in 1893.

426
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,870
It was in operation for about 78 years.

427
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,288
How many people did this house?

428
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,623
It was big. It would've
housed up to about 300 people.

429
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,893
What kind of people would
actually be treated at this place?

430
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:21,762
There'd been schizophrenics.

431
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:24,014
There would've been manic-depressives.

432
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,799
There would've been the elderly.

433
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,818
Now, you mentioned on the phone
how bad the conditions were.

434
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:28,869
What are we talking about?

435
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:30,671
In the 1950s, the superintendents

436
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:33,841
came under investigation
by the Marathon County D.A.

437
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,084
for overcrowded conditions,
limited staffing.

438
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,784
There were hundreds of people there.

439
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,838
They only had four bathtubs.

440
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,272
So, when I first contacted you,

441
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,575
I asked you to find out if
there was any unusual deaths

442
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,626
that might help my case.

443
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,161
Were you able to come up with anything?

444
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,229
Yeah, I found five interesting deaths.

445
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,548
The first one was in 1895,

446
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,017
when an inmate hung himself.

447
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:00,856
In 1899, three men were asphyxiated

448
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:02,824
while working in a silo on the farm.

449
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,962
In 1903, a 37-year-old inmate

450
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:09,347
was stabbed to death by
an 85-year-old inmate.

451
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,532
What was it over?

452
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,717
I guess it was over living quarters.

453
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:13,919
Couple more.

454
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,339
In 1920, a man named
John Kyough told nurses

455
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,908
that he was gonna go
fishing down on the river.

456
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,443
He had a wooden leg.

457
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:24,679
He removed it, tied
an anchor to his waist,

458
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,298
threw himself in the river.

459
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,173
You said there was
five. What was the fifth?

460
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,826
Yeah, there was one more inmate suicide.

461
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,728
This one happened in 1933.

462
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,948
He laid down on a stick of dynamite

463
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,783
and blew himself up.

464
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,085
That's a lot of death.

465
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:44,037
These are the ones we know about.

466
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:47,024
There certainly would've had
to been a lot more deaths.

467
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:50,577
Nurses reported that they didn't
even bother keeping records,

468
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,579
'cause once people were brought in,

469
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:55,766
they just expected them to be
there forever till they died.

470
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,001
Okay.

471
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:01,472
I hear a male, and he said,

472
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,410
"We are lost and need help out of here."

473
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,344
And he said,

474
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:09,679
"We can't see to find our way out."

475
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,481
There's about 11 of them.

476
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,151
They can't even see each other.

477
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,253
I asked how did he die?

478
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,455
He said, "A death camp."

479
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:49,357
One other thing got my
attention during my research.

480
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:52,444
There was a brutal murder about
1,200 feet from Beth's house.

481
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,045
The victim was a young woman
heading home from church.

482
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,680
Now, look, it may be a long shot,

483
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,899
but I'm heading over to
meet with a Wausau detective

484
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,951
who said it was one of
the most notorious crimes

485
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:01,952
in the city's history.

486
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,776
So, Greg, I came across this homicide

487
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:12,978
that happened pretty close
to my client's property.

488
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,313
What do you know about it?

489
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,083
Murder happened on April 18, 1966.

490
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,437
This is our victim...
Mary Holzem, 26 years old.

491
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:22,438
This is the guy
that killed her...

492
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:25,191
Eugene Schopf, 29 years old.

493
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,609
All right, so, how's
the homicide go down?

494
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:28,928
Mary, she was walking home from church.

495
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,697
Eugene Schopf here, he
picks her up in a vehicle.

496
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,999
They go down to a bar, and
they have a couple of drinks,

497
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:35,668
and then they leave
together in a vehicle.

498
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,536
And that's the last anybody sees of her.

499
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:39,805
So, what happens after that?

500
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:43,843
He was somewhat infatuated
with her and came on to her.

501
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:46,445
She resisted, and he
stabbed her three times.

502
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,813
She screamed...

503
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,148
and then he cut her throat.

504
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,783
Oof.

505
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:52,774
This is a copy of Mary
Holzem's death certificate.

506
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:56,241
"Male subject apparently seduced victim

507
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,176
to a secluded spot for his act."

508
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:01,771
So, Greg, the actual
location of the homicide,

509
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:04,040
how far is that from
my client's location?

510
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:05,708
That was about a quarter of a mile.

511
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,711
<i>Okay, so, now, from the article,
I understand he was caught.</i>

512
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,388
How'd they wind up getting him?

513
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:14,083
Police received a call
at about 10:45 that night

514
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,053
that there was screaming
coming from an area

515
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:18,755
just two blocks down from that bar.

516
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,723
Police officers go over to the bar,

517
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:21,808
talk to the bartender.

518
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,928
Bartender tells them,
"Yep, Mary was in here,

519
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,480
and she was with a guy by
the name of Gene Schopf.

520
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,765
So they knew the guy.

521
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,300
They knew the guy.

522
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:31,868
They go down to his house.

523
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,052
They look at the vehicle,

524
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,304
they find blood in the trunk,

525
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:35,972
they find bloody
clothes in the back seat.

526
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:38,039
Gene confesses to killing her.

527
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:41,169
That's his booking photo from the 19th,

528
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:43,538
- the day after she was killed.
- Okay.

529
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,906
He was charged with
first-degree murder.

530
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,574
Wow.

531
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:56,851
Ah, there's a man and a woman,

532
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,054
and the man is the creepy guy.

533
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:02,223
They're both dead, and...

534
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,960
It's bad. It's so bad. It's so bad.

535
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,263
They knew each other
when they were alive.

536
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,665
And she's always...

537
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:13,902
trying to get away from him...

538
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,437
still.

539
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:20,375
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

540
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:22,744
Her heart's racing,

541
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:26,514
'cause she's got to get away.

542
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,516
And she's...

543
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:31,019
very stressed-out.

544
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:34,689
I think that the woman died here.

545
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:40,796
I saw knives...

546
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:44,500
somebody messing with knives.

547
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:49,371
Okay, so, what happens at the trial?

548
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:52,147
He goes to court and pleads "not
guilty by reason of insanity."

549
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,646
It's a pretty brutal crime.

550
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:56,015
Is there any indication
he's done this before?

551
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,651
It came out that, in 1954,

552
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:01,854
he had asked military doctors for help

553
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,489
because he had thoughts

554
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:06,425
of slicing the throats of animals

555
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,327
and he thought he might hurt a woman.

556
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:10,163
- He asked for help.
- He did.

557
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,331
Obviously, he didn't get it,

558
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,168
'cause this guy's got the
markings of a serial killer...

559
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:16,469
especially with the animals.

560
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:17,587
Yeah.

561
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:19,639
In July of 1966,

562
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:22,058
<i>he was found "not guilty
by reason of insanity."</i>

563
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:25,111
He was committed to a
state mental institution

564
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,546
in Waupun, Wisconsin.

565
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:28,915
In the early '70s, he was released.

566
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,349
That son of a [bleep]

567
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:32,652
Can't believe they let this guy out.

568
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:34,320
What happened after he was released?

569
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:37,707
Last information we have
is he moves to Alabama

570
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:41,627
and dies in 2002 at age 65.

571
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,132
This creepy guy,

572
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:49,635
he didn't die a long time ago.

573
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:53,673
I don't think he's that old,

574
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:56,976
maybe in his early 50s,

575
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,846
and he does not like animals.

576
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:04,116
And children are pests.

577
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,720
Woman are pests... bad,
evil, evil creatures.

578
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:09,522
They're evil creatures.

579
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:12,508
He is very mentally ill.

580
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:13,392
Mm.

581
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,997
I see 5 and a 4, 54,

582
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:19,832
so...

583
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,250
something like that.

584
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,469
He is evil,

585
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:25,521
and he wants

586
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,208
nothing good for anybody.

587
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:37,550
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

588
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:39,885
but two stood out the most...

589
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:42,338
first, the creepy man
choking a living teenager

590
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:43,389
in the house.

591
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:47,026
He has, like, a huge rope...

592
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:52,465
and he's strangling the kid with it.

593
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:56,135
Over on the side, in
front of this big closet,

594
00:26:56,237 --> 00:27:01,057
is this woman who is really Death,

595
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:05,111
and she's watching this
situation happening.

596
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:08,581
Next, I describe how
Death showed herself to me.

597
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:11,851
She had a... hat on,

598
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,419
and it was black.

599
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,906
She had very large eyes,

600
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:20,893
and she was wearing,
like, a fur-collar thing,

601
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,094
and it was black.

602
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,901
Is this who you saw?

603
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:31,103
Yes, that's who I saw.

604
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,586
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

605
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,752
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

606
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,855
and our clients for the first time.

607
00:27:57,957 --> 00:28:00,924
So, Amy, when I decided that
we should take on this case,

608
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,226
I knew it was gonna be emotional,

609
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,194
but I didn't realize how emotional.

610
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:05,429
This is Beth.

611
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:08,832
She's one of the strongest
women I've ever met.

612
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:12,402
And this is her very
supportive fiancÃ©, Klay.

613
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,639
Now, on top of dealing with a
really bad paranormal problem

614
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:16,874
that they have here,

615
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,692
Beth has a disease that's
gonna leave her blind

616
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,128
within the next three to four months.

617
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:23,630
She called us in

618
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,532
because she's desperate to make sure

619
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:28,685
that their four kids are okay

620
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:31,355
before she goes completely blind.

621
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,325
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about your background,

622
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:39,963
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

623
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:42,165
Honestly, I was not looking forward

624
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,051
to walking through the door,

625
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,254
but I did, and as
soon as I came in here,

626
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:50,173
I was hearing somebody yelling,

627
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,377
"Dire, dire, dire!"

628
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:55,746
Somebody here

629
00:28:55,831 --> 00:29:00,267
is affected by the energy here,

630
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,818
which is making them...

631
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:04,388
like, disoriented.

632
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,108
Then...

633
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:10,260
I went upstairs,

634
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,796
and I was so sick up there.

635
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:16,767
I felt so drained and horrible.

636
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:20,270
I get a lot of headaches.

637
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:21,305
I'm just tired.

638
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,240
I don't want to do anything.

639
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:26,510
I just have, like, absolutely no

640
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,178
"get up and go."

641
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,947
Klay, don't the kids
have stomachaches a lot?

642
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,849
Oh, yeah, they get stomach, headache,

643
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:35,485
and you can tell they're not themselves.

644
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:37,537
Now, one thing you
should know about Beth

645
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,424
is that she felt this
way in her last place.

646
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,492
Yeah, the last place...

647
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:43,994
actually, the last two places.

648
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,863
It started out little things,

649
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,316
and then it just intensifies

650
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:52,102
to the point where it gets...

651
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:53,620
like, physical.

652
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:11,155
I just wish there was
something I could do to stop it.

653
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,794
You okay, honey?

654
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,658
- Sorry.
- No.

655
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:37,873
I don't give a [bleep]
about the cameras, okay?

656
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:40,224
If you need to take
a break, you tell me.

657
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,609
I just have a hard time
talking about those places.

658
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,725
It's okay. That's why we're here.

659
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,128
In those houses, there
was lots of shadows,

660
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,647
and I would see them
reach out for the kids.

661
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,433
I just feel like I'm
going nuts or something.

662
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,952
It's crazy.

663
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,904
And had that kind of stuff

664
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,006
happened throughout your life?

665
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,174
Yeah.

666
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,276
I've had issues as
long as I can remember.

667
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:11,918
There are two main entities

668
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,721
that are in this house,

669
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,755
and they're the ones

670
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:18,758
that I'm most concerned about.

671
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:21,061
The first was the female.

672
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:24,297
She explained to me that she is Death.

673
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,768
The other interesting thing

674
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:31,171
is that she interacts
directly with the living.

675
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:35,275
She was very excited
for me to go upstairs

676
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:36,530
and see what was going on up there.

677
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,530
She was actually waiting
at the top of the staircase,

678
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:40,815
like, smiling.

679
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,901
And I think she causes

680
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,237
a lot of the living stress.

681
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:50,458
People may see her as a silhouette.

682
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,677
She wears a hat,

683
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,613
and people may see that.

684
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:55,714
But she did say,

685
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:57,566
<i>"I can project myself</i>

686
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,885
any which way I want."

687
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,921
We see shadows, and, like,

688
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,924
I've referred to them
as silhouettes before.

689
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,709
You saw a shadow in the kitchen, right?

690
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,396
Oh, yeah. Right here, as we sit.

691
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,632
It just gave me the heebie-jeebies.

692
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,867
I'm like, "Wow, that was whacked."

693
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,503
You know, Klay, I
hate to bring it up...

694
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,871
I know you're in a
bad spot right now...

695
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,573
but when you mentioned Death,

696
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:24,142
you lost how many people
in the last year or so?

697
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,663
Brother.

698
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,999
Mother.

699
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:32,117
Aunt.

700
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,618
Uncle.

701
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,419
Cousin.

702
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:36,171
Sorry.

703
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:37,222
No, don't be.

704
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,224
He's had a lot of loss

705
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,508
in a very short time.

706
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,652
Now, do you have any idea
what the woman looked like?

707
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:46,652
I had a sketch of her done.

708
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:55,962
Here, take a look at this.

709
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:03,286
Not what I'd expect her to look like,

710
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,704
but her eyes look like Death.

711
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,771
I don't like her eyes.

712
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,413
Yeah, I do. I didn't
want to bring it up.

713
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,015
When I first saw the sketch,

714
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:17,883
it did remind me of
his mom a little bit.

715
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:18,968
Wow.

716
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:25,541
This is a picture of his mom.

717
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,164
Wow. Ohh.

718
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:48,447
I do not think that it was
done in a malicious manner.

719
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:53,052
I think that this is Death
acknowledging what's happened

720
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:57,957
by taking on a familiar... guise.

721
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,259
So you didn't run into his mom.

722
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:01,427
No.

723
00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:04,897
So this is Death projecting
itself as Klay's mom.

724
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,967
Yeah.

725
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:18,044
I then encountered a male,

726
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:22,682
and this guy is no good.

727
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:29,555
He was a very bad
person when he was alive.

728
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,508
He's still a very bad person.

729
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:34,110
My opinion of this guy

730
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:35,628
is that he's an evil lunatic.

731
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:43,035
I ran into him initially in the kitchen.

732
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:44,604
He was chasing a female.

733
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,458
This carried over from
when they were alive.

734
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:52,445
She experienced her death
in the heart or chest area.

735
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:56,032
I was shown knives.

736
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,534
He was very mentally
ill when he was alive.

737
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:00,620
He's still extremely mentally ill.

738
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:03,156
The only clear thing that I got from him

739
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,575
<i>was that he hates animals</i>

740
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,728
and that women are evil creatures.

741
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:12,865
And then I did get two
numbers... five and four.

742
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,567
They were extremely
important...

743
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,402
possibly 54.

744
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:19,238
Now, a lot of things you just said

745
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,040
make me think of a
murder that took place

746
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,759
nearly 50 years ago, right
here in the neighborhood.

747
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:25,661
On April 18, 1966,

748
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,547
there was a girl
walking home from church.

749
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,884
Her name was Mary Holzem.
She was 26 years old.

750
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,020
Now, it's raining.

751
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,852
This guy Eugene Schopf
pulls up and says,

752
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:37,867
"Let me give you a ride."

753
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:41,554
I have his booking photo right here.

754
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,939
He made an advance on her.

755
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:43,773
She rejects it.

756
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,108
He flips out,

757
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,260
stabs her several times in
the chest and the stomach,

758
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,246
slits her throat from ear to ear...

759
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,448
and then winds up taking her body,

760
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,833
sticking it in the trunk,

761
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,419
and driving her to a remote
area about seven miles from here.

762
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,655
I got the death certificate here.

763
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,958
This will give you an
idea of the damages on her.

764
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:07,163
You mention you picked up
on a 5 and 4, or maybe a 54,

765
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,932
which kind of blew me away a little bit.

766
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,483
In 1954, when he was in the army,

767
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,334
he asked for psychiatric help.

768
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,818
He told them that he had
slashed the throats of animals

769
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:17,003
and that he thought

770
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,123
he wanted to do that to a woman one day.

771
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,608
Instead of serving prison time,

772
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:23,894
this sick bastard wound up
going to a mental hospital

773
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:24,811
for 10 years.

774
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:26,363
He gets released.

775
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:31,051
2002, he dies in
Alabama at the age of 65.

776
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,252
Is it possible this is your guy?

777
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:37,391
I mean, a lot of things
match, for sure, for sure.

778
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:40,894
Is it possible that he's
following Beth by any chance,

779
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,729
since she's having these
problems wherever she goes?

780
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:47,150
<i>I mean, it could be that
he's, you know, attracted here</i>

781
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:49,386
because you have abilities.

782
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:55,868
If he was alive today, I'd kick
him right in his friggin' [bleep]

783
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:00,009
How is this [bleep] affecting
everybody in the house?

784
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:03,327
I do think that he can
physically attack the living.

785
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,229
I think that people could see him.

786
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:06,730
He's just pure evil,

787
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:09,200
and he just wants to torment people.

788
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:10,901
My oldest daughter, Jeanette,

789
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:13,487
she'll wake up with brand-new bruises.

790
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,406
She woke up one morning with...

791
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:18,809
it looked almost like a burn

792
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:21,345
above her eye.

793
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,747
So, I had a sketch done

794
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,082
of what I saw

795
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:27,201
a living female experiencing.

796
00:37:40,182 --> 00:37:41,665
What a piece of [bleep]

797
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,789
Mother Mary of God.

798
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,842
Here, baby, I can brighten it up.

799
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,545
That's crazy.

800
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:05,489
Well, it ain't funny.

801
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:37,721
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

802
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:39,921
Mnh-mnh.

803
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:46,154
Amy, what do you think
may be going on here?

804
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,909
What I understand is going on

805
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,046
is that this crazy, evil man

806
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,549
is focused on your daughter.

807
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,838
<i>He is trying to influence her, as well,</i>

808
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,005
her thoughts,

809
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,957
and influencing her

810
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,810
to do possibly bad things to herself.

811
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,947
I'm concerned because...

812
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:13,182
<i>Death is there</i>

813
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:17,386
and is watching and waiting.

814
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,324
<i>I mean, I think that his intentions</i>

815
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,544
are the same intentions
he had when he was alive.

816
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,062
Do bodily harm.

817
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,196
Yes.

818
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,865
He likes to torture, you know?

819
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,370
And obviously, he likes to kill people.

820
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:41,009
Well, Beth, Klay, at least now we know

821
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,495
what's causing all the
problems in your family.

822
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,514
And I know you two guys are fighters,

823
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:49,212
but we need to find out

824
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,611
how to kick this
[bleep] out of the house

825
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:53,347
so you can live here
with your kids peacefully,

826
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,498
the way you guys deserve.

827
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:57,174
I'll turn it over to Amy,

828
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,241
and she'll have an idea of
what we can do about this.

829
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:01,410
What I would like

830
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:08,467
is to get a really big,
bad, scary male medium

831
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:10,052
to come in

832
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:14,256
and basically kick his ass out

833
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,475
and to then set up

834
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,829
a very firm barrier around your property

835
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:23,081
to keep the dead out of here.

836
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,584
Let's just block those suckers out.

837
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:28,070
So, I think I already know
the answer to this question,

838
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:31,323
but why such a big, burly, tough medium?

839
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:35,093
This crazy lunatic tries
to prey on the weak,

840
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,896
and he is an abuser,

841
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:41,944
and I think that he's
quite afraid of men.

842
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:45,317
It'll be very intimidating
and frightening for him.

843
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:46,315
Good.

844
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:47,734
So, now, what happens with Death?

845
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,685
My perception is that,

846
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:52,405
once that guy's out of here...

847
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:55,925
Death probably won't
be hanging around anymore.

848
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,862
That's the first time
I've seen you two smile

849
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:01,330
the entire night.

850
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:02,582
Hmm.

851
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,866
I mean, this is good news, I think.

852
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:06,002
I'm hoping.

853
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:07,103
How you feeling, Beth?

854
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:09,288
Still a little in shock,

855
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:11,374
but what Amy found...

856
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:12,842
hopeful that,

857
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:16,412
by doing what she's suggesting,

858
00:41:16,514 --> 00:41:17,513
that things will get better.

859
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:21,684
You guys got a lot of
love going on here...

860
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:22,885
so that helps.

861
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,354
Thank you guys very much.

862
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:27,379
So much.
