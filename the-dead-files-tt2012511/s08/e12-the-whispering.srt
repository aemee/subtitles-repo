1
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:13,487
There's all kinds of
[bleep] going on out here.

2
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,788
I'm terrified to be in my own home.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,225
There is a man with a
double-barreled shotgun,

4
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:21,593
lots of violence.

5
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:23,227
Why were you
willing to talk to me?

6
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,663
You were a suspect.

7
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:27,198
I think she was murdered.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,800
This property was soaked with blood.

9
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,270
I just hear death.

10
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:36,071
Yeah. We're not supposed to be here.

11
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:38,406
There's a dark presence.

12
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,314
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,745
These things, they're freaking out.

14
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:43,913
They're from hell.

15
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:44,915
I see dead people.

16
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,315
They were being hunted.

17
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:47,916
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:51,017
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

19
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,220
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,754
Her neck got broken.

21
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:56,790
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,757
I hear a gunshot.

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,792
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,294
I'm Steve di Schiavi.

25
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:03,544
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,044
Something's not right here.

27
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,413
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

28
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,979
- It's not safe here.
- It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,481
Are any of them buried on the property?

30
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,817
They're all buried here.

31
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,319
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,484
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:20,153
- Until the very end...
- I can't do it no more.

34
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,555
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,956
Holy [bleep]. Look at this.

36
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,525
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,058
It does not have a happy ending.

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,229
Something kills people here.

39
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,608
I'm out here in the small
town of Concrete, Washington.

40
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,110
It's about 2 hours north of Seattle.

41
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:51,045
I got a call from a lady
who sounded hysterical.

42
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:53,647
She was crying on the phone,
saying whatever's in the house

43
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:56,717
is destroying her health,
ruining her marriage

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,685
and making her feel like
she's losing her mind.

45
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,889
She doesn't know where to turn,
and we're her very last hope.

46
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,328
Before Amy arrives, I clear the area

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,163
of anything that could
influence her findings.

48
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:14,698
This home is filled with family photos,

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,934
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

50
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,104
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:34,214
There's definitely
something strange

52
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:37,683
down the street.

53
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,319
What the [bleep]?

54
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:44,622
There's, like, a, um,
energy field or something.

55
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,825
I think somebody put this
up, put this barrier up.

56
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:51,395
I don't know how [bleep]
big this thing is.

57
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,863
You know, there was,
like, a lot of violence,

58
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:59,233
lots of violence, lots of violence.

59
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:02,071
There's all kinds of
[bleep] going on out here.

60
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,243
Now, Melissa, when
we spoke on the phone,

61
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:13,546
you were almost in hysterics.

62
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,047
I'm terrified to be in my own home.

63
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,817
It's like living in a nightmare.

64
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,220
Do me a favor and just
start from the beginning.

65
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:26,456
- When'd you get here?
- Um, we came in 2006.

66
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,226
My husband was transferred
up here with the military.

67
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:31,259
- Okay.
- We found the land,

68
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,529
and we had the home built.

69
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,630
- All right. So the house is new.
- Yes.

70
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,198
Okay. Do you know anything
about the history of the land

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,632
that the house sits on?

72
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,634
I know there was a woman next door.

73
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:45,039
I know she had her throat slit.

74
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,512
Wow. So I'll look into that.

75
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,347
That's pretty interesting.
This is a big house.

76
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,680
Who exactly lives here with you?

77
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:53,250
This is a picture of, uh, my family.

78
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:56,452
This is my husband,
Brandon, and my son, Taylor.

79
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:57,887
He's 20.

80
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,987
Up until about 2 months
ago, he lived here.

81
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,200
So what exactly is
happening? What's going on?

82
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,571
Sounds, uh, banging,

83
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:13,874
shadow figures,
apparitions, being touched.

84
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,677
It's getting worse and worse and worse.

85
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,581
Did you hear that?

86
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,150
No.

87
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,783
It went right by my ear,

88
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:30,554
like "Shh," telling me to be quiet.

89
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,888
Well, you're not gonna be quiet.

90
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,658
So whatever's here can go to hell.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,259
All right? All right?

92
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:39,561
I'm here with you now.
Nothing's gonna happen.

93
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,015
Take a deep breath
'cause you're shaking.

94
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:46,063
Come on, with me. Ready?

95
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,597
- Okay.
- I trust you.

96
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,066
Okay. Good.

97
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:54,203
Nothing in this house is gonna
stop me from doing my job.

98
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:56,003
See? You feel like you're going crazy

99
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,472
'cause other people don't hear it.

100
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,972
And then, they go,
"Oh, she's just nuts."

101
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,441
I'm not saying that, am I?

102
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:03,743
- Okay?
- Okay.

103
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,143
Hmm?

104
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:08,347
All right.

105
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,049
There's, like, a
lot of people talking.

106
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,650
I heard voices in the dark.

107
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,686
And they're yelling and
screaming about this wave

108
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,919
of illness.

109
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,720
There are so many people.

110
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:18,955
I don't know who these damn people

111
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:20,623
are in the [bleep] darkness.

112
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:25,561
They seem to be in this
area of containment.

113
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:28,095
I'm wondering if they
hear people around.

114
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:30,364
You know, if they hear
people around their house,

115
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,801
they've gotta be hearing people talking.

116
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,835
They've gotta be hearing conversations.

117
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,479
It's pretty [bleep] bad.

118
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,644
Too much going on.

119
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,914
You said that you
think whatever's going on here

120
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,082
is affecting the marriage.

121
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,484
We used to be really strong.

122
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:50,890
It seems whatever force is
here is trying to divide us.

123
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:56,426
My health, um, is rapidly declining.

124
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,895
I have bad osteoporosis.

125
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:01,830
I see a specialist for my throat.

126
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:05,200
They say I have vocal cord dysfunction.

127
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:08,704
But actually, I feel like I've
been choked by what's ever here.

128
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:11,839
Did you have any of these
symptoms prior to moving here?

129
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,442
No.

130
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,943
I was healthy.

131
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:20,346
I think it's trying to kill me.

132
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:23,049
Okay.

133
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,452
These dead people in
the dark, they're so sick.

134
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:34,324
The living are feeling some
of these physical symptoms.

135
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:41,004
Oh, I don't feel good.

136
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:45,332
Really bad, really bad.

137
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,534
This is fear.

138
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:47,902
This is fear, like,

139
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,637
uh, you're so afraid. You're so afraid.

140
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,005
You're so afraid that you,
like, you know, you get sick.

141
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:53,504
You're [bleep] sick.

142
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:57,843
Terrified. [Bleep] terrified.

143
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,645
Terrified.

144
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,417
Okay. What's going on?

145
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,085
Hearing voices, multiple.

146
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,453
Is it male, female?

147
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,857
Two females arguing, really mad.

148
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:17,092
What about the TV being
on? Anything like that?

149
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:18,360
No. Everything was shut off.

150
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,460
All right. So you're hearing voices.

151
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,927
What else is going on?

152
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:24,585
Had a woman sit on the
bed and try to touch me.

153
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,810
Okay. Can you describe her for me?

154
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:33,347
She had long hair. It
was like a skeleton face.

155
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,983
Okay. So this is something
that was meant to scare you.

156
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:39,385
Yeah. She sat down on the bed,

157
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:42,955
and she reached out for me.

158
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,991
She said, "You're gonna die."

159
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:48,127
Relax. Just hold my hand. Relax.

160
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:53,529
I'm hearing a woman outside.

161
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:54,920
I think she was murdered.

162
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:01,402
There's a man, uh, with a, uh,

163
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:03,537
double-barrel shotgun.

164
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,907
And then, there's these two guys.

165
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,030
They're like... They're bullies.

166
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:13,581
And they don't wanna talk
about the... the lady at all.

167
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,652
I don't know what's going on here.

168
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:31,293
This dead woman, who crawls all around,

169
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:35,629
I see her crawling into bed.

170
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:39,787
She does, uh, wrap herself around,

171
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:43,704
uh, this living, uh, woman, I believe.

172
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,071
And it's not good for a living person.

173
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:46,628
Why?

174
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:51,087
The living person is taking
on that dead person's energy.

175
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:54,187
So they can start acting
like the dead person.

176
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,856
They'll take on
mannerisms, speech patterns.

177
00:08:56,858 --> 00:09:01,107
And then, that makes the
living person [bleep] sick.

178
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:02,560
Has anything else happened?

179
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:06,248
I was taking a bath 2 nights ago.

180
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,900
Got out of the bathtub,
felt burning on my leg.

181
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,769
- Okay.
- I looked down.

182
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:14,019
And I had scratches.

183
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,616
They were deep.

184
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,150
It hurt.

185
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:19,784
Wow.

186
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,187
I gotta say, this is probably

187
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,188
one of the more severe
cases we've worked on.

188
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,592
Just make it go away and
make it stop hurting me.

189
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:28,927
I will. We're gonna take care of it.

190
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,363
- Okay.
- It's okay.

191
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,733
I know.

192
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,203
The two bullies,

193
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,938
I think that they are around

194
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,277
when the chick strays.

195
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:55,515
They have to get her back
because she belongs to them.

196
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:58,049
But the living go through something

197
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,184
when they [bleep] retrieve her.

198
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:01,886
What happens to them?

199
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:04,722
I think the living person
would feel potentially like,

200
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:08,892
you know, they're being
grabbed or touched.

201
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:11,528
They feel the anger.
They feel the pressure.

202
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,498
They feel like all of this
is happening around them.

203
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,116
Okay. So I
understand you're a vet.

204
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,819
I am. I spent, uh, all of 2004

205
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,420
in Fallujah, Iraq, with the Marines.

206
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:45,454
I was talking to your wife.

207
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,589
And, uh, she got real upset.

208
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,823
She thinks that whatever's
here is trying to kill her.

209
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,528
I can't say it's not.

210
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,295
'Kay. So what about yourself?

211
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,430
- Any experiences in the house?
- Yeah.

212
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:57,623
Okay. So tell me about them.

213
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,722
I would get this neck pain.

214
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,389
It felt like someone had me,

215
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,591
but with a rope around my neck,
was pulling me up in the air.

216
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,759
I couldn't breathe, and I
could start tasting blood,

217
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,260
undeniable taste of blood.

218
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,563
And I've tasted blood in my
mouth a lot over my lifetime.

219
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,197
How long did it last?

220
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,698
That experience can last
anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

221
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,002
It's happened multiple
times, Steve, multiple times.

222
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,270
Yeah.

223
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,838
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,006
Uh, I was sitting there, watching TV,

225
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:25,608
and felt something weird.

226
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,276
Just looked up and
looked out the window.

227
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,946
And when I looked out the window,

228
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:31,615
at that second pane up on
that window right there,

229
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,982
was a child's face looking in at me.

230
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,483
Now, when you saw the face,

231
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,717
did you think it mighta been
some kid in the neighborhood

232
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,086
and go out and check.

233
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,487
Um, we don't have any neighborhood kids.

234
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,454
You think you're losing your mind.

235
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,553
You do. You think you're
absolutely going crazy.

236
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:43,721
Okay. I'm afraid to even ask

237
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,322
what other experiences you've had.

238
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:47,692
- But, uh...
- My wife and son had gone out,

239
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:48,924
and I was sitting here on the couch.

240
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:50,460
And everything was fine.

241
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:56,932
When I looked up, there
was a black...

242
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,900
There was a black shadow
thing standing right here

243
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,602
in front of the TV, clear as
you are right now in front of me.

244
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:04,538
I looked right at this thing,
and I couldn't see through it.

245
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,740
And it scared me so
bad that I... I gasped,

246
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,207
and I leaned back in the chair,

247
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,408
and I looked down.

248
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,552
When I looked back up, it was gone.

249
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:15,245
You all right?

250
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,980
Sounds crazy, dunnit?

251
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:18,615
Your job to protect... How
do you protect something

252
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,721
you can't protect against?

253
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:28,607
I'm seeing this other guy.

254
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,775
He's a weirdo.

255
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,444
And when I first saw him,

256
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:37,115
he looked like a shadow crawling
up the wall, onto the ceiling.

257
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:40,117
And then he shows me his face.

258
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,885
He just says he's the manager.

259
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,521
I oversee the operations.

260
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,256
He likes the ceilings.

261
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,424
He's all about the ceilings.

262
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,592
They could see him as,

263
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:55,061
like, a translucent male
or if they see, like,

264
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:59,341
just a little shadow that
moves on the ceilings.

265
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,767
He likes to feel like
he's on top of people.

266
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,603
He's always watching everybody.

267
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,306
He's gotta know everything
at all [bleep] times.

268
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,577
So, Tamee, I understand that
you used to live next door here.

269
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,045
- Yes.
- All right.

270
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,281
Lived 140 yards from here.

271
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,250
Okay. When did you move?

272
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,651
- Two years ago.
- Okay. Why?

273
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:26,722
I had a lot of experiences in the house

274
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,790
- that I couldn't explain.
- Okay.

275
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,558
Can you tell me some
experiences you had?

276
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,425
Um, one of the things that,

277
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:37,429
um, really made me
fearful for my life, um,

278
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:39,130
and my children...

279
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,733
I would get so sick.

280
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,578
So what kind of illnesses
are we talking about?

281
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:48,445
I would get horrendous
stomach pains often.

282
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,114
- Okay.
- I couldn't stop throwing up.

283
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,450
I hardly could breathe.

284
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,917
And since I've moved,

285
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,155
I have not had any stomach problems.

286
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:00,089
Listened to Melissa today

287
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,725
and what she had to say
about her health issues.

288
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:04,426
A lot of it sounds similar
to some of the stuff

289
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,860
she's going through.

290
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,897
Everybody's health is failing
around here, everybody.

291
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,198
Interesting.

292
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,767
Did anything else happen?

293
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,636
It seemed our moods and
attitudes were affected.

294
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,771
We were very, very angry.

295
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,974
And we're not angry people.

296
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,742
Did you ever bring any,
uh, priest or preachers

297
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,911
into the house to bless
it or anything like that?

298
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:28,612
I did talk to the local tribes.

299
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,832
I was told that this used
to be Native American land

300
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,804
before white people settled here,

301
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:37,787
that it was soaked with blood and people

302
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,746
shouldn't live on this property.

303
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,743
Well, I don't like it out here.

304
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:49,944
Hm-mm.

305
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:53,206
I just hear death.

306
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:56,283
I think that,

307
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,987
if you come here, you're tainted.

308
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,890
How would being here affect the living?

309
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:08,798
It would seem like it could
potentially drive people insane.

310
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:16,101
I don't think it's a good
place for anything alive.

311
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,169
And I'm kind of freaked out.

312
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:23,140
What I'm getting is that, if
you enter this space, you're...

313
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:26,042
you're kind of, like, doomed.

314
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,953
Melissa mentioned someone got murdered

315
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,300
on the original property line.

316
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,057
So I made some calls,
and the story checks out.

317
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,526
Only thing is, the cops won't
talk to me about it 'cause

318
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:49,993
it's still an open case.

319
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,828
So I'm heading over to
meet with a local historian

320
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,262
who's looking through the original case

321
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,899
files for me to tell me
exactly what happened.

322
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,574
What do we know about the victim?

323
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:06,541
- The victim was Vicki Silves.
- Okay.

324
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:09,375
Vicki was an accountant
at a local company.

325
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:10,977
She was actually married to a gentleman

326
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:12,278
by the name of John Silves.

327
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,749
And here's actually a couple
of their wedding photos.

328
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,417
Do we have any idea
when they got married?

329
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,518
1993.

330
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,393
They moved to Concrete in 1996.

331
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,428
And shortly after
coming to Concrete, uh,

332
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,396
their marriage starts to fall apart.

333
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:31,464
And then, John ended
up moving back to, uh,

334
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,733
Port Angeles, where
he worked as a trucker.

335
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,512
How's the murder take
place? What happened?

336
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:39,013
The morning of December 8, 1997,

337
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,383
she had been known to
be very prompt to work,

338
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,549
and she didn't show up.

339
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:48,153
So the manager for the
company became very concerned

340
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:52,124
and sent a, uh, coworker
over to check on her,

341
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:55,793
where he found her dead in
her gravel driveway and...

342
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:57,895
and then covered her with a blanket.

343
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,196
- Uh, the first attempt...
- Whoa, whoa.

344
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:02,166
The coworker covered her with a blanket?

345
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:03,398
- Correct.
- All right.

346
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,133
So he contaminated the
crime scene right away.

347
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:07,168
He did.

348
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,104
I have her, uh, death certificate here

349
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:13,841
that describes her cause of
death of acute exsanguination.

350
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,008
So she's stabbed in the
neck. She bleeds out.

351
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,811
Yes. I was able to
get the first 40 pages

352
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:22,748
of the police report on the murder.

353
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:26,578
What it described was, there
was no sign of forcible entry.

354
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,912
The door was opened about 6 to 8 inches.

355
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,914
- All right.
- All the lights were on.

356
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,281
The interesting thing was
that she was laying there

357
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,853
with a large pool of blood,
but her shoes were 20 feet away.

358
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,986
All right. So, Eric,
there's a lot of stuff here.

359
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:41,889
But do you know when the
last time she was seen alive?

360
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:44,959
Yes. Vicki was seen alive at a party.

361
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:48,662
There were 4 people that were
at that party besides Vicki.

362
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:51,898
Uh, two actually would
become important to this case.

363
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,768
We have Ray Valeton and a Richard Brink.

364
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,537
Vicki had gotten fairly drunk,

365
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,638
and Mr. Brink says that
he would take her home.

366
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,274
According to him, when they get there,

367
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,042
they did a little more drinking.

368
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,346
And according to him,
they'd be kissing one minute,

369
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,847
and then she'd be
cursing at him the next.

370
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,218
He apparently got uncomfortable
with this and left the house

371
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,820
about 1:15 in the morning.

372
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:21,322
He's putting himself at the crime scene.

373
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:22,789
So what happens next?

374
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,084
So the other guy in
the party, Ray Valeton,

375
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,651
he is the alibi for... for Mr. Brink.

376
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:30,019
He says he just happens to know

377
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,788
that Mr. Brink came home
at 1:30 in the morning.

378
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,088
All right. That's not much of an alibi.

379
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,692
I would have to say
that you're not mistaken.

380
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,593
Okay. Now, what about the ex-husband?

381
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,060
So the ex-husband,

382
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,387
John, uh, actually did
have a really good alibi.

383
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,656
He had been in Port
Angeles when this happened.

384
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,425
Plus, he took a
polygraph test and passed.

385
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,226
Okay. So was anybody arrested

386
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,528
and brought to the
grand jury on this case?

387
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,664
Nobody was ever
arrested for this murder.

388
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,098
Wow. And this is still
an open case today?

389
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,400
It's an unsolved case today, still open.

390
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:03,734
As far as I know, there
is nobody working the case.

391
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,170
That's a shame.

392
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:12,043
Try to get more on the bed lady.

393
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:15,712
She's so [bleep] confused

394
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:17,648
about how she died.

395
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,349
Do you have any idea when this was?

396
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,450
It doesn't feel like that long ago.

397
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,486
Even the guys, like,
they don't feel that old.

398
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,654
And she died horribly.

399
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:31,226
The assault is outside, raining, dark.

400
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:32,694
She was [bleep] blindsided.

401
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,428
Up until, really, the end,

402
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,662
she was just like, "What the?"

403
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,397
There's pain, mm,

404
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:42,435
to the left eye, uh, very sharp...

405
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:47,142
and then to the head and neck area.

406
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,212
I can't breathe. What's happening?

407
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:52,316
Like, it's like she's
not registering anything.

408
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,119
So I actually managed to track down

409
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,989
the victim's estranged husband.

410
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,623
And I've gotta be honest,
I was surprised that he

411
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,242
was not only willing but excited
to talk to me about the case.

412
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,756
So I'm meeting him
back at the crime scene,

413
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:10,024
where he wants to tell me what
he thinks happened the night

414
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,526
his wife was murdered.

415
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,397
So, John, thanks for taking
the time to meet with me.

416
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:20,599
I know this is a pretty touchy subject.

417
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:23,567
Your wife was murdered right here,

418
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,137
- in this building back here.
- Yes.

419
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:27,804
Why were you willing to talk to me?

420
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,104
You were a suspect.

421
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:31,373
This is 18 years ago.

422
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,342
And this is a cold
case. And nobody's on it.

423
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:34,677
Nobody's doing anything about it.

424
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,411
And maybe somebody knows something.

425
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,947
So let's get on it. Let's
keep this case going.

426
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,547
Okay. Now, what kind of woman was she?

427
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:42,083
She was really outgoing.

428
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:44,051
But Vicki had a jealousy issue.

429
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:47,554
She accused me of
stuff that I never did.

430
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,788
I said, "That's it."
I said, "Baby," I says,

431
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,391
"I'm outta here." I says, "I'm gone."

432
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,125
Okay. She gets murdered.

433
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,694
How do you get notified?

434
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,062
I was in bed.

435
00:20:57,064 --> 00:21:00,564
And, um, there was people
beating on the side of my house.

436
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,217
And I got up, went to
the door and opened it,

437
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,851
and here's a guy standing there with

438
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:08,053
a Skagit County Sheriff's
Department jacket on.

439
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,654
Before the night was over,

440
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:14,359
he had told me how much easier
it would be if I just confessed.

441
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:18,428
I said, "Confess to something I
never had anything to do with?"

442
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,463
So, John, exactly what was your alibi?

443
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:25,334
They found a receipt showing
that I was 150 miles away

444
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,669
the night of the murder.

445
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:27,968
Okay.

446
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,904
So, John, you mentioned on
the phone that you had a theory

447
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,039
about what might have
happened to your wife.

448
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,774
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Kay. What was it?

449
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:37,177
Well, I got this letter.
It was an anonymous letter.

450
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:41,780
The person who wrote it kind of
explains what... what happened.

451
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,782
- Vicki was an accountant.
- Okay.

452
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:47,284
And she evidently uncovered
a stealing operation

453
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:48,585
that had been going on for years.

454
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,554
And it involved a lot of money.

455
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,088
I believe she told the wrong person,

456
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,555
- and they took her out.
- All right.

457
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,158
This is pretty far-fetched stuff here.

458
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,259
But you think this mighta had
something to do with her murder?

459
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,128
I think so, yeah.

460
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:07,668
The two guys are all
in black, all in shadow.

461
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,403
The other guy, like, with
the shotgun, you know,

462
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,670
he's got, like, some hat on.

463
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:15,074
He's got, like, a long jacket on.

464
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:19,243
You know, he strikes me
as the type of guy who,

465
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:24,081
in life, obviously
held a power position,

466
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,016
somewhere like a con artist.

467
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,383
Do you know if these two guys

468
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:30,286
had anything to do
with killing the girl?

469
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:34,455
I am going to say she
knew these men, uh,

470
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,859
and was possibly friends with them.

471
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,058
So they have some sort of
relationship with the guy

472
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,626
that actually killed her?

473
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:42,132
Yes.

474
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,262
This poor chick,

475
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:47,833
whatever happened was
completely unexpected.

476
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,540
If you need us to investigate

477
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,407
unexplained activity in your home,

478
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,075
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

479
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:01,544
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files" to submit your story,

480
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,014
and we'll help if we can.

481
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:13,586
So far, I've got
a couple living in fear

482
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:16,156
on a property connected
to an unsolved murder.

483
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:17,590
But I need to see if there's

484
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:20,159
anything else that could
help my investigation.

485
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,726
Searching through old records,

486
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:25,197
I find dozens of people
who died of illnesses

487
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,165
on my clients' land.

488
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,300
But what really catches
my attention is the murder

489
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:30,668
of a Native American

490
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,818
less than 300 feet
from Melissa's property.

491
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,272
I called my old friend,
author Jeff Davis,

492
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:37,606
to look into it for me.

493
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:40,143
He says this murder was pretty brutal,

494
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:42,545
and it remains unsolved to this day.

495
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,049
So, Jeff, before we get to the murder,

496
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,618
who were the Native Americans
that inhabited this area?

497
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,319
Those people were the
Upper Skagit Indian tribe.

498
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,355
And I've got a photo of some.

499
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:59,692
Now, this was taken, uh,
probably in the early 1900s.

500
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,259
So obviously, the Native Americans

501
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,094
were displaced by the white
settlers at some point.

502
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,429
How did they do that?

503
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,297
There were a whole series of battles

504
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,699
throughout the Northwest from 1855.

505
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,200
All the way up to the 1900s,

506
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,968
- there were still tensions.
- Okay.

507
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,154
So at some point, obviously,
they were wiped out.

508
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,441
Exactly.

509
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,989
There is Native Americans here.

510
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,824
Boy, they don't wanna have anything

511
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,493
to do with this place.

512
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:33,399
Like, they're... It's, like,
repulsed, repulsed, very angry.

513
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:35,401
Anger is a understatement.

514
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,678
There's a lot of them.

515
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:42,174
But I think Native Americans
here put this barrier up.

516
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:46,712
What I'm getting from them is
that this is contaminated land,

517
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:52,117
and that no living
organism should exist here.

518
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:55,881
All right.

519
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:58,574
So tensions were high up into
the beginning of the 1900s.

520
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:01,374
Now, I know the homicide
happened in 1905.

521
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,041
Now, what do you know
about the homicide itself?

522
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,311
One of the Native Americans...
his name was Wapato Joe...

523
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:08,046
- went missing.
- Okay.

524
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,415
At this time, he was about 75 years old.

525
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,281
And he seemed to be liked by everybody.

526
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,150
About 2 weeks passed,

527
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:16,752
and then they finally
found his body, uh,

528
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:18,598
on the bank of the river.

529
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,189
How far from my
clients' property was it?

530
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:22,891
Uh, it was about 300
feet from the property.

531
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:24,794
How was he murdered? 'Cause
the article's kind of vague.

532
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:27,062
He had been shot through the throat.

533
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:28,595
It was at close range

534
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:30,230
because there were powder burns...

535
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:31,231
- Okay.
- Around that.

536
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,966
And the... the weirdest thing

537
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:35,236
was that somebody had cut off his hands.

538
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:37,102
That's a real cold-blooded
killing for a...

539
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:41,039
to a 75-year-old guy that...
You know, not bothering anybody.

540
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,740
Did they ever make an
arrest on this case?

541
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,441
No. No, nobody was ever arrested.

542
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,111
And from what I can tell,

543
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:49,614
they didn't seem to look very
hard for... for the killer.

544
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:56,419
This barrier, it promotes
violence and violent acts.

545
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:01,989
It seems to trap, uh, people
who died on this land here.

546
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:05,359
And I don't know if it
pulls people back here

547
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:07,192
who have died elsewhere.

548
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:08,629
The Native Americans,

549
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:10,763
they would throw crazy people in there.

550
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,638
And then they, like, go mad.

551
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,406
And they're, like, screaming
and yelling and hollering.

552
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:21,677
And they're, like,
jumping around all crazy.

553
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,506
And they're just acting like animals.

554
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,318
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

555
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,188
but the murdered woman
stood out the most.

556
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,590
She was probably about my height.

557
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:42,727
- She had very thin brows.
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:44,828
It was raining or had
been raining 'cause

559
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,765
she was completely wet.

560
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,167
Then, I described her wrapping
herself around a living woman

561
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:52,567
in the house.

562
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,604
The dead lady is really thin.

563
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:59,240
She is naked. And she's gray.

564
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,741
She's covered in mud.

565
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,520
She is kind of

566
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,022
coming up behind the living woman

567
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:11,523
and embracing her.

568
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:14,880
Is this what you saw?

569
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:17,149
Yes, that's what I saw.

570
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,514
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

571
00:27:39,516 --> 00:27:40,948
we're ready to reveal our findings

572
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,217
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

573
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:45,819
When I sat down with Melissa here,

574
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,253
the first words out of her mouth

575
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:50,357
were, "I'm terrified
to be in my own home."

576
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,724
She believes that whatever's
here is destroying her marriage,

577
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:56,394
her health, and she
thinks she's going insane.

578
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:57,762
This is her husband, Brandon.

579
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:00,098
Uh, he served with the Navy,

580
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,733
and he was with the
Marine Corps in Iraq.

581
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:04,568
He's been to hell and back, basically,

582
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,771
but never expected to come home
to a war zone in his own house.

583
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,871
They can't afford to leave,

584
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:13,308
but they're not sure
they'll survive if they stay.

585
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,043
So now that Amy knows who
you guys are, a little bit

586
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:18,125
about what's going on, she's
gonna describe her walk for us.

587
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:24,283
When I first approached the property,

588
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:29,788
I realized your house seems
to be located inside some kind

589
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,625
of energy barrier.

590
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:38,327
It seemed very negative
and very, very powerful.

591
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:42,632
There's a lot of dead
that are just on the land,

592
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:43,833
who are trapped.

593
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,668
And I was thinking that
it would be possible

594
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:51,839
that you guys would hear
them talking or hear voices.

595
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,374
I felt nauseous and this illness.

596
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,743
And the people

597
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:59,145
were saying that a lot of
them had died from this.

598
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,280
What I kept hearing out there

599
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,258
was that we were not
supposed to be here.

600
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:08,251
We've heard children.

601
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,629
Uh, I've heard a man, heard women.

602
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,079
I was sitting
on the couch, looked up,

603
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,015
and I saw what looked
like a child's face.

604
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,950
It almost looked like
a hologram projection,

605
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:20,586
a blue and white face looking
in the... in the glass.

606
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:22,854
- Okay.
- You mentioned sicknesses, right?

607
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,456
- Oh, yeah.
- One of the main reasons

608
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,426
we're here is because her
health has deteriorated.

609
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,027
A couple months ago,
I had an iron infusion.

610
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,696
My blood won't produce iron.

611
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:36,966
Vocal cord dysfunction,
now, all of a sudden, nausea,

612
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,435
vomiting.

613
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:40,602
I was pretty healthy
before we moved here.

614
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,071
Wow.

615
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,706
Now, the barrier thing, do
you know who put this thing up?

616
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,208
Native Americans put up the barrier.

617
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,745
And the reason why was, over
a very long period of time,

618
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,979
they noticed a pattern.

619
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:56,547
Some of the men from the
tribe would come out here.

620
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:00,419
And after exposure to this area,

621
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:02,170
they would basically go insane.

622
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:08,024
So they decided the best thing to do

623
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:10,893
was to block off this land

624
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:15,464
because they felt like it causes
mental illness, violent acts.

625
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:18,933
And what really freaked me
out was, any living person

626
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:21,934
who steps onto this land is tainted.

627
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:27,106
And what they were kind
of saying was, "Doomed."

628
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:29,111
Yeah, I feel like I'm going crazy.

629
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:31,344
I spoke to one of Melissa's neighbors.

630
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,112
They used to live here.
Her name was Tamee.

631
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:35,181
Her and her husband fought a lot here,

632
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,015
and she had mysterious stomach pains

633
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,450
that she couldn't figure out.

634
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,918
She moved away 2 years ago.

635
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,752
When she moved, she was fine.

636
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:45,221
Interesting. Interesting.

637
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:46,922
Now, when Tamee was living here,

638
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:51,159
she said she went to a local
Native American tribe for help.

639
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,527
And they told her, "Too
much bloodshed on the land.

640
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,029
We can't help you."

641
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,764
Really?

642
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,865
- Yeah.
- Okay.

643
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,367
Now, let me tell you
a little bit of history

644
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:02,102
about what we're sitting on.

645
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,403
This was the Upper Skagit Tribe area.

646
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,073
They were around for
about 7,000 to 8,000 years,

647
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,075
- apparently, on this land.
- Holy.

648
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,807
Yeah.

649
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,331
I got a photo of them
from the early 1900s.

650
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:16,832
Now, 1840 is when the
white settlers came in.

651
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:18,706
This is when they started
to push these guys out.

652
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:22,250
After 50 years of fighting, eventually,

653
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:24,656
the white settlers wiped
out nearly the entire tribe.

654
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,816
We really have had a run of
bad luck since we moved here.

655
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:34,153
We used to joke and say, "Did
we move on Indian burial ground?"

656
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,389
Well, it's not a burial ground.

657
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:39,259
It's kind of their dumping ground.

658
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:45,662
So what else did you see on the walk?

659
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,163
When I got here,

660
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:52,169
I encountered a deceased
woman who was murdered.

661
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:58,340
There were these two men
that were constantly with her.

662
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:02,509
And they were preventing
her from speaking to me.

663
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:06,412
They didn't want me to
find out who had killed her.

664
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,548
I felt like she knew these two men.

665
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,316
They were around at
the time of her murder,

666
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,617
but they didn't directly do it.

667
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,420
And the only thing that I
got on the man who killed her

668
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:20,592
was that he did something
about, like, stealing money.

669
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:23,193
I got that it was relatively recent.

670
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:26,429
Uh, she died a horrible, horrible death.

671
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:31,299
And I felt extremely sharp
pains in the neck and the head.

672
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:33,356
I mean, it was awful, what he did.

673
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:40,304
I'm sorry, guys. I'm having a neck pain.

674
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,906
Yeah. It's bad here.

675
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,543
This happens a lot to me.

676
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,879
It just comes on out of nowhere.

677
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:52,214
I taste blood in my mouth.
I feel like I can't breathe.

678
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:54,248
- I feel like I'm choking.
- You okay?

679
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,484
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

680
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:57,380
Mm-hmm.

681
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:59,853
So you guys mentioned there
might have been a murder.

682
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,987
Literally, you can throw a
rock at where it happened.

683
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:03,023
So I looked into it,

684
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,757
and there was a murder of a woman.

685
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,725
Her name was Vicki Silves.

686
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:09,852
She and her husband, John,
moved next door in 1996.

687
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,474
When they did move here,

688
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,441
their marriage quickly went downhill.

689
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,266
And John moved out within a few months.

690
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,780
On December 8, 1997, Vicki
failed to show up for work.

691
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,516
So her boss sent a coworker to the house

692
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,750
to see if she was around.

693
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,351
When he came here,

694
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:30,684
he found her in the driveway
in a pool of her own blood.

695
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,158
Now, you felt neck pain.

696
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,393
She'd been stabbed in
the neck multiple times.

697
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,731
I got a hold of the
death certificate here.

698
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:45,852
Now, it's still an open case.

699
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:48,069
And I was only able to get 40 pages

700
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:50,805
out of a 160-page case folder.

701
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,138
She had been at a party that night,

702
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,475
and she was invited there
by a guy named Richard Brink.

703
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:57,076
Apparently, she got drunk.

704
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,465
And this guy, Richard Brink,
walks her back to the house.

705
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,081
He admits to the cops that,

706
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,681
when he gets there,
they start making out.

707
00:34:04,683 --> 00:34:06,416
She was very flirtatious all night.

708
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:08,383
And then, she'd get violent with him.

709
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:09,790
And then, she'd be okay again.

710
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,789
Brink told the detectives that
he got fed up with her behavior,

711
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,124
and he decided to leave.

712
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:15,923
But he said, he left her, she was alive.

713
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:17,892
He was never arrested.

714
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:19,162
I tried tracking him down.

715
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:20,861
I figured, let me talk to him myself.

716
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:22,330
Uh, he's dead.

717
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:26,633
He died in 2003 at the age
of 47 of a heart attack.

718
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:28,935
But the other suspect was the husband,

719
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,903
who she was estranged from.

720
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,972
I spoke to him, and he had
a really rock-solid alibi.

721
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:36,640
He was at least 3 hours away
the night she was murdered.

722
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,577
He couldn't have been here
when the murder went down.

723
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,380
I don't understand why the cops

724
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,079
didn't take a closer look at Brink.

725
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,249
But what I found interesting
was that, about 18 months

726
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,416
after Vicki was murdered,

727
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,150
John's mother got an anonymous letter.

728
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:50,253
Basically said that she was
working at a local company,

729
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,289
and she found out that
people were stealing money.

730
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,257
And she told the wrong person.

731
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,257
And then, they had her killed.

732
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:59,061
It's still an open case.

733
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,228
This theory is interesting to me,

734
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,498
just because of all the different people

735
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,965
that this dead female

736
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,229
was showing me were
involved in her death.

737
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:11,336
I know her killer is
dead because he's here.

738
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:13,272
You think this is the same
person you came across,

739
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,238
or you think it's somebody else?

740
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,307
I had a sketch done of her.

741
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:23,845
Take a look at that.

742
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,485
Yeah. It could be her.

743
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,460
They look similar.

744
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,170
You okay?

745
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,804
What do you think
when you see that face?

746
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,273
Do you know her?

747
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:46,407
I don't know.

748
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:49,465
Have you felt her in
your room, in your bed?

749
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:52,012
I can't breathe.

750
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,217
What I was seeing, that
she'll get into the bed,

751
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,342
and she'll wrap herself around you.

752
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:06,523
And the reason why she does that

753
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,893
is because she feels
safe from the two men.

754
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:12,595
The problem is... is that
being in close proximity

755
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:14,796
consistently with a dead person

756
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,999
can not only make you extremely sick.

757
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:23,572
It can also cause you to take
on the dead's personality,

758
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:26,773
mannerisms, speech patterns.

759
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:28,307
Melissa has changed a lot.

760
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,643
I told her just the other night,

761
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,077
I said she's not the
same woman I married.

762
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,112
She's a completely different person.

763
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:35,255
Sometimes, it's like
living with a stranger.

764
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:41,818
This woman sat
on the end of the bed.

765
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,021
She had, like, a skeleton face.

766
00:36:45,023 --> 00:36:49,791
She said, "You're gonna
die," or "Do you wanna die?"

767
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,610
I couldn't... I couldn't figure it out.

768
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,442
I was too scared.

769
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,976
Okay.

770
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,613
I did have a sketch done of what I saw.

771
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,483
Oh.

772
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:14,259
Yeah. I know... I know that.

773
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:17,401
I have a... a lotta nightmares.

774
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:21,202
And I feel a lotta pressure on me.

775
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,838
It's like a snake.

776
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,807
She's been complaining
of a lot of chest pain lately.

777
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:29,075
She says it feels like a rubber
band's wrapped around her.

778
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:32,466
She's killing you.

779
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:36,347
When I sit down at the table at reveals,

780
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:40,852
I will, like, tap the
people and scan them.

781
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:43,354
What I saw around you was death.

782
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:14,845
When I sit down at the table at reveals,

783
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:19,548
I will, like, tap the
people and scan them.

784
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,784
What I saw around you was death.

785
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,765
You have a choice to make here.

786
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,936
I know the choice.

787
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,709
My god.

788
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,182
I can't breathe.

789
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,921
Sweetie, you're a fighter.

790
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:20,097
Listen, I know you two got more
than you bargained for tonight.

791
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,068
Um, the only good news is
that you know you're not crazy.

792
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,702
Uh, but to see if there's
a way out of this mess,

793
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:27,824
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

794
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:36,012
This is, like, when my job really sucks.

795
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:42,682
Sometimes, there are
those places and locations

796
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:47,288
that just never should
have been inhabited.

797
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:51,324
And this is one of those places.

798
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:57,327
So, in this situation,

799
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:01,965
for your very survival,

800
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,165
you should leave.

801
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,722
And you should leave
as soon as possible.

802
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,173
So there's no way of putting up
a barrier or anything like that?

803
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:15,508
I mean, the Native Americans
knew that this place was...

804
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,545
was not livable.

805
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:20,579
And they put their garbage here.

806
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:24,083
Okay. So, if she leaves,
death would go away.

807
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,032
If you make this choice, yes.

808
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:30,690
If, for some reason, we can't go...

809
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,329
I know.

810
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:41,463
So if she moves away from here,
could she be like her friend

811
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:43,515
Tamee, happy and healthy again?

812
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,735
Yeah.

813
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:51,141
Melissa's gotta make
the choice to be healthy.

814
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:54,150
I'd have to send her,
and I'd have to stay.

815
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,076
I can't move. I brought my mother here.

816
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:59,322
I came back from the war, and
my mom wasn't doing too well.

817
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,900
She's kind of wasting away.

818
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,945
She wouldn't be able to leave.

819
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:06,851
- You know I won't leave you.
- Thank you.

820
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:08,728
I won't leave, I'll never leave you.

821
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:11,131
Been with you 22 years, won't leave.

822
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,624
I know it's a lot, but just
promise me you'll at least

823
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:15,990
think about...

824
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:16,959
- Oh, yeah.
- The advice.

825
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:18,327
Promise you.

826
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:20,528
- Okay.
- I understand.

827
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,097
I think Melissa understands, as well,

828
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,131
the... the gravity of the situation.

829
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:28,570
We've gone through hell
since we've moved here.

830
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,338
But I was hoping there
was gonna be a way out.

831
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,673
The only way Melissa
and Brandon can be safe

832
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:39,610
is to move as far away
from this land as possible.

833
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:42,113
If they do that, they'll free themselves

834
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:43,881
of the evil surrounding them

835
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:46,283
and lead a healthy and peaceful life.
