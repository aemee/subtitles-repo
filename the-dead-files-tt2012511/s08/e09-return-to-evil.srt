1
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:13,489
It's like this family was cursed.

2
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,626
I go outside, found
him in the truck, dead.

3
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:20,963
What he gets off on is being seen.

4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:25,234
Every night, I see a shadow
coming down the hallway.

5
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,837
I do hear pounding.

6
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,107
There were some lynchings or murders.

7
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,131
What is he trying to do?

8
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:33,864
Kill them.

9
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:37,601
They want to wreak havoc and chaos.

10
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,736
There's a dark presence.

11
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:42,205
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,207
These things, they're freaking out.

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,375
They're from hell.

14
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:46,676
I see dead people.

15
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:48,011
They were being hunted.

16
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,746
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,648
They were setting people on fire,

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,749
burning them alive.

19
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,884
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:55,418
Her neck got broken.

21
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,555
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,557
I hear a gunshot.

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,782
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,415
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:05,250
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:06,451
Something's not right here.

27
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:09,788
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,889
It's not safe here.

29
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,357
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,159
Are any of them buried on the property?

31
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,427
They're all buried here.

32
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:17,262
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,298
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,766
Until the very end...

35
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,134
I can't do it no more.

36
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:24,102
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:25,904
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

38
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:27,172
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,841
It does not have a happy ending.

40
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,109
Something kills people here.

41
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,202
I'm in Patricksburg, Indiana.

42
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:49,661
It's a tiny, little town 70
miles southwest of Indianapolis.

43
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:52,967
I got a call from a woman named Sonya.

44
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,768
Now, she'd been in an
abusive relationship

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,937
and finally got the courage
to grab her two daughters

46
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,439
and get the hell out.

47
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,807
Now here's where
the problem is...

48
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,310
She moved back into the
house that she grew up in,

49
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,479
and the abuse didn't stop.

50
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:08,581
But this time, she's
being attacked by something

51
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:09,487
she can't even see.

52
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,493
Things are so bad, she's
living in an RV on the property

53
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,961
just to avoid the house.

54
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,662
This poor girl's been through a lot,

55
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,165
and I really hope Amy
and I can help her out.

56
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,604
Before Amy arrives,

57
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:29,808
I clear the house of
any leading information,

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,082
removing family photos and
covering personal items.

59
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,314
When I'm finished,

60
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,617
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

61
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,470
Oh, boy.

62
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,606
Uh, this isn't good.

63
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,209
This probably isn't a good
place to build anything.

64
00:02:56,312 --> 00:03:00,069
It's like the earth literally
sucks the structures into it.

65
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:05,152
It's almost like the earth devours them.

66
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:08,322
There's a lot of mental illness there,

67
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:13,013
and there's a lot of pain
inflicted upon others.

68
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:20,834
Well, Sonya, I'm glad I'm here

69
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,069
'cause you sounded
really bad on the phone.

70
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,449
So let me get this
straight. You're living here?

71
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:26,850
Yes.

72
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,920
I'd rather live here in
the RV in the front yard

73
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:32,022
than I would in their house, any day.

74
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,691
I'm scared of that house.

75
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,193
Now, where's your parents' house
in relation to where we are now?

76
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,228
Up the hill, basically.

77
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:40,497
Who's living where?

78
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,800
This is all of us.

79
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,568
This is my youngest daughter, Cassie.

80
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,936
She's 13.

81
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,071
This is myself.

82
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:48,639
We live here.

83
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:51,875
This is my mother,
Pam, and my father, Ted.

84
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,110
And they live in the house.

85
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:54,712
And my oldest daughter, Ashlyn,

86
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,907
refused to even be on the property.

87
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,745
What are you hoping we can do for you?

88
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,949
My parents are planning on
finding a place down in Florida,

89
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,684
and they've offered
me the house, which...

90
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,652
I would love to have Cassie there,

91
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:10,157
but I won't because I don't want
her childhood to be like mine.

92
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,825
Okay. So let me get this straight.

93
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,760
- You grew up in this house?
- Yes.

94
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,028
Was the house haunted then?

95
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,864
Yes.

96
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,632
I swore I'd never come back here.

97
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,568
But you had to come back to
escape an abusive relationship.

98
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,703
Yes.

99
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,739
It definitely took a
lot to get away from.

100
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,708
This was my only option.

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,510
So this was like a safe haven for you.

102
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:30,811
So I thought.

103
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:32,246
If you can, just give me a rundown

104
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,314
of what everybody's
experiencing in the house.

105
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,417
Voices, growling,

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,755
things moving, the
fear of being watched.

107
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,157
And there have been shadow people.

108
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,994
There's been attacks,
people being touched.

109
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,438
I can only imagine

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,407
how tough this must be
for you to talk about.

111
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,211
It's been a whirlwind of
emotions and, you know,

112
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,712
I worry about my daughters.

113
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:01,849
You know, I've lived with this
for... Well, I'm 35 years old.

114
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:05,486
And since I was young,
it's haunted me, you know.

115
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:06,587
Why? Why me?

116
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,357
Why?

117
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:15,095
I'm seeing this man, and
he's dressed in black.

118
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:18,665
He is kind of wearing a cowboy outfit.

119
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:22,236
He looks fairly young,
I would say in his 30s.

120
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,537
He's pretty tough.

121
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,373
And he's quiet, and
he's just standing there.

122
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,546
He likes to be seen.

123
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,098
He also likes this area a great deal.

124
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:45,216
He is trying to experiment
with moving things

125
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,468
and actually really hardcore
interact with the living.

126
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:51,241
So, this is your backyard?

127
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,977
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

128
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,111
Yes.

129
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,913
This is a privately owned cemetery.

130
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,748
As a child looking
out my bedroom window,

131
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,974
this is what I saw.

132
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,154
How do you feel
now, being in here?

133
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:06,357
- I'm on edge being in here.
- Okay.

134
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,558
So, what's going on?

135
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,193
Well, we have a shadow

136
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:12,730
that you actually see it every
night go down this hallway.

137
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,965
Okay. So describe what it looks like.

138
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,568
- Just a black mist, really.
- How big is it?

139
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,936
How tall is it?

140
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,974
I'd say about right
here, about five feet.

141
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,944
The guy in black...

142
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:32,349
people would see him as a
shadow person, without a doubt.

143
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,052
He looks a lot shorter
when he's in that form

144
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:38,989
than what he really is 'cause
he's probably about 5'10".

145
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,994
But in the shadow-person form,

146
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:46,431
he looks more, maybe,
about five foot and wider.

147
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,166
He wants a lot of attention.

148
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:52,036
What he gets off on is being seen.

149
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,341
Okay. So, anything else going on?

150
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,710
Uncontrollable crying.

151
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:57,411
Cannot figure out why.

152
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,680
From the time I woke up
to the time I went to bed,

153
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:01,248
if I was in this house, I was sobbing.

154
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:01,750
The whole day?

155
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,018
Oh, the whole day,
until I went to the RV.

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,753
And then, it just stopped.

157
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,321
I'm not a psychologist,

158
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:10,523
but you have bad
memories here growing up.

159
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,791
Yes.

160
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:15,328
But it's not that kind
of emotion, you know?

161
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,799
It's not the feeling of losing someone.

162
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,367
Okay. So, you've had
that kind of heartbreak?

163
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,668
Yeah.

164
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:26,372
A couple years ago, my
uncle had taken his own life.

165
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,507
His name was Jeff.

166
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,688
Actually... he's right here.

167
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,516
He had lived here for a while.

168
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,149
We were very, very close.

169
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,451
Where did this happen?
Not in this house.

170
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,053
But he did spend a lot of time here.

171
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,555
- We were real tight.
- Yeah.

172
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:42,556
How old was he when he passed?

173
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,192
He would've been 45,
I think, when he died.

174
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,094
Oh. So he was a young man.
What kind of guy was he?

175
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:48,829
He just brought a smile
to everybody's face.

176
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:49,897
If somebody was in a bad mood,

177
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,532
he'd be the one to get you out of it.

178
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:55,036
Never, ever, ever thought he
would do it, especially now,

179
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,138
after he knew what we went through

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,740
with my first husband
that took his own life,

181
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,242
as well.

182
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,910
He spent a lot of time here.

183
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:06,080
And we got married and left
and moved in with his mother.

184
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,182
And then, next thing I know,

185
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,485
I go outside and couldn't find him

186
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:14,722
and found him in the truck, dead.

187
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:18,059
That's Raymond.

188
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,627
How did he do it, if
you don't mind me asking?

189
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:20,995
He shot himself in the head also.

190
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,897
He died in '99.

191
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,902
I hold a lot of guilt for both of them.

192
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:26,884
Listen. Listen to me.

193
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,186
Listen to me good. Okay?

194
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,921
I learned one thing in life.

195
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,823
If somebody wants to do
what your husband did,

196
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:36,327
if they want to do that, nothing
you do is gonna change it.

197
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,262
These are tortured souls
you're talking about here.

198
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,365
I know. And I do know that.

199
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:45,203
I do. I just can't tell my heart that.

200
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:49,019
The cowboy guy... I do
see him with a handgun.

201
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:54,269
He was pretty intimidating
when he was alive.

202
00:08:55,624 --> 00:09:00,491
He likes this space the most.

203
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:04,178
There's a familiarity here with him.

204
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,068
I don't trust this guy,

205
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,538
and I think he's doing
very bad things in here.

206
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:17,044
So, what's going on in here?

207
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:21,202
I woke up one night to somebody
pushing at the end of the bed.

208
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,203
I looked up, and in
between the wall and the bed

209
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:27,873
was two hooded figures
that had no face, no eyes.

210
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,142
And there was one at the end of my bed

211
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,910
and one on the other side of my bed.

212
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,913
And I woke up screaming bloody murder.

213
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,449
And that was when my mom got
up out of bed, came in here.

214
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,151
And I told her what had happened.

215
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,753
And she immediately went
into my brother's room

216
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,256
and was like, "Okay, Chad.
It's time to tell her."

217
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:45,757
I'm like, "Tell me what?"

218
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,193
You know, and that's when
they began to tell me that,

219
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,662
you know, they had had
similar experiences.

220
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,164
With the same type of sighting?

221
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,332
Yes.

222
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:54,666
Anything else?

223
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:55,734
I had a dream one night.

224
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,536
It was almost like the shadow people

225
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,871
that we saw going down the hallway,

226
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,007
but it was leaning over
me, scratching my forehead.

227
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:03,275
And the next morning, I got up,

228
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:07,079
and I had a scratch on my head.

229
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,548
Now, couldn't you have
just scratched yourself?

230
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,150
I don't believe so because
of the way, you know,

231
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:13,585
when I looked in the mirror,

232
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:19,791
it was exactly how, in my dream,
the shadow would have did it.

233
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:25,297
In this room, I just see,
like, this younger girl.

234
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,833
There's something off about her.

235
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:33,138
Somebody's summoned her up from
her grave and, like, dug her up.

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,609
And, like, she didn't come back right.

237
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,878
I see her standing
at the end of the bed,

238
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,547
and she's just staring.

239
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,315
And it's really [bleep] creepy

240
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:48,320
because standing behind
her is this dark thing

241
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,290
that has attached itself to this kid.

242
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,992
The thing ultimately
controls her and has, like,

243
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,695
a connection to her.

244
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:59,278
Do you have any idea what this
thing that's controlling her is?

245
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,434
I would say it's some
kind of demonic force.

246
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,004
Can you see it? What does it look like?

247
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:08,256
This thing is very tall.

248
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:11,043
Its hands are super
weird-looking...

249
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:16,082
long, really super little
hands but long fingers.

250
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,484
And do you have any idea
what it's trying to do?

251
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:19,986
I think that it's trying

252
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,521
to attach itself to
somebody in this room.

253
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:26,425
What demons want... they
want to wreak havoc and chaos.

254
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:28,895
Would you say that this
person is in danger?

255
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,696
Yes, I would.

256
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,831
So Sonya said she had a hell
of a time growing up here.

257
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:58,667
I did not know that it marked
her for life like it has.

258
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,503
Now, Sonya's at the point where
she won't even stay in the house.

259
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:02,938
She's staying in the RV.

260
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,340
Yeah. It broke my heart.

261
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:08,610
She's got a bedroom in
there that's still her room.

262
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,078
I mean, we still call it her room.

263
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,781
It's still decorated, like, for her.

264
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,449
Have you experienced anything?

265
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:19,187
The very first night we
ever stayed in this house,

266
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,591
I woke up with a girl
standing beside my bed,

267
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,093
I mean, just, like, right here.

268
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,929
Like, she's just
looking down at my face.

269
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,564
Have you seen anything else like that?

270
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,932
Just... every night,

271
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,936
I see a shadow coming down the hallway.

272
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,570
And it looks like it
goes out the front door.

273
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,338
Your daughter explained
the same thing to me.

274
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,574
And we both have seen
it at the same time.

275
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,043
So, it's not been easy
here for you, either?

276
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,278
No.

277
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,946
It's that back hallway.

278
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:46,949
If anything in this house
spooks me, it's the back hallway.

279
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,351
And why does that spook you?

280
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,553
Well, number one, that's
where I heard the voice.

281
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,022
What voice?

282
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,456
I was in the bathroom one day,

283
00:12:54,558 --> 00:13:02,584
and just this most evil, growly
voice was like, "Stop it."

284
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,833
Just as low.

285
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:09,634
And I was petrified that day.

286
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:16,078
There's also another male here.

287
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,609
And I see, like, an older male.

288
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:21,951
He's a big problem.

289
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:25,521
He yells a lot, very threatening.

290
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:29,317
I do hear pounding on the walls,

291
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:33,692
especially in, like, in this area.

292
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:36,833
He's related to somebody
in the household.

293
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:40,970
And he's somebody's grandfather
or great-grandfather.

294
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:47,877
There's something in the
family that's really bad.

295
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,393
Two people, at some point,
in this family, got married.

296
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:54,929
They shouldn't have. It
was bad, very wrong and bad.

297
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,033
And from that point
on, it's like this...

298
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:04,639
this line, this family,
was cursed by their own.

299
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:09,577
I don't think I've
ever... seen this before.

300
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,113
I don't think he wants to show me

301
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:13,714
who he's related to

302
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:17,618
because that's the person
he's trying to destroy.

303
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,881
So, Chad, I was talking to Sonya.

304
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,198
Now, she told me about the experiences

305
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,298
and how this house really
scarred her for life.

306
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Now, she had mentioned
you'd moved out of here

307
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,735
pretty quick when you were young.

308
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,579
Oh, as soon as I was 18, I was gone.

309
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,569
Why, though?

310
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,436
Most of it was because of the
things that had happened here.

311
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:37,871
Okay. So tell me about some of them.

312
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:41,274
One particular night, when I
was probably 8 or 9 years old,

313
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:46,413
standing around my bed, I
counted six hooded figures.

314
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,981
I had three on one side of my bed,

315
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,816
three on the other side.

316
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:51,585
So, you saw the same exact thing

317
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,420
that Sonya was telling me about?

318
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:54,721
Yeah.

319
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,890
I'm 37 now, and I close my
eyes and I can still see them.

320
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,125
- Okay. Anything else?
- Yeah.

321
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,829
Around the same time that I seen that,

322
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:06,800
I was laying in bed and woke up
to feeling pressure on my chest.

323
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,235
And it felt like they
were underneath my bed

324
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:12,806
and were pulling the
sheet tight down so...

325
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,375
pinning me to my bed where
I could not move at all.

326
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,710
I went to scream out,

327
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:19,312
and I couldn't get
any words to come out.

328
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:21,147
It took all the air out of my chest.

329
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:25,218
I just told myself that I
shouldn't look underneath there.

330
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,430
I may not like what I see.

331
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:34,761
I see that the grandfather guy

332
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:38,732
is attacking somebody in this room

333
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,932
and is pushing down on their heart.

334
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:45,730
It might feel more like their
throat or chest pressure,

335
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,100
but he's actually inside their chest.

336
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:52,404
He's trying to figure out
how to make the heart stop.

337
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,507
He can't... grab it.

338
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:59,189
He can put pressure on it,
but he can't squeeze it.

339
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,082
And what is he trying to do?

340
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,683
Kill them.

341
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,877
First thing I do
when I get to a location

342
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:21,177
is pull the property deed.

343
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,045
Turns out one of the original owners

344
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,514
was on the land for 65 years.

345
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,583
I had a local historian check them out,

346
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,885
and she just called back
saying these people have a story

347
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:33,355
I'm definitely gonna want to know about.

348
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:42,544
So, Glenda, what
were you able to find out

349
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:44,724
about the original owners
of my client's property?

350
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,917
Stephen Macgerlein came
from Germany to Owen County

351
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,518
in the later 1830s.

352
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,986
He married,

353
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:54,523
and he and his wife had,
over the years, 12 children.

354
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,925
Okay.

355
00:16:56,027 --> 00:17:00,296
They bought the property in
1864 and used it as a coal mine.

356
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,565
Did he mine coal right
on my client's property?

357
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,133
That's my understanding.

358
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,434
Okay. That's interesting.

359
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,836
You mentioned on the phone

360
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,596
that this family had a story I'm
gonna want to hear for my case.

361
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,729
What was that?

362
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:13,198
Well, they had a number of deaths

363
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,168
in the course of the time that
they lived in Patricksburg.

364
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,007
In 1872, a 2-year-old son
died in an accident at the mill

365
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,042
less than a 1/2 a mile down the road.

366
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,710
- His name was Frederick.
- Okay.

367
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,447
In 1888, his
13-year-old daughter,

368
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,217
Hermione, died of typhoid fever.

369
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,019
I'm afraid to even ask what else.

370
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,188
In 1901, his
35-year-old daughter,

371
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,557
Molly, died of consumption.

372
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,093
The next year, in 1902,

373
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:47,165
his wife died at the
age of 61 of peritonitis,

374
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,101
intestinal problems, also.

375
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,437
- Pretty tragic.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,003
So, what happened to him, Stephen?

377
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:58,342
He died in 1915 at home of dropsy.

378
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,211
- That's a heart condition.
- Okay.

379
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,481
I brought you an obituary I
thought you'd like to see...

380
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,177
"The Death of a Prominent Man."

381
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,652
So he's 81 when he dies.

382
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,187
- Mm-hmm.
- He died on the property.

383
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,089
Yes. And, Glenda, let
me ask you a question.

384
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,667
There's a couple cemeteries literally
right next door to the property.

385
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,389
- Right.
- Is he buried there?

386
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,289
- Yes.
- Okay.

387
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:20,192
The whole family is
buried in that cemetery.

388
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:26,932
Hmm.

389
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,819
There's something about
two children that died.

390
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:35,287
There's two children graves.

391
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:39,850
I think one of them belongs to
the girl I saw in the bedroom.

392
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,316
How old?

393
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,020
Like 11 to 14 years of age, maybe.

394
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,189
I'm not sure about the other one.

395
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,859
I think it was a littler kid...

396
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,830
which I think is a boy.

397
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:58,267
The girl... I see
her with blond hair.

398
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,375
And I feel like she was sick,
that she died from an illness.

399
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,309
More than likely, she
died here, on this land,

400
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,246
and that's what makes her close by.

401
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:14,317
There's something weird
with her... her soul.

402
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,990
And that's why she's out of her grave.

403
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:18,926
Very strange.

404
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:22,158
When Glenda
mentioned the Macgerleins

405
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,547
operated a coal mine on the property,

406
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,013
my ears perked up.

407
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:28,240
Every time I've looked into one,
I found some terrible accident.

408
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:31,303
I'm on my way back to the house
to meet a coal-mining expert

409
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,553
who says two people

410
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,822
died horrible deaths
right on Pam's property.

411
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,713
I understand that there
was coal mining done

412
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,981
right here on this property.

413
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,983
That's correct. That was very common.

414
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,484
People would have small mines

415
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,987
that they would operate
on their own property.

416
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,623
Do you have any idea where
they would have did the mining

417
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,124
- on the property here?
- Right here.

418
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,966
They opened this up,
dug down to the coal.

419
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,466
And they just left it open,
and it filled up with rainwater.

420
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,868
Oh. See, I...
Just looking at it,

421
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,236
I would have never
known this was a mine.

422
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:05,439
It totally changed the landscape
of this part of the country.

423
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,908
I know it was a dangerous job.

424
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,109
It was very hazardous,

425
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,111
particularly the underground mines.

426
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:14,181
We have a picture right here. Wow.

427
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,283
These look like terrible
working conditions.

428
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,152
There were numerous people killed

429
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:20,387
and seriously injured
literally every day.

430
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,390
You mentioned two people died on
the property here in the mines.

431
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,360
What happened with that? The
first one happened in 1894.

432
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,462
The victim's name was Aaron Wark,

433
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,731
and he was taking a
break in the coal mine,

434
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,167
and the roof caved in on him.

435
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,936
He lingered for two
days from his injuries

436
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,504
and then finally passed away.

437
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:38,906
He was 32 years old,

438
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,241
and he left a wife and
three small children.

439
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,964
Okay. So, what was the second death?

440
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,498
Ralph Wright.

441
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,234
He was killed in 1934.

442
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,769
He just got careless.

443
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:52,839
He was pushing a cart
along and made a mistake

444
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:56,944
and fell 90 feet down an open shaft,

445
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:00,480
broke his neck, fractured
his skull, very tragic.

446
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,349
I know what that looks
like. I've seen it.

447
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:03,617
It's not a pretty sight.

448
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:09,972
It's quite a big circle of land

449
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:13,840
that surrounds this particular location,

450
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:17,444
and it has something to do
with what's going on here.

451
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:24,462
And it did seem like the
earth was bad for a long time,

452
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:26,529
like things couldn't grow.

453
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:30,511
It's like the earth literally
sucks the structures into it

454
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:32,868
and somehow destroys them.

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,207
And I really think that
there's this subtle poisoning

456
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:39,975
going on.

457
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:41,644
Nothing should be built here

458
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:45,609
because they do eventually take it down.

459
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,922
If you need us to investigate

460
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,790
unexplained activity in your home,

461
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:57,893
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

462

Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

463
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:00,663
and we'll help if we can.

464
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,921
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

465
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:14,423
on a property that's seen more
than a half a dozen deaths.

466
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,746
But I need to see if
there's anything else

467
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:16,912
that could help my case.

468
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:21,035
Searching through city
records, I find a crime

469
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:23,458
involving a vigilante
group called the White Caps.

470
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,506
Turns out, they nearly
beat a man to death

471
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,924
right next to my client's property.

472
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,579
I'm on my way to meet
with a local researcher

473
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:34,415
who says this gang
terrorized the entire region.

474
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:44,458
This article I came
across showed that a guy

475
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:48,229
got beaten up on or right
near my client's property

476
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:50,298
by a group of guys called White Cappers.

477
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,500
I've never even heard of
them. What the hell is that?

478
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:55,303
White Caps existed as secret societies

479
00:22:55,405 --> 00:23:01,809
in mainly Southern Indiana
in local, rural areas

480
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,011
that passed out vigilante justice

481
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:08,082
from around 1850
through the early 1900s.

482
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,084
Were these guys like the KKK?

483
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:13,788
They weren't racially motivated,
but there were similarities.

484
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,090
The articles indicated
they wore robes...

485
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:17,992
sometimes white, sometimes dark.

486
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:18,993
Okay.

487
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,728
But they felt that they had the right

488
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,831
to enforce the moral
code of their community.

489
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:25,637
What kind of people would they target?

490
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,703
Drunks, adulterers, prostitutes,

491
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:34,684
unwed mothers, petty thievery,
or not attending church.

492
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:39,114
There are, like, a group of men,

493
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:41,550
and they're all linked arm in arm.

494
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:44,886
There is maybe 10 of them.

495
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:51,059
These things are pretty
powerful, very aggressive.

496
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:57,994
As far as them directly
interacting with the living,

497
00:23:58,094 --> 00:24:01,595
I think that they would feel a sense

498
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:07,201
of absolutely being
watched and feeling stalked

499
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:12,206
and feeling extreme fear,
like you're being hunted.

500
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:15,476
And they want that to be their message.

501
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,657
Okay.

502
00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:19,206
So now that I know
who White Cappers are,

503
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:20,505
what do you know about the beating

504
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,841
that this guy got near
my client's property?

505
00:24:22,943 --> 00:24:26,745
One evening...
February 14, 1890...

506
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:30,716
there was a man by the
name of Fleming Bremmer

507
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:34,853
who was coming home,
going through Patricksburg.

508
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:38,123
A group of men in
dark robes grabbed him,

509
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:41,293
took him through an
orchard, tied him to a tree,

510
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:43,629
and pulled the branches off the trees

511
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,265
and whipped him till
he was a bloody mess...

512
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,034
- Okay...
- and left him there unconscious.

513
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:50,902
And he didn't wake up till morning.

514
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,437
Well, it's lucky this guy
didn't freeze to death,

515
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:53,739
let alone from the beating.

516
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:55,741
Do we know what the White
Cappers went after him?

517
00:24:55,843 --> 00:25:00,045
He had been warned that he
had been abusive to his mother.

518
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:03,949
And so that was what
led to this incident.

519
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:05,584
Okay. So, was anybody charged?

520
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:06,752
No.

521
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,086
Today, they would
never get away with it.

522
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:11,657
In the hills of Southern
Indiana during the late 1800s...

523
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,658
Right.

524
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,826
There wasn't always the sheriffs

525
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:18,279
and the police and the courts.

526
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,501
I don't think they want anybody here.

527
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:26,592
And there's also no denying
the feeling that they invoke,

528
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,111
which is that you're being hunted.

529
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,133
They've gone to where
this is a sport for them.

530
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:40,063
This is, like, wicked bad.

531
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,506
During my walk, I saw
several dead people,

532
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:50,772
but two stood out the most.

533
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,663
First, the cowboy.

534
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:58,201
He was probably in his
mid-to late-30s, very thin.

535
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:01,204
He had a black cowboy hat on,

536
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:06,376
and he had a very thick mustache.

537
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:07,377
Okay.

538
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,778
Next, I described a demon

539
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,148
who was using a dead little
girl to torment a living person.

540
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,317
She was dressed like a doll.

541
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:19,756
Behind her, which was
this tall, dark thing,

542
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,125
and it had its hands on her shoulders

543
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:25,528
and its fingers went like
halfway down her body.

544
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,513
So it's, like, controlling her.

545
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,667
Is this what you saw?

546
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,037
Yes. That's what I saw.

547
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:55,906
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

548
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:57,539
we're ready to reveal our findings

549
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,908
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

550
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:02,410
Amy, I'd like you to meet Sonya.

551
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:06,285
She grew up in the house right
across from the barn here,

552
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:10,387
and she was tortured by
the activity growing up.

553
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:11,721
Now, a few months ago,

554
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,225
she was able to get out of a
very bad, abusive relationship

555
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:17,894
and had to move back here
with one of her daughters.

556
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:20,530
Now, here's how it's
working out for her.

557
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:22,466
She's so afraid of the house

558
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:26,636
that she's living in this
RV that's in the front lawn.

559
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,271
So that's why we're
doing the reveal here

560
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,607
'cause she doesn't want
to be in that house.

561
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,176
This is Pam. This is Sonya's mom.

562
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,278
And this is Chad, her brother.

563
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,614
Here's where the twist comes in.

564
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:40,817
Pam is getting ready
to retire and move out

565
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,652
and wants to give the house to the kids,

566
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,188
but they don't think it's safe.

567
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,991
So with that, I'm gonna have
Amy tell us about her walk

568
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,934
and how things went.

569
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:56,333
When I first got
here, I saw a group of men.

570
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,602
There were about 10 of them.

571
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:02,672
And they roam around
the entire property.

572
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:06,185
The living would experience
them in various ways.

573
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:09,480
These guys make you feel
like you're being watched

574
00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:12,749
and, specifically, hunted.

575
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:15,219
It's like that's what
I kept feeling like.

576
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:18,388
I was being hunted like an animal.

577
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:21,191
I felt like being watched real bad...

578
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:23,127
Yeah... just, like, with pure hate,

579
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:25,462
and just so bad that you had to move.

580
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:28,031
You couldn't just stand
there. You had to go.

581
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:30,601
I'll be sitting in the
living room, watching TV,

582
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:35,339
and it's just like I
know they're watching me.

583
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:39,209
The creepy thing about them is
that they do not want anybody

584
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,311
on this land.

585
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:41,891
All right. The only
thing I can think of...

586
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:43,891
It's a long shot, but
there was something

587
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:46,660
I came across in my research
that I thought was interesting.

588
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:49,196
Apparently, back in the late 1800s,

589
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:52,466
there was a gang of moral
vigilantes called White Cappers.

590
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:55,436
Now, they performed
violence against anybody

591
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:57,371
that they thought
were acting amorally...

592
00:28:57,473 --> 00:29:00,441
unwed mothers, hobos, drunks.

593
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:02,309
They beat women. They beat men.

594
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:03,611
Didn't matter who it was.

595
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:05,613
They'd only attack at night,

596
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:09,350
and when they would do attacks,
they'd wear robes and wear...

597
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:12,019
Oh, no.

598
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:13,120
Either white or black hoods.

599
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:14,488
Oh.

600
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,291
One of the victims was
beaten right on the property.

601
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:18,392
Oh, my God.

602
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:21,028
His name was Fleming Bremmer.

603
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,231
He was a white male
who was 51 years old.

604
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,967
Apparently, he was
abusive to his mother.

605
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,404
Now, you guys had a big reaction
when I mentioned the robes.

606
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:31,538
Tell Amy why.

607
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,707
When I was probably
about 8 years old or so,

608
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,243
and I had six...

609
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:39,647
three up against the wall,
three on the side of the bed.

610
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,516
They had no faces,
had their arms folded.

611
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:43,617
I woke up the next morning

612
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,252
and told my mom what had happened,

613
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:47,054
and that's when she
sat me down that morning

614
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:50,591
and told me that she had had
that same thing happen to her.

615
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:52,059
I woke up in the middle of the night,

616
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:55,062
and there was four hooded
figures around my bed.

617
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:58,432
And I screamed until
Mom got up and came in.

618
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:01,138
Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense.

619
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:04,405
What else did you see?

620
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:05,806
When I walked into the house,

621
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:11,078
I came across a couple of
dead people that concerned me.

622
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,047
One of them is an older male.

623
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,082
He's extremely active in the house,

624
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,818
and he's a big problem here.

625
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,922
He affects the living in a lot of ways.

626
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:22,390
He does yell a lot,

627
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:26,494
so people might hear a voice,
humming, or buzzing sound.

628
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,696
He pounds on the walls.

629
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:29,997
I got very concerned, though,

630
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,167
when I walked into the
first bedroom down the hall.

631
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:34,936
That's Chad's room.

632
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,673
His sights were set on
whoever was in there.

633
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,875
I saw him on the bed,
sitting over this person,

634
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:43,732
literally reaching into their chest,

635
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:46,771
touching their heart and
trying to squeeze the heart,

636
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,973
trying to give the
person a heart attack.

637
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,941
That would be me.

638
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,753
I felt like someone
was underneath my bed,

639
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:57,122
pulling the sheet
down tight around me...

640
00:30:57,224 --> 00:31:00,225
Mm-hmm... compressing my chest

641
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:02,261
to the point where I
I could not move.

642
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:04,263
I couldn't breathe.

643
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,732
I think there's a family connection

644
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,233
between him and the living here.

645
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:09,735
I got that he was somebody's grandfather

646
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,670
or great-grandfather.

647
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:14,773
Somewhere, a very long time ago,

648
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,142
there was a marriage that
occurred in the family

649
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:19,745
that was not deemed appropriate.

650
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:22,714
And ever since that marriage took place,

651
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:25,250
there's, like, a family curse.

652
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,654
Whoever shows the dominant
traits of the individual

653
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:31,890
that was deemed inappropriate
for the marriage,

654
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,443
they are the ones who are targeted.

655
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:35,987
I wouldn't be surprised,

656
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:39,190
if you take a look back
at your mother's line,

657
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:43,061
and see how they met
their demise, some of them.

658
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:46,864
There might be some
unusual issues there.

659
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,733
- There are.
- Yes.

660
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:49,767
- There are.
- There are.

661
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:52,770
You're gonna have to tell them.

662
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,339
Wow.

663
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:58,576
I mean, my mom was very promiscuous.

664
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:00,678
She was married seven times.

665
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,880
She was shot.

666
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,315
She was with a guy

667
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:09,721
that got his head blown off
by her soon-to-be ex-husband.

668
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:14,144
I mean, we were raised going
to maybe five different schools

669
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:15,544
- in a year...
- Oh, my goodness.

670
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:18,647
Watching her being beat all the time.

671
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:20,015
And I worry about her

672
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:25,187
because she... takes after
her in a lot of those ways.

673
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:28,423
Interesting.

674
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,526
Now, Amy, you mentioned unusual
deaths within the family.

675
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:35,897
This is Pam's brother Jeff,

676
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,795
who passed away a few years
ago by committing suicide.

677
00:32:40,037 --> 00:32:42,704
He spent a lot of time here,
too, as a matter of fact.

678
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,907
We were more like brothers.

679
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:47,543
It was definitely over a woman.

680
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,712
I don't know much about curses,
but it's a doozy of a curse.

681
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:51,820
Yes.

682
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:59,584
So then I met another dead
guy, and he's very active here.

683
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:03,186
One of the things that
he does to get attention

684
00:33:03,288 --> 00:33:04,787
is he does, like,

685
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,025
show himself as a, like, a
five-foot-tall shadow person.

686
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:10,827
But he's about 5'10 ", 5'11".

687
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,263
He can go all over
the property...

688
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,364
inside, outside, everywhere.

689
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:15,632
He likes the living room,

690
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:18,401
and he likes the back bedroom the best.

691
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:21,067
He wants a lot of attention,
so he does act out.

692
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,541
He's dressed all in black.

693
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,877
I got a very cowboy vibe from him.

694
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:28,778
I thought he was in his 30s.

695
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,847
I saw him holding a gun.

696
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:35,752
I...would say that would be Raymond.

697
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:37,621
We're talking about Sonya's ex-husband,

698
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:40,190
who also committed suicide.

699
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:53,904
You okay, honey?

700
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,439
Mm-hmm. I don't know.

701
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,635
I guess I just didn't really
figure him to stick around here.

702
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,645
Well, I did have a sketch done,

703
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:04,148
so you can tell me what you think.

704
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:12,723
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me?

705
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,192
I think it looks a lot like him.

706
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:16,994
- I think it could be.
- I really do.

707
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,597
The Adam's apple is so prominent.

708
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,399
So, what do you think?

709
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,034
After hearing what
they're saying about him...

710
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:26,470
Yeah. I think it's him.

711
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:28,372
Why would he stay here?

712
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,340
Why would he not go where I go?

713
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,876
There's something about your mother

714
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:39,183
that he's attached to,
and he feels comfortable.

715
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,332
You've been through hell, kid.

716
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:44,288
Yeah. I was young.

717
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,790
Got a lot of guilt with both of them.

718
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:57,868
This is where, to me,
things got really weird.

719
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,838
Uh-oh. The little girl...

720
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,028
This girl looked really sweet,

721
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,998
and to me, she was just pure innocence.

722
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,000
I can tell that you
like the little girl,

723
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:14,076
and this is not gonna be good news.

724
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:17,544
I saw two graves of children.

725
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:20,380
One was a female,

726
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:23,383
like 9 to 12 or something in there.

727
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,385
The other was a little boy.

728
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:29,456
I do believe that the girl got
sick and died from an illness.

729
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:33,393
And I believe she died
somewhere on this land.

730
00:35:33,495 --> 00:35:37,664
And I would place the young
girl in, like, the 1900s,

731
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,933
by her little outfit.

732
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:44,371
There are two kids that
you described who did live

733
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,239
and died right on the property.

734
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:48,775
The land was owned by a guy
named Stephen Macgerlein.

735
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:51,945
He lived here from 1864 to 1915.

736
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:55,715
In 1872, his 2-year-old
son, Frederick,

737
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:59,786
died in a horrible accident
in the family's gristmill.

738
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:03,523
Now, in 1888, Macgerlein's
daughter Hermione

739
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,459
died from typhoid fever.

740
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:08,295
Now, the kicker is, both
those kids are buried

741
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,730
in one of the cemeteries
right next door to you.

742
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,299
Oh, wow.

743
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,000
So, what's the little girl do here?

744
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:16,836
She was in the middle bedroom.

745
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,405
That's your old room.

746
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:19,639
Yes.

747
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:21,274
She was standing at the edge of the bed

748
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,810
and just staring straight
ahead at the person in the bed.

749
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:26,513
It was very creepy.

750
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:30,928
I realized that the dead
girl was pretty much gone.

751
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:32,819
And behind her,

752
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,822
I see this dark thing
standing and controlling her.

753
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:40,539
He was very tall and creepy
and had extremely long fingers.

754
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,674
Now, I've seen a creature,
is what I described it as...

755
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:51,117
four feet tall, humanoid
with long, white hair.

756
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:56,019
But it had fingers that
were probably this long.

757
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,890
So I had a sketch done of
what I saw in the bedroom.

758
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,442
That's it.

759
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:20,510
Oh, my God.

760
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,720
So I had a sketch done
of what I saw in the bedroom.

761
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:48,718
That's it.

762
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,187
Oh, my God.

763
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:03,533
Do you think they were
gonna cause me harm?

764
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:11,607
There is a demon or
a demonic presence...

765
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:16,145
that is utilizing a deceased girl.

766
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:20,883
The intention there is
to possess the individual

767
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:22,151
that was in this bed.

768
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:25,037
All right.

769
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,204
So, are you saying that
this thing that you had drawn

770
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,975
is a demon and is
trying to get to Sonya?

771
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,575
Yes.

772
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:35,412
And it's also projecting those
hooded figures you've all seen.

773
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,847
That's what I thought.

774
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:41,852
That's how I felt because
it was such hate and malice

775
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:44,021
that you felt.

776
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:47,057
And I always wondered
in the back of my mind

777
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,358
if it was demonic.

778
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,763
When I was a child, I
had a dream of, like,

779
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:56,633
these nails over me and being
scratched on my forehead.

780
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,302
And as I... when I
woke up that morning,

781
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,351
there was that scratch on my forehead.

782
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:07,845
I really think that this goes
back to this initial curse.

783
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:10,314
Whoever placed this curse

784
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:14,285
was very well-versed in how to do it...

785
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,924
And brought in this
kind of demonic presence.

786
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:24,628
I think that it's through your line.

787
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,240
Never in my wildest imagination
did I think there was this much.

788
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:37,212
So now, Sonya, after hearing
what Amy has told us tonight,

789
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:38,411
it's pretty clear

790
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,489
you haven't had a day of
peace in your entire life.

791
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,582
I'm really hoping tonight's
a turning point for you,

792
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,584
as well as everybody else at the table.

793
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,020
And it starts by answering
one big question...

794
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:49,589
Can you kick out whatever
the hell's in the house

795
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,825
so that you and your
daughter can move in

796
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:53,860
and start your lives over, basically?

797
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:56,129
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

798
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:04,170
There is a lot that needs to be done,

799
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:08,074
and the first thing is
to find a group of shamen

800
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:11,143
because there is some
type of demonic force

801
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:14,547
that's been following the
family as part of this curse.

802
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:17,950
What they will do is a curse unraveling,

803
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:22,188
a cord cutting, a removal
of all the negative energies,

804
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,990
and then they will also do protections

805
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:27,760
to lock down the land and the house.

806
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,395
What the cord cutting will do

807
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:33,132
is it will remove any and
all invisible attachments

808
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:37,270
that you've made to any
dead people or entities.

809
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:42,996
So once all of that's done,
then Raymond must be moved on.

810
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:49,900
I would like an older female,
gentle medium go into your room

811
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:54,425
and have a session with
him and help him to move on.

812
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:58,809
It's just hard to...

813
00:40:58,911 --> 00:41:00,578
I mean, I want him to move on.

814
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,079
And I always...

815
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,414
I guess I always was hoping

816
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:05,683
that he was watching over his daughter

817
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,659
and not stuck here.

818
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:11,822
Oh, it's just
That's hard.

819
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:13,124
Well, now you have a chance.

820
00:41:13,226 --> 00:41:17,328
You know exactly where he is,
and you can help him to go.

821
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,231
So, Sonya, you're gonna
listen to Amy's advice on this?

822
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,799
- Definitely.
- Mom?

823
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,200
Oh, absolutely.

824
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:25,202
I think we can put them
on their heels pretty

825
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:27,271
- pretty quick.
- So once this gets done,

826
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:29,407
you think you're gonna move
up here with your daughter?

827
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:30,741
I wouldn't mind it.

828
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:32,076
I just don't want Cassie to go through

829
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:33,411
the same thing I went
through as a child.

830
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:36,944
Removing the demon needs
to happen immediately for Sonya

831
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:39,255
and her family to protect their souls.

832
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:42,944
In doing so, they'll free
the dead and break the curse

833
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,278
that's been plaguing their
family for generations.
