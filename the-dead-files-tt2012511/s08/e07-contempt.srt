1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,114
Somebody's bleeding in here.

2
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:14,983
My back was burning,
and there was a bite mark

3
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:16,718
on the small of my back.

4
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,186
Oh, my god.

5
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,689
They're hanging on to my [bleep] spine.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,824
He stabs her approximately 50 times.

7
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:23,892
50 times?

8
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,994
It's like

9
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:28,764
I think people are gonna
end up getting hurt.

10
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:32,033
Threatening, "I'm going to get you."

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,870
That thing's nasty.

12
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:37,439
There's a dark presence.

13
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,574
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:41,576
These things, they're freaking out.

15
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:42,978
They're from hell.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,079
I see dead people.

17
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,347
They were being hunted.

18
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:47,115
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,998
They were setting people on fire,

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,999
burning them alive.

21
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,356
And they speak to me.

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,655
Her neck got broken.

23
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:55,625
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

24
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,627
I hear a gunshot.

25
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,195
I rely on my partner.

26
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,813
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

27
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,665
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

28
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:03,849
Something's not right here.

29
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:07,236
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

30
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:08,404
It's not safe here.

31
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:09,472
It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,073
Are any of them buried on the property?

33
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:12,208
They're all buried here.

34
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,393
But Steve and I never speak...

35
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,426
We never communicate
during an investigation.

36
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:17,828
Until the very end...

37
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,096
I can't do it no more.

38
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,164
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

39
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,033
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

40
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,484
Or time to get out.

41
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:25,969
It does not have a happy ending.

42
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,271
Something kills people here.

43
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:43,215
I'm up here in North Haven, Connecticut,

44
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,801
right near Yale University.

45
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,719
I got a call from a kid named Anthony.

46
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,221
Now, he just got married

47
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,508
and moved back into his parents'
house with his new husband.

48
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:55,577
Once he did that, all hell broke loose.

49
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,363
Now he thinks his entire
family's in trouble.

50
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,700
He begged us to come
out here and investigate.

51
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:06,471
Hopefully, Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this.

52
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:07,706
Before Amy arrives,

53
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:10,092
I clear the house of
any leading information,

54
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:15,247
removing photographs and
covering personal items.

55
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:18,517
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

56
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,161
There's this older lady.

57
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:31,396
She is kind of a leader.

58
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,232
Interesting. Okay.

59
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,589
She's not happy I'm
here, like, not at all.

60
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,807
The old woman,

61
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:46,912
and two dead elderly men are with her.

62
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:49,715
She can manipulate them very easily.

63
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,816
She's very physical.

64
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,651
So are her little henchmen.

65
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,987
Their intentions are not good.

66
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:03,065
So, Anthony, I'm glad I'm here

67
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,482
because you sounded really
desperate on the phone.

68
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,766
Yeah, I'm living in hell.

69
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,002
I'm terrified to come in this house.

70
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,587
We need help.

71
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,623
I can't do this where
I see my mom crying,

72
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:18,528
and everyone is miserable, and...

73
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:19,924
Okay. So who else is in the house?

74
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:22,391
Here is actually my whole family.

75
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,742
Okay. So who's who here?

76
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:25,894
- This is my brother, Richard.
- Okay.

77
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,696
- That's my mom.
- Okay.

78
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,848
That's my dad. He's actually a cop.

79
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,266
- Your father's a cop?
- Yeah.

80
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:33,552
And that's my younger brother, Louie.

81
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,988
- Okay.
- And then, that's me.

82
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,439
Now, Anthony, you
mentioned that you think

83
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,325
things got worse when
you and Carlos moved in.

84
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,609
Yeah.

85
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:42,811
Think that kind of caused
or triggered something?

86
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,424
Seems like it, yeah. It
seems like it made it angry.

87
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,724
Okay. So what kind of
things are we talking about?

88
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,377
We're hearing noises, footsteps,

89
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,029
and things are disappearing, moving.

90
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:58,535
We're seeing apparitions,
physical attacks, and illnesses.

91
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,903
What kind of illnesses we talking about?

92
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:04,140
Headaches, blurred
vision, dizziness, nausea.

93
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,625
And recently, I was
actually hospitalized

94
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,927
with a heart condition.

95
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,512
How old are you?

96
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,863
22.

97
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:11,364
So what was the heart condition about?

98
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,350
I had a really bad chest pain,

99
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,051
and when I was in the hospital,

100
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,304
they couldn't figure out what it was.

101
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:18,972
Are you doing any kind of
dope, any kind of drugs,

102
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,307
anything like that?

103
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,892
Don't [bleep] with me.
I'm serious about that.

104
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:22,893
Never.

105
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,011
Okay. Why don't you just move?

106
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,047
This is my childhood home.
I would love to stay here.

107
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:31,635
But whatever it is, is
ruining us as a family,

108
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,970
and it's, like, tearing us apart,

109
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,273
and we need help.

110
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:40,293
I think people are gonna
end up getting hurt.

111
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,646
Okay.

112
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:47,117
Oh, no.

113
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:51,321
I'm having a heart issue in here.

114
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,857
I think that there's a living male

115
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,309
who's having heart problems.

116
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:02,032
The elderly group of people
is influencing this person

117
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,700
because they're vulnerable.

118
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:06,102
He already has medical issues,

119
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,471
and they're taking advantage of that.

120
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:11,541
It's kind of scary because
they could cause this person

121
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,810
to have a heart attack and die.

122
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:16,346
They try to get him when he's alone.

123
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,490
Ugh, okay.
I'm...

124
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,077
I'm feeling it a little bit.

125
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,729
He gets panicked and freaked out.

126
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:35,732
I don't know why they're
trying to kill him.

127
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,306
All right. So what's going on?

128
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,941
I call it the top hat man.

129
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,410
It's just pure black.

130
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,613
It's, like, a silhouette of a man...

131
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,147
- Okay.
- with a top hat.

132
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,515
Any kind of features?

133
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,717
- No.
- Okay.

134
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,868
It's just solid black.

135
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,753
Okay. And you saw that in which bedroom?

136
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:57,821
- In my bedroom.
- In this one?

137
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,723
Yes.

138
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,825
Just standing there.

139
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,326
Now, is anything else going on?

140
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,896
We've seen blood, actual,
physical blood within the house.

141
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,999
- Where?
- In this hallway,

142
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,483
in the bathroom,

143
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,136
down the stairs and right in
front of the basement door.

144
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,671
All right. So let me get this straight.

145
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:15,872
We're talking about actual what
you think is physical blood?

146
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,007
Yes.

147
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,623
Now, you got a red
light in the bathroom.

148
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,104
Yes.

149
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,303
You sure it couldn't have been water

150
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,671
that looked like blood
because of the light?

151
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:22,672
Nope.

152
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,008
You guys have any pets at that time?

153
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,240
We did. We had a dog.

154
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:28,198
My dad had checked the
whole dog, checked his paws,

155
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,097
- checked everything.
- What did he think?

156
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,167
He tried everything he could
to figure out what it was.

157
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,453
I remember he got my mom's nail polish.

158
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,954
He got her lipstick.

159
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,059
And nothing could match
what was on the floor.

160
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,427
This is some
off-the-wall stuff.

161
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,495
Yeah.

162
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,796
This blood thing's a first

163
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:47,048
in all these investigations I've done.

164
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,198
I've never heard anything like this.

165
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:49,680
When I was growing up,
I had seen a lot of stuff

166
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,265
in this house.

167
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:53,634
But now, it's actually almost
like it's interacting with us,

168
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,803
like, attacking people.

169
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:02,243
Somebody's bleeding in here.

170
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:06,681
I'm seeing hands and
blood, blood on the floor.

171
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:09,951
How much? Where?

172
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:12,487
Quite a bit.

173
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,905
Definitely goes out the door.

174
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:16,874
I don't know where it goes, though.

175
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,899
So, Carlos, I understand you and Anthony

176
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,148
moved in here a year ago.

177
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:27,448
- Yes.
- And I understand

178
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,199
that you've had experiences.

179
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,485
Yes. We were downstairs,
and we were on the couch.

180
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,654
And all the sudden, the
blanket that was on the couch,

181
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:36,490
just, like, someone picked
it up and dropped it.

182
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:37,808
Were you guys awake, or...?

183
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:39,693
Yeah, we were awake.
We were watching TV.

184
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,495
And nobody was in the house
playing games with you guys?

185
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,831
No. We were alone downstairs.

186
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,383
I can't even think what
the hell nonparanormal

187
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,668
that would've caused that.

188
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,169
Anything else like that happen?

189
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:51,522
Yeah, there was a banging
at the end of the bed.

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,740
So we're talking about one of these?

191
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,041
Yeah.

192
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,959
It woke me up.

193
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:58,729
But I didn't open my
eyes 'cause I was scared

194
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,347
- to see what was there.
- Okay.

195
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,716
So that's happened several times.

196
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:04,585
And this is when the two of
you guys were in bed together?

197
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:05,703
Yes.

198
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,023
I've had cases before where dead people

199
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,774
may not approve of your lifestyle.

200
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,344
We've thought of that.
Anthony's mom thinks it's me.

201
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:16,063
- You?
- Yes.

202
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,481
And why's she think that?

203
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,683
Well, she says that when I
first started coming here,

204
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,119
that's when the activity picked up.

205
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:23,370
You ever think about just moving?

206
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,739
No. Well, we know that
we love each other,

207
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:29,043
and we're gonna be together, so
we're gonna fight this together.

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,515
There's a living person getting shoved,

209
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,717
but it's against the wall.

210
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:40,988
Like, they're coming
out, and they're like...

211
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,122
La, la-la-la-la!...

212
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,757
And then just like, "Ow."

213
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:44,892
Like, you know what I mean?

214
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:46,844
And this is a male, yeah.

215
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,479
I'm feeling a younger male.

216
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:52,750
He's kind of metrosexual.

217
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:56,203
The person being shoved into the walls

218
00:08:56,305 --> 00:09:02,709
is due to the elderly
woman and her henchmen.

219
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:12,886
I don't know why these
dead people are doing this.

220
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:15,656
It's causing, like, a breakdown.

221
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:17,558
It's really horrible.

222
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,752
So, Terry, I
was talking to Anthony.

223
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,352
He thinks that when he
moved in here with Carlos,

224
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,904
that things kind of amped up.

225
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:45,455
I agree.

226
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,040
Do you think it has to
do with their lifestyle,

227
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:49,459
or do you think it's because
Carlos is new to the house?

228
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:52,029
I'm not sure if it's because they're gay

229
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:54,948
or if it's because we
brought someone new in

230
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,100
and whatever is here didn't want it.

231
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,419
I mean, how did you, if
you don't mind me asking,

232
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:02,172
take the news that
Anthony was... was gay?

233
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,007
Um, not very well.

234
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,510
It took a while to get through that.

235
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,378
And I struggled with
the fact that I felt

236
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,981
that I was never gonna have
grandchildren or anything.

237
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,282
So, Terry, let's get to you.

238
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:13,934
What about your
experiences? What's going on?

239
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,703
I've been touched in my sleep.

240
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,221
Okay. In what manner?

241
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,424
Just a push on my shoulder.

242
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:24,044
First, I thought I was dreaming,
but you know how you come to,

243
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,729
and you realize you're not dreaming?

244
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,297
It terrified me so bad.

245
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,815
My husband was working overnight.

246
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,000
So I called him home,

247
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,069
had him come home and stay with me.

248
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,270
So what else is going on?

249
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:35,305
I have a really difficult time sleeping.

250
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,808
I have a lot of nightmares.

251
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,510
I wake up terrified,
and I don't know why.

252
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:43,914
You can't sleep. It's scary to sleep.

253
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:52,522
Whoa. There's a lot of anxiety up here.

254
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,058
Lots of fear in living people here.

255
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:56,393
They can't sleep.

256
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:57,994
They can't eat.

257
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,447
This is really bad. Okay.

258
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,032
The three elderly people

259
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:05,635
are doing this to the
living people here.

260
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:09,039
I do feel like a female is
definitely perceiving this.

261
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,994
Not sleeping, I think,
is making them worse.

262
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,649
Like, they're really falling
into a horrible depression.

263
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:23,687
And it's, like, really nearing,
like, a mental breakdown

264
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,088
because of all of this.

265
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,760
These dead people are totally
taking advantage of that.

266
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:31,595
Oh, my God.

267
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,601
Okay, so what else is going on?

268
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:40,854
One night, the whole family was
playing a game in the kitchen,

269
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,556
and we had a water bottle

270
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:45,142
that went from the kitchen
into the living room.

271
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,543
So where was the bottle?

272
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,161
The bottle was on the floor.

273
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,746
Well, you got a water
bottle here. Can I use this?

274
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,531
Certainly.

275
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,853
As if somebody kicked it,

276
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,355
and it just rolled right
into the living room?

277
00:11:58,457 --> 00:12:00,290
Right. Right into the living room.

278
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:03,677
Whether that's
paranormal or not, I...

279
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,228
I don't know.

280
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,930
All right. What else
is going on down here?

281
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:09,116
That same night, when
we were playing the game,

282
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,669
the light was swaying back and forth.

283
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:13,787
This chandelier here?

284
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:17,457
Yes.

285
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,477
All right. So this is not stiff. So...

286
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,945
- Right.
- Anybody hit it?

287
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,613
- Nobody hit it.
- Was the door open?

288
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,198
- Was there any wind?
- No.

289
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,583
Was anything else going on in here?

290
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,952
One morning, when everybody
was getting around for work,

291
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:32,255
they came down, and every
cabinet in here was wide open.

292
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:34,224
These aren't easy to open.

293
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,960
Right. They were all open.

294
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:38,512
Nobody playing jokes?

295
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,615
Everybody denies that they
had anything to do with it.

296
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:49,923
I'm seeing lots of stuff
happening in the kitchen,

297
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,508
physical phenomena.

298
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:54,311
I'm seeing, like,
these chairs...

299
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:57,147
They're all nice like this.

300
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,783
Person turns, turns around.

301
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,202
They're all pulled out, all pulled out.

302
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:05,722
And then, these are open.

303
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:07,741
Lots of stuff happening in the kitchen,

304
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,878
like, movement of objects.

305
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,263
I already know why.

306
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:16,967
Person here has P.K. abilities.

307
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,301
Do you see the person?

308
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:20,303
Female, shorter than me.

309
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,706
She's, like...

310
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,174
maybe, like, 45.

311
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,009
She's got brown hair.

312
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:29,813
The P.K. manifestation,
it's, like, grumbling

313
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:33,133
and, like, hissing.

314
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:38,772
That is a pretty intense personality.

315
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,056
Gets yelling.

316
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:41,258
How large is it?

317
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,626
Well, right now, it's not so big

318
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:45,295
because it made itself smaller.

319
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:49,499
It looks like an inkblot with arms.

320
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:52,193
And half human?

321
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,147
It can make, like, a
head with eyes and mouth,

322
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,432
but that's it.

323
00:13:56,551 --> 00:14:01,554
It's, like, saying really
negative, bad words to me.

324
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,222
That thing's nasty.

325
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,331
I understand you're
Richard's girlfriend.

326
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,549
- Yeah.
- Okay.

327
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:15,217
And you've spent a lot of time here?

328
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:16,569
No.

329
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:17,737
Okay, why not?

330
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,473
I was sleeping one night,
and I felt like someone

331
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,691
was holding the blankets over my head.

332
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,845
I just panicked. I was trying
to move. I couldn't move.

333
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,847
I fought it, and I got
out of the blankets.

334
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,999
I was sweating. I was crying.

335
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,618
Okay. I can see now
you're upset about it.

336
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:34,336
You sure this wasn't a nightmare?

337
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,355
No, definitely not a nightmare.

338
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,873
I could see the light from the TV.

339
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,926
I could hear Anthony and Carlos
in the other room, talking.

340
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,094
Is anything else going on in here?

341
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,763
I was sleeping one night.

342
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,431
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

343
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,467
And I could see a shadow figure.

344
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,835
I was just terrified.

345
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,871
Can you describe that
shadow figure for me at all?

346
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,790
It was almost like a shadow creature.

347
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:57,660
Like, its arms were bent
back. Its legs were bent back.

348
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,744
Okay.

349
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,614
Had no eyes, just holes.

350
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,682
How big was this thing?

351
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,084
Size of a pillow.

352
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,786
- Oh, small?
- Yeah.

353
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:07,987
I was so shaken up.

354
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,040
When we finally got
up, my back was burning.

355
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,759
And I went home,
and there was a...

356
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:16,061
a bite mark on the small of my back.

357
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,763
Now, do you think that whatever's here

358
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,199
is trying to drive you out
so you're not here anymore?

359
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah.

360
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:22,952
Every time I'm here,
I just get a feeling

361
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,804
that I shouldn't be here.

362
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,909
Okay, whoever created this thing

363
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:33,479
has a [bleep] problem with
the person in this room.

364
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:34,880
Why do you say that?

365
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,233
I feel like it's trying
to bite or scratch.

366
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:41,153
Burning, scratching,

367
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:42,888
hitting, pulling hair,
that kind of thing.

368
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,024
Making this person sick.

369
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:48,427
It's threatening,
threatening this person,

370
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,396
"I'm going to get you."

371
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,857
Look, I always
play devil's advocate

372
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,107
to see if there could be
a nonparanormal explanation

373
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,293
for what my clients are going through.

374
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,944
But I got to thinking
about the stuff Terry's

375
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,213
been seeing moving
around in the kitchen,

376
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,431
and I'm wondering if it had something

377
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,800
to do with the house settling.

378
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:18,935
I'm heading back there now

379
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,903
to meet up with a couple
of building inspectors

380
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,406
to see if there's any
chance that's the case.

381
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,011
Okay, so this is the
reason I called you guys.

382
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm investigating the house,

383
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,415
and there's claims
in the house of things

384
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,850
that make no sense to me.

385
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,452
They're talking about
cabinet doors in the kitchen

386
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,620
all opening up.

387
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,155
Nobody's doing it.

388
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,991
Stuff rolling on the floor on its own.

389
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,576
Have you guys ever seen anything

390
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:47,029
that would cause that
kind of activity to happen?

391
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,431
- Sure, sure.
- Okay.

392
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,732
- So it's possible?
- Yeah.

393
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:50,967
We'll take a good look at it.

394
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,602
We'll see what's going
on in the interior.

395
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,736
Then we'll report back to you.

396
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,505
Excellent.

397
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:59,175
With so much bizarre activity
going on inside Terry's house,

398
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:02,378
I need to rule out the obvious first.

399
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,082
Then I can focus on what
physical evidence can explain.

400
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,683
All right. So what'd you guys find out?

401
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,851
All right. Basically, we found a couple

402
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,720
of cosmetic stuff on the exterior here.

403
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,889
But the house itself
is... It's sound.

404
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,457
So there's nothing wrong in the house

405
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,759
that would make a bottle
just go across the floor

406
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:18,094
to the other side?

407
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:20,062
The floor, it's only off about
a half-inch from end to end.

408
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,264
That's typical for a house.

409
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,299
Cabinet doors opening all
on their own, all of them?

410
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,751
No. There's nothing
that would explain that.

411
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,404
Okay. So now I know
at least what it's not.

412
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,340
Right. There's no problem
with the house itself.

413
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,012
So when I pull the deed to the house,

414
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,131
the first family I came
up with was the Blakesleys.

415
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,250
So I called a local author
to look into it for me.

416
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,853
And he said this family
has a very wild story

417
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:45,871
that will definitely help my case.

418
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:52,931
You had mentioned on the
phone there was a wild story

419
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,199
connected with this family.

420
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,351
Yeah, it goes back to
one of the Blakesleys,

421
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,597
a woman named Sylvia,
who was born in 1816.

422
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,279
We were able to find a photo of her.

423
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,581
As you can tell, she's
a very stern woman,

424
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,234
and she was married
to a guy named Alfred,

425
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,836
who was a brickmaker.

426
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,354
- He died.
- Okay.

427
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,239
And she took over the business,

428
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,626
which is actually quite
unusual at that time,

429
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,861
for a woman to take over
a business like that.

430
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,416
She must've been a very
independent, powerful,

431
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,932
and ruthless woman.

432
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,167
Well, what do you mean by ruthless?

433
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,853
In two different cases,
Sylvia actually sued

434
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:29,140
two close family members over money.

435
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,109
Over money. Okay. Who was the first one?

436
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:36,151
Her sister and her nephew
both owed her money,

437
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,518
so she sued them to get the money back.

438
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:42,255
She ended up getting a
judge to go and put a lien

439
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,306
on all of their stuff.

440
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:44,574
On her sister and her own nephew?

441
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,826
Correct.

442
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,928
She's a real piece of work, this woman.

443
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,096
Okay. So that's the first one.

444
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,263
What was the second one?

445
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,667
Eight years later, her
son and her grandson

446
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,869
both have their own
brickmaking business,

447
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:59,740
and she sues them when
their business fell under.

448
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:01,324
And why'd she do that?

449
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,311
Well, because it would
protect her from the debtors.

450
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:06,747
And I have an article about it.

451
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:08,849
This is one cold-hearted

452
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,817
Yeah, and that's not all.

453
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:14,070
She also institutionalized
her own grand-nephew.

454
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,355
Okay. So what's the story with that?

455
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,124
This man's name is Fred Blakesley.

456
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,425
Okay.

457
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,545
And he fell in love with
Sylvia's daughter, Lucy.

458
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,613
Sylvia and her husband did not approve

459
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:27,434
of Fred Blakesley's obsession with Lucy.

460
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,170
Sylvia filed court papers
to get him committed

461
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:32,806
into the state insane asylum.

462
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,459
And here's the papers.

463
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,077
Okay. So if she's not suing the family,

464
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:38,745
she's having them committed.

465
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:41,047
Just another way to show who's boss.

466
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,055
The old woman, I know she goes way back.

467
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,474
She and her two henchmen

468
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,011
definitely lived here at some point,

469
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,214
and they had a business here.

470
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,800
I feel like one of them was her husband,

471
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,201
and he was, like, the figurehead.

472
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,737
But she was really the one in charge.

473
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:07,607
She was business.

474
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,476
I think they had a lot of money.

475
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:12,612
One of these men, I think, was in a camp

476
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:15,632
at some point, like, a
prison camp or something.

477
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:16,666
Okay.

478
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:20,120
He thinks she killed him.

479
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,589
He just... just despises her.

480
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:29,996

00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:37,704
and we'll help if we can.

485
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,990
So far, I've got
a family living in fear

486
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,991
on a property connected
to a lot of suffering.

487
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:53,776
But I need to see if there's
anything else that could help

488
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,361
my investigation.

489
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,097
Searching through old records,
I find a gruesome murder

490
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,818
involving an
18-year-old farmhand.

491
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,803
Turns out he fatally stabbed a woman

492
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:07,340
right next to my client's property.

493
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,809
So I've asked a retired
cop to look into it for me.

494
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,479
He described it as one of
the most savage homicides

495
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,347
in the town's history.

496
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:20,220
So, Jerry, thanks for meeting
me and helping me out with this.

497
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:22,272
What'd you find out about the homicide?

498
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:25,975
July 24, 1853, there was a
guy named Brazila Bradley.

499
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,694
He lived right next to
your clients' property.

500
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:29,429
Brazila takes his kids to church.

501
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:32,582
His wife, Esther Bradley, stayed
behind because she was sick.

502
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:35,168
They had an 18-year-old Irish
farmhand named Michael Jennings

503
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,836
who came there to rob 'em.

504
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,087
He discovered the wife in her house.

505
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:41,674
And he stabs her approximately 50 times,

506
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,410
cutting off her nose,
stabbing the head, the chest,

507
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:47,380
and stabbed her once so violently

508
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,532
that the tip of the knife
broke off in her breastbone.

509
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:50,650
50 times?

510
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:51,985
50 times. Crime of passion.

511
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,419
- Yeah.
- You and I both know it.

512
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,555
So I got to assume this had
to be a huge to-do back then.

513
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:56,739
All the papers.

514
00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:59,542
Here's one of the articles.

515
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:01,661
Okay.

516
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:02,929
So what happened with him?

517
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:05,481
He goes on trial. He's
convicted of murder.

518
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,217
They send him up to Newgate Prison,

519
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:08,868
which is a hell on Earth.

520
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,538
And almost a year later, he's hung

521
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,225
in front of a very large crowd,
estimated at about 400 people.

522
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:19,662
Here's an article on the
execution of Michael Jennings.

523
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,531
He deserved it.

524
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:29,355
I'm seeing that guy
bleeding from his hands again,

525
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,207
and it's, like, shock.

526
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,892
He's feeling, "What
the happened?

527
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,511
What the
happened? What's going on?"

528
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:38,531
Does not have any clue what
the just went down.

529
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,503
I'm dizzy.

530
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,204
I'm having back pain,

531
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:49,959
specifically here, very, very bad.

532
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,845
Really bad, though, really bad.

533
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:56,382
It's like like, in your ears,

534
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:57,850
and you're like, "Ah."

535
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:00,386
I don't like it.

536
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:09,696
Pain is following me.

537
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:12,565
Somebody's crawling on
the ground behind me.

538
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,335
They're hanging onto my spine.

539
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,769
It's the female.

540
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:18,905
She can hurt you.

541
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:20,807
She can hurt living people.

542
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:22,191
I need her the off.

543
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,643
Oh, I don't like this.

544
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,011
I need her off.

545
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,314
Like, now, I'm, like, all creeped out.

546
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,617
Like, maybe she's,
like, from a cemetery,

547
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,885
like, nearby or something?

548
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,220
Are we dealing with, like,

549
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,572
bodies buried here,
and they're pissed off,

550
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,358
and they're, like, wreaking havoc?

551
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:47,583
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

552
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:50,903
but the P.K. manifestation
hovering over a living person

553
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,339
has me the most concerned.

554
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:55,775
It was all black.

555
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:03,583
It had a human arm and
leg coming out of it.

556
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:10,056
And then kind of in the
center, was this female.

557
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,394
- It makes you frightened?
- Mm.

558
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,803
Amy, is this what you saw?

559
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,907
Yes, that's what I saw.

560
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:50,191
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

561
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:51,476
we're ready to reveal our findings

562
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:55,029
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

563
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,931
Amy, I'd like you to meet Anthony,

564
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,067
and this is his mom, Terry.

565
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:00,368
About a year ago,

566
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,187
Anthony moved in here
with his husband, Carlos,

567
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:05,473
and that's when all hell broke loose.

568
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:08,543
Now, I want to show you who
else lives in their house.

569
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:13,264
So this is Rich, Terry's husband.

570
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:15,550
This is Carlos, who's Anthony's husband.

571
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,019
These are his two
brothers, Louie and Richard.

572
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:20,722
Now, Anthony thinks
that when he came home,

573
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,958
he triggered something that
puts the whole family in danger.

574
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,993
And that's why he called us in.

575
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,363
Now that Amy knows a
little bit about you guys,

576
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:30,865
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

577
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:38,673
One of the first things
that I saw was upstairs,

578
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:43,594
and I saw blood all over the floor.

579
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,497
And the blood led out of the bathroom

580
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,983
and into the hallway.

581
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:53,071
I was experiencing it
through the individual

582
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,189
that had the initial experience.

583
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,558
And I saw my hands,

584
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,294
and they were a male's hands,

585
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:03,264
and they had blood on them.

586
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:09,937
And the male was feeling very confused.

587
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,408
Just... it's just wow.

588
00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:15,510
We... we found blood.

589
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:18,079
We were in the basement,
and we had opened the door,

590
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:19,547
and there was droplets of blood

591
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,365
right in front of the
door of the basement

592
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:23,651
and up the stairs, into the hallway

593
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:25,803
and through the closed
door into the bathroom.

594
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:27,438
Her husband, Rich, is a cop.

595
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,323
He investigated this thoroughly

596
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,145
and couldn't figure out
what the hell this came from.

597
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:36,531
Now, this is a long shot,

598
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:38,800
but when you said you saw a
guy acting confused with blood

599
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:40,218
on his hands,

600
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:43,004
it made me think about something
I came across in my research.

601
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:46,195
Now, in 1853, there
was a 43-year-old woman

602
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,697
named Esther Bradley that
lived next to your property.

603
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,202
And her husband and
two kids went to church,

604
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:55,654
and she wasn't feeling
well and stayed back.

605
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:59,007
An Irish farmhand that
worked for the family,

606
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:00,943
18 years old,

607
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,579
went into the house to
rob it and found her there.

608
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,714
He wound up stabbing her to death.

609
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:08,317
And he stabbed her 50 times.

610
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,986
50 times?

611
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,222
The head, the neck, the chest.

612
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,340
One of the stab wounds was
so bad he actually broke off

613
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,360
the tip of the knife in her chest.

614
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:22,297
They did catch him at the train
station with blood, the knife.

615
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,515
Stayed in jail for about a year.

616
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,566
And then, they hung him.

617
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,102
Good.

618
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,687
So what else did you see?

619
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,524
There are three
conscious dead people here

620
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:34,476
that I'm very concerned about.

621
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,746
There are two males and one female,

622
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:39,448
and they are all elderly.

623
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:44,102
The female has the two
men attached to her.

624
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,421
She's, like, the boss of these two guys.

625
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:50,576
The intentions there are
not particularly friendly.

626
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:57,165
The two men, they're very
physical, very strong.

627
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:00,235
She's extremely intelligent

628
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:04,940
and is consistently manipulating them.

629
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,809
One of the men told me,

630
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:09,695
"She has malicious intentions.

631
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,164
She's forcing us to do this."

632
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:15,150
So if they have bad intentions,
what... what are they doing?

633
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:18,070
There was definitely
physical touching and attacks,

634
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:23,091
pushing, shoving,
pinching, things like that.

635
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:26,595
I got, like, somebody being
kind of shoved into the walls.

636
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,600
I get dizzy in the stairwell.

637
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,302
Do you ever feel
yourself getting...

638
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:35,604
like you were getting pushed
into a wall and not realize it?

639
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:38,373
- Yes.
- Interesting. Okay.

640
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:40,475
The other thing
that I got...

641
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:46,982
She was making two
people in the house ill,

642
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:51,153
and the first one that I got
specifically was a living woman.

643
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:53,088
I saw her in the master bedroom,

644
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,259
and she was crying and
in a deep depression

645
00:28:57,344 --> 00:29:01,129
and that she was on the
verge of a nervous breakdown.

646
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:05,033
Oh, my God.

647
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,269
That's me. That's me.

648
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:10,806
I have been horrible all
over the place, crying.

649
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:14,276
I don't know if I should be,
like, upset or more than pissed.

650
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,111
- She's affecting two people?
- Yeah.

651
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,514
The second was a living
male having heart pain

652
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,616
- or chest pain.
- Oh, my God.

653
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,852
So significant heart problems.

654
00:29:23,937 --> 00:29:26,288
I didn't know if it
was high blood pressure,

655
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,256
high cholesterol or both.

656
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,592
This person already had this condition,

657
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:34,079
but the woman and the two guys
with her are making it worse.

658
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,631
And they're really
focused on trying to...

659
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,867
to fatally harm him.

660
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,285
- Oh, my God.
- And I don't know why.

661
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,771
I've had heart issues.

662
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,824
Just when I moved back in last year.

663
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,959
I never had problems before.
Never had a heart issue before.

664
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,544
- I mean...
- Well, how old are you?

665
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,980
22.

666
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,899
How can she do this?

667
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:56,485
I wish I could just grab her.

668
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,254
I want to strangle the

669
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,475
You ever get an idea of who she was

670
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:02,041
and who these two guys were,
maybe when they were alive?

671
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,326
This is what I got.

672
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:06,162
At least one of them,
I believe, lived here.

673
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:09,198
And the other two might
have lived around or nearby.

674
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,768
I think they owned a business here,

675
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,605
and at least one of them
died here on the land.

676
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,724
The female was able to control these men

677
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,978
when they were alive as well,
so it's not just in death.

678
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,947
I got that, you know,
she was pretty far back.

679
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,783
She was all about business. I
think she had a lot of money.

680
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,152
She made it very clear
that she was the one

681
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:34,156
who really called all the
shots, especially with finances.

682
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:37,493
As far as the men, I think at one point,

683
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:38,761
one of them might have been her husband,

684
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:40,129
and then, the other guy, I...

685
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:42,665
The one thing with him was
that he had been in a camp

686
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,119
at some point, like a prison camp.

687
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:48,504
You talking about a
woman who lived here,

688
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,490
had a lot of money,

689
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:52,992
and based on some of
the things you said,

690
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,944
was a real piece of work, obviously.

691
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,262
Now, that makes me think of a woman

692
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,282
who did live on that
property, Sylvia Blakesley.

693
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:03,603
Now, Sylvia married a
guy who died in 1886,

694
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,405
and she took over his
brickmaking business.

695
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,357
Back then, in the 1800s,

696
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:10,927
a woman didn't take over a
man's business and run it.

697
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,396
She ruled with an iron
fist from what I was told.

698
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,015
She was business-savvy, ruthless.

699
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,650
She sued her own sister

700
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:20,102
and nephew over a small amount of money.

701
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,872
Next thing she wound up
doing is suing her son

702
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,675
and her grandson because
they went bankrupt,

703
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,811
and she didn't want the
creditors coming after her.

704
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:30,513
Now, you said something
about one of them guys

705
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,515
being in a prison camp.

706
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,216
In 1895,

707
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,453
her nephew Fred fell in
love with her daughter, Lucy.

708
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:40,656
So now, Sylvia wasn't too fond
of the fact that her nephew

709
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:43,592
was trying to get romantically
involved with her daughter.

710
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:46,946
So she filed papers with the courts

711
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,665
to have him committed
to an insane asylum.

712
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,133
- What?
- God.

713
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:53,469
Now, I was able to track
down a photo of her.

714
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,456
Now, do you think that
might've been the woman you saw?

715
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,425
Oh, yeah.

716
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,710
I could see it.

717
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,745
Now, you got a face

718
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,997
to what's causing some
of the problems here.

719
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:06,999
I told you they weren't good. Told you.

720
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:09,685
You did tell me that.
You did tell me that.

721
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:13,823
When I...

722
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:17,176
Okay.

723
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:23,632
When I went into the kitchen, um...

724
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,134
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

725
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,803
I'm all right.

726
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:32,675
What I saw was that you
have a fully developed

727
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:35,861
P.K. manifestation here.

728
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,946
What does that mean?

729
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,264
More than likely,

730
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:43,219
somebody within the household
has latent abilities.

731
00:32:43,354 --> 00:32:46,222
And that ability would be
telekinesis, or psychokinesis,

732
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,841
okay, which is the ability
to affect your surroundings

733
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,993
without physical contact.

734
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,464
The initial thing that happens
is a poltergeist will develop.

735
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:58,234
Oh, my gosh.

736
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,336
What can happen is that
poltergeist lingers,

737
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:02,705
and it pulls more energy and
more energy and more energy.

738
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,206
And over a lot of time,

739
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:07,543
it starts to become a
conscious, functioning,

740
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,395
independent entity.

741
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,181
Unfortunately, that's
what's happened here.

742
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:16,102
It is very aware. It's very nasty.

743
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:17,853
It has an intense personality.

744
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,972
It was yelling, hissing,
and growling at me.

745
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,557
- Oh, my God.
- It was swearing at me.

746
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,526
It's... it can
be very physical.

747
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,628
And then, I started seeing
the physical phenomena

748
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:26,829
that was happening in the kitchen,

749
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,665
like, one thing, like,
I was turned around.

750
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,967
And then, I turned back at the table,

751
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:32,968
and all the chairs had moved.

752
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:36,589
- Oh, my God.
- And I was like, "Whoa."

753
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:37,807
And then, I turn around,

754
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,875
and I saw that the cabinets were opened.

755
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,478
Oh, my God.

756
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,914
Okay, all the cabinets
were opened one morning.

757
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,616
- Every single cabinet.
- Every single one.

758
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:48,918
And the chandelier moved on its own.

759
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:50,352
The chandelier moved on its own.

760
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,654
Now, when you were telling me

761
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:52,855
about what was going on in the kitchen,

762
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,423
I had to do my due diligence

763
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:57,109
and had the house
checked by two inspectors

764
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:58,961
to see if the house was off.

765
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:01,297
It's off by a half-inch,
which is pretty common.

766
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:03,466
You have a tilt coming this way.

767
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,684
But it's not enough to have
cabinets and chandeliers

768
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:07,937
moving on their own.

769
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,789
The house is structurally sound.

770
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:11,874
So now, this thing that you're
talking about, this P.K.,

771
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,642
now, is it only in the
kitchen, this thing?

772
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:18,047
Uh, no. It's extremely active
in several of the bedrooms.

773
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:21,517
Specifically, I saw it messing
with someone in the bedroom

774
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,052
with the red comforter.

775
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:26,088
The individual who had
something to do with the creation

776
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,109
of this had a lot of
issues with this person

777
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,095
in this room, and these
are unresolved issues.

778
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:35,898
The living person in that
room is constantly hearing,

779
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:38,267
like, whispering.

780
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,870
The thing's, like,
trying to threaten them.

781
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:43,706
Like, basically, the
overall feeling and vibe

782
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:45,674
is that it's gonna get them.

783
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,010
Also, what I was
seeing was the...

784
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:52,114
It getting physical, hitting the bed.

785
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,066
I felt the mattress jolting up.

786
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:57,953
I saw it trying to bite or
scratch or burn this person

787
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:03,125
and trying to hit this
person, pulling their hair.

788
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:06,512
Now, Richard, his girlfriend, Sophie,

789
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:08,464
- she don't stay here anymore.
- Right.

790
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:11,617
She won't even come
here when it's dark out.

791
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,070
Would you mind telling Amy about
what happened to her one night?

792
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:21,544
She was held down in the bed,
and it was scratching her neck,

793
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:24,263
and something bit her.

794
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:26,715
Now, you mentioned something
about the bed shaking?

795
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,050
- Yeah.
- Happened to Carlos?

796
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:29,635
Yes, one time, he woke up,

797
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,803
and there was, like, someone banging

798
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:33,189
at the foot of the bed.

799
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,291
And someone was, like,
it was almost like they

800
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,626
were punching the bottom of
the bed through the mattress

801
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:38,961
so it would shake.

802
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:40,062
Okay.

803
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,815
What I was seeing, it was really weird.

804
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,201
And so I did have a sketch done.

805
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:53,042
This reminds me of something
that Sophie explained to me.

806
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:55,127
Oh, my God.

807
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:08,107
I've seen this face.

808
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:11,377
Everybody in the house
is seeing shadow figures

809
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,912
in different sizes.

810
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:16,432
Sophie mentioned to me that
she saw this thing pillow-sized.

811
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,734
Okay, interesting.

812
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:20,202
It can change its size.

813
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,005
It can be very small, very large.

814
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:25,891
This is the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

815
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,993
I know from working with her,
what she was saying before,

816
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,615
this P.K. is developed
from a living agent,

817
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,283
usually in the house, correct?

818
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:35,417
Yeah.

819
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,153
You have any idea who it may be?

820
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,322
What I got about this person

821
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:45,527
was that the person's
extremely stressed out, female.

822
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,065
And she had brown hair,

823
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:53,535
about 45 years old, shorter than myself,

824
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,989
going through hormonal changes.

825
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:59,358
Yep, that's me.

826
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:02,244
I'm having a little heart pain.

827
00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:10,686
So I caused this?

828
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:30,123
You okay, buddy?

829
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:31,172
Yeah. I just needed an...

830
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:33,858
All right. Just
take a deep breath.

831
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,760
I know. Okay.

832
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,061
Oh, my God.

833
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,731
- Relax.
- I know.

834
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,899
I'm feeling like I
brought all of this...

835
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,652
I know. I don't want
you to feel that way.

836
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:48,640
It's not like you did this maliciously.

837
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:50,408
It's all of your stress.

838
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,194
It's all of your pain.
It's all of your fears.

839
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,179
It's all of your anger

840
00:37:55,281 --> 00:38:00,084
and, like, things that you
weren't able to deal with.

841
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,136
And you put 'em all in this little ball,

842
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:05,156
and it's completely uncontrollable.

843
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,875
And you don't even know you have it,

844
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,312
so you can't do the
things to shut it down.

845
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,730
Listen, I... I
don't want to bring it up,

846
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,083
but I want to make sure we
diagnose this the right way.

847
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,250
You had mentioned to me, with Anthony,

848
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,736
you weren't happy about him being gay.

849
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,771
Mm-hmm.

850
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:23,474
It was very difficult, yes.

851
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:24,942
It's not your fault.

852
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:27,912
Okay, so what's your
relationship like with Sophie?

853
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,383
Richard says I hate
all of his girlfriends.

854
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,819
So I'm wondering if
that's the same situation

855
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:36,304
because what's happening to Sophie...

856
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,122
- Is happening to him.
- To Carlos.

857
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,007
It could be, yeah.

858
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:45,129
I just want to know how to stop it.

859
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,185
Well, Anthony, Terry, it's
been a tough night for you guys.

860
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:54,455
Obviously, you heard things
that you didn't want to hear,

861
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,742
but we don't pull punches.

862
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:57,175
And that's why you brought us in.

863
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,244
So now, we're gonna
answer your big question...

864
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,913
Can you figure out a way how to get rid

865
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:02,981
of whatever the hell's here

866
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,382
so that you can live
here with your husband

867
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,551
and with the rest of your family?

868
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,820
So, for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

869
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:18,327
So the first thing
that we're gonna address

870
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:20,596
is the P.K. manifestation.

871
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:23,899
There are several things that
I would like for you to do.

872
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:28,487
I want you to get what's
called craniosacral therapy.

873
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:31,507
What the practitioner will do
is they'll place their hands

874
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:34,176
on various parts of your body.

875
00:39:34,278 --> 00:39:38,797
And what this does is it's
an energetic form of healing.

876
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,149
Okay.

877
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,851
The other thing is that I would like you

878
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:45,354
to look up Tibetan monk chanting.

879
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,756
This is another way
that you can release,

880
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:50,893
physically into the
environment, beauty, okay,

881
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:55,699
and to, again, balance
your body physiologically,

882
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,198
mentally, emotionally.

883
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,450
Okay.

884
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,186
As far as the P.K. manifestation,

885
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:03,104
what's gonna happen is
over a period of time,

886
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,472
- it'll dissipate...
- Okay.

887
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,244
Because it will have
nothing to feed off of anymore.

888
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:12,013
The next thing is to get rid of

889
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,182
the three dead people that we have here.

890
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,204
What I would like is someone
who is a psychic knower

891
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:23,124
who also practices demonology.

892
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,910
Now, we don't have a demon here,

893
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:31,282
but we have very,
very nasty dead person.

894
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:34,135
The demonology part of
it, with their experience,

895
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,455
is that they're gonna
know how to exorcise her.

896
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,641
So I do want an exorcism
performed by this person

897
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:44,178
to throw her out.

898
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,616
The old men, they're
basically trapped here by her.

899
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:52,803
Once she's gone, they're
gonna want to leave.

900
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,489
If we come back in a year,

901
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:56,524
if they follow the advice you gave them,

902
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:58,326
are we gonna see
a much happier...

903
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:02,196
Oh, yeah. Oh, it'll be so, so different.

904
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:04,215
That's what we need.

905
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:07,535
I'm really rooting for you guys.

906
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,270
There's one other thing
You got to promise me

907
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:10,938
that you're not gonna beat
yourself up about this.

908
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:13,107
Well, I... of course I'm
gonna feel a little guilty,

909
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:17,812
but knowing that I can fix it
will hopefully dissipate that.

910
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:19,997
Okay. You gonna take Amy's advice?

911
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,282
I'll make it work.

912
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:22,650
Of course, absolutely.

913
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:24,685
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

914
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,871
We'll find people as soon as we can.

915
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:30,091
Thank God we know what is going on now,

916
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:32,627
and we can get rid of it.

917
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:36,334
Anthony and Terry have
a difficult road ahead of them
