1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,530
Their souls can't leave.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,630
It's like
there's a war here.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,670
This could manipulate
living people

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,100
into harming one another.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,470
Get the freak outta my head.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,240
It could kill them.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,180
Turns the ignition to the car,
and the whole car blows up.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,850
What the **** is happening?

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,590
There's something very wrong
with this land.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,750
I just hear death.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,060
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,590
God.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,660
He was like,
"I'm going to get you."

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I see dead people.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,030
Her face was all demonic.

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,830
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,570
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,970
...and they speak to me.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,500
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,640
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,640
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,140
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,510
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,020
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,590
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,790
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,690
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,660
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,730
We never communicate
during an investigation...

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,930
...until the very end...

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,560
Is this dead guy
doin' that to her?

33
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,700
...when we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,430
That's it.

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,600
...or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,170
Somebody is gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,190
I'm in Youngstown, Ohio.

38
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,290
It's a struggling city about
75 miles east of Cleveland.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,160
Now, I got a call
from a woman named Lorie.

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,870
Her story broke my heart.

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,070
She has stage IV cancer
and she knows she's gonna die.

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,440
But she believes there are
forces inside the house

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,940
trying to rip her family apart.

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,680
Her dying wish
is to kick those spirits out

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,010
and have her family
live there in peace.

46
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,250
I really hope we can help
this woman out.

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,190
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,390
I clear the house
of any leading information.

49
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,460
Family photographs, mementos

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,030
and even
Native American artifacts

51
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,760
need to be covered or removed.

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,030
When I'm finished,

53
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,070
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,210
So this is very strange.

55
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,650
The thing about this land
is that the dead can't die here.

56
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,990
Their souls can't leave.

57
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,890
A lot of 'em are roamin' around.

58
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,360
And they occasionally
are walking around in --

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,400
in through the house.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,730
You see? They're trapped.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,040
So there's something
very wrong with this land.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,050
I know this is tough
to talk about,

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,350
but you have
stage IV cancer.

64
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,850
Yes.

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,490
The chances of me
living through this...

66
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,060
It's not gonna happen.

67
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,600
The doctor said
2 months to live.

68
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,900
So the time I have,

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
I need
to make this house safe.

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,270
That's why we needed you.

71
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,570
It's heartbreaking.

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,240
But yet, you...

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,480
you're more concerned about
everybody else but yourself.

74
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, of course.
They're my family.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,250
I'm a Christian.
I know where I'm going.

76
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,650
It's okay.

77
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,420
It's just...

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,990
I don't wanna
leave my family this way.

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,930
It's like
there's a war here.

80
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,730
I have to live
until it is done.

81
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,800
Who exactly lives
in the house now?

82
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,370
My husband and I.

83
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,400
My daughter, um...

84
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,670
moved out recently.

85
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,280
She can't live here.

86
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,850
The house basically
drove her out.

87
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,550
Okay. Do you know any history
about the house?

88
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,550
My daughter was here
with her fiancé Marcus,

89
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,850
and he passed away
in the living room.

90
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,990
How long ago was this?

91
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,260
- Three, 4 years ago.
- Okay.

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
What did he die of?

93
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,000
Um, some type
of heart condition.

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,500
So I'll look into that.

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
Lorie, how long have
you guys lived here?

96
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,140
- About 19 years.
- Okay.

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,010
Did you ever talk
to the previous owners,

98
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,980
if they've had problems
or anything like that?

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,610
My mama owned this home,

100
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,250
and she gave it to us
shortly after we got married.

101
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,420
Is your mom still alive?

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,480
No. She, um...

103
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,250
- This her here?
- Yes.

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,690
- When'd she pass?
-2008.

105
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,890
- How old was she?
-78.

106
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,230
What'd she die of?

107
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,060
Breast cancer.

108
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,540
So there's a...
older woman here.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,340
So I guess she recently died
or something.

110
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,350
She has very,
very short curly hair.

111
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,950
With her, I get a lotta eights.

112
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,780
1998 or 2008.

113
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,090
She was 68.

114
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,820
She was worried about,

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,360
um, her grandchild.

116
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,230
She's afraid.

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,200
We've always had activity,
but it's gotten a lot worse.

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,140
What's goin' on
in the house?

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,570
Voices, things moving,

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,810
physical attacks,
and personality changes.

121
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,450
Okay. What do you mean
by personality changes?

122
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,720
My husband.

123
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,150
He's changed so much.

124
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,320
In what way?

125
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,760
There's times
when he'll enter a room,

126
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,030
and he's fine.

127
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,960
And he comes back,
and he has this glazed mean,

128
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,330
evil look.

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,270
I'm scared when it happens.

130
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,740
He'll say something or throw
something or punch something,

131
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,170
and then he runs outside.

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,910
You don't think it's frustration
about you and your sickness?

133
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,310
I'm sure he's frustrated,

134
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,380
but that doesn't cause
the outbursts of evil anger.

135
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,990
I've even talked to him
about possibly leaving him.

136
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,620
I mean, we've been together
22 years.

137
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,960
You break my heart.

138
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,390
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm just glad you came

140
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,640
because I know if anybody
can help, it's you.

141
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,940
I promise
I'm gonna try my best.

142
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,250
So I'm definitely
seeing a big blob.

143
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,250
And it's, like,
moving like a pulse.

144
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,450
Goes up into the ceiling.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
And then it has veins.

146
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,460
Like, it looks
like blood vessels.

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
What is this thing?

148
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,030
It's a manifestation

149
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,230
of all the negativity
that's here.

150
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,730
Sucked it all in.

151
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,970
One living person
is being eaten by this thing.

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,840
The weak ones, it gets.

153
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,970
So they're probably sick

154
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,170
or they might be dying.

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,410
Losing their personality.

156
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,010
So psychologically and mentally,
they're kind of, like...

157
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,250
not them anymore.

158
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,460
This blob
is the worst thing here.

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
So what's goin' on
in the bedroom here?

160
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,970
I have a statue
that I used to, um,

161
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,200
have just above my head.

162
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,440
And I was sleeping,

163
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,880
and it struck me real hard
in the head.

164
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,110
Was it on that lower shelf?

165
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,340
Yes.

166
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,410
It felt like it was

167
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,150
picked up and struck me,

168
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,390
like it was tryin'
to kill me.

169
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay. So anything else happen
in here?

170
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,230
I was upstairs, um, repacking
a box of Marcus' things

171
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,700
to give to my daughter.

172
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,870
Marcus is your daughter's fiancé
who died in the house.
Yes.

173
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,370
And I was grabbed
real hard and held.

174
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,510
And then I got marks on me.

175
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,040
What, like human hands
were touching you?

176
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes, like that.
I was grabbed hard.

177
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,350
And how long did that last,
that feeling?

178
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,680
About 5 minutes.

179
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,280
I think it was Marcus
trying to stop me.

180
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,920
I don't think he wanted
his stuff to leave.

181
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,590
Okay. So has anything else
physical like that happen?

182
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,190
I watched my husband

183
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,060
being shook violently
back and forth.

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,330
And he wakes up finally
and says, "What?"

185
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,930
And I go, "It wasn't me
that shook you awake."

186
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
Does he suffer from seizures
at all?

187
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,400
- Never.
- Well, you mentioned earlier

188
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,110
about your husband's
personality changes.

189
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,980
What about you?
Have you had any of that?

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,180
Yeah.

191
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,440
Okay.

192
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,810
I'll be
in the kitchen cooking,

193
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,250
and I'll get a thought
real strong.

194
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,790
Somebody talking in my head,

195
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,390
"Why don't you just take
that knife and put it in there?

196
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,390
You'll be over."

197
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,190
And I'm like, "No!"

198
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,290
How often does this happen?

199
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,160
Every day.

200
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,840
Somebody's in
the kitchen cooking.

201
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,010
And then I see, like,
a knife in my hand.

202
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,210
And I'm gonna go up
and stab that person.

203
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,750
This is, like, a vision.

204
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,150
This blob --
that's what it wants.

205
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,990
It wants people
to hurt each other

206
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,460
'cause then it gets bigger.

207
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,860
It needs to eat to stay alive,

208
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,130
to grow, to survive.

209
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,400
So, Roy, I was talkin'
to, Lorie.

210
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm sorry about
what she's goin' through.

211
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,230
She says that the house
has changed your personality.

212
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,470
Do you agree with that?

213
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,100
Yeah. I do.

214
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
So how are you being
affected emotionally?

215
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,210
Just violent thoughts.

216
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,080
You know, when you wake up
out of a sound sleep,

217
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,950
you hear a dog barkin', you know
the dog wants to go out.

218
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,490
But by the time you get to her
to let her out,

219
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,420
all you wanna do
is kill her.

220
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,660
Dog ran from me.

221
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,260
I wanted to grab her
and choke her.

222
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,060
I was chasin' her
to kill her.

223
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
Somethin's tellin' me,
"Get outside. Get outside."

224
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,970
I open the door.
I go outside.

225
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm out there
shaking my head saying,

226
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,070
"Get the freak
outta my head!"

227
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,310
It's, like, when it comes
outta me, I'll stand there.

228
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,810
And I'm, like, "What the hell
is doin' this?"

229
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,450
But if I coulda got ahold
of that dog, I woulda killed it.

230
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,460
This thing, it affects everybody
in the house.

231
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,090
It gives them, um, nightmares.

232
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,300
And visions
of hurting each other.

233
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,310
This could actually
manipulate living people

234
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,210
into harming one another.

235
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,780
Okay, so as far as experiences
go, have you had any?

236
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,720
- Bad smells.
- What kinda smell?

237
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,490
- A smell like death.
- Okay.

238
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,920
I mean, this is a big house,
and you've got woods everywhere.

239
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,390
Dead animal, maybe?

240
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,360
No. There's no dead animals
in my house.

241
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,700
All right.
Anything else?

242
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,830
I see shadows all the time.

243
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,130
Okay.
Where do you see those?

244
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,630
Mainly downstairs,
watchin' TV.

245
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,570
You can see 'em run by
the TV.

246
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,210
Have you ever seen 'em
up here?

247
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,610
Only once.

248
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,910
Okay, when was that?

249
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,310
When I was held down.

250
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,580
Tell me about what happened.

251
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,610
Well, I was sleepin'
one night.

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,220
And somethin' woke me up,
and I seen a big, black mass

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,090
over top of me,
holdin' me down.

254
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,160
It started floatin' back.

255
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,520
I jumped up outta bed
and I says,

256
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,360
"Is that all you've got,
you son of a ****?

257
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't you<i> ever</i> touch me
again."

258
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,360
And then it dissipated.

259
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,170
- Now you seem angry.
- I am angry.

260
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,900
It's, like, okay,
you wanna pick on me? Fine.

261
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,970
I could...I'll --
I'll handle it.
Right.

262
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,910
But when
you start interferin'

263
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,180
and gettin' to my family
and my wife,

264
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,550
now it's time to do somethin'
and do it now.

265
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,420
Right.

266
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,650
There's this dude.

267
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,820
He's **** intense.

268
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,120
İf you're, like,
thinking about him

269
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,360
or talking about him
or anything like that,

270
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,400
he's, like, right on top of you.

271
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,430
I was getting stuff on his wife.

272
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,770
She smells really bad.

273
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,100
I think living people
can smell her.

274
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,840
She does look like

275
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,440
a weird **** version
of a shadow person.

276
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,580
And the thing that she does is,
like, she'll be, like...

277
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,650
at their beds and watching.

278
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,830
So, Kristina, I understand
that you moved out

279
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,630
about 6 months ago.
- Yes.

280
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,760
Okay.

281
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,030
What was the reason for that?

282
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,830
Mostly because of the activity
in the house.

283
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,270
Now I know it's a tough subject
to talk about,

284
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,440
but I understand, um,
your fiancé...

285
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,210
Had passed away in the house.

286
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,310
Yes.
In the living room.

287
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,880
He was my best friend.

288
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,080
It's the hardest thing I've ever
had to go through in my life.

289
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,410
I can imagine.

290
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,920
I didn't think I was gonna
make it through it.

291
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,820
I know you've had experiences.
So tell me about some of 'em.

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,490
Um, one night I woke up
in the middle of the night,

293
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,960
and there was an old man
standing at the end of my bed

294
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,990
staring at me.

295
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,200
And he was just there
for, like, a couple seconds,

296
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,900
and then he disappeared.

297
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,060
So okay, anything else?

298
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,370
Bad anxiety attacks.
I mean, right now,

299
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,500
I- I'm havin'
a hard time breathing.

300
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,740
I- I just feel like somethin's
really heavy on my chest

301
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,740
and that my heart
goes outta rhythm.

302
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,440
And I start sweating
really bad.

303
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,810
- Okay.
- Sometimes I feel overwhelmed,

304
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,950
like I just wanna
break down crying.

305
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,880
And it's uncontrollable.

306
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,360
This dude would affect
living people,

307
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,130
make them feel a lotta stress.

308
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,700
If anybody would have
a problem with him living-wise,

309
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,470
it would be any female
in this house.

310
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,500
He probably does bad things
to women here.

311
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,540
Pain. Lots of pain.

312
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,910
My god.

313
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,350
I feel like I have
this pain in my back.

314
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,120
And I feel nauseous, too.

315
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,220
What the **** is happening?

316
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,610
Look, 39-year-old guys

317
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,210
just don't drop dead
of heart attacks.

318
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,010
There's gotta be more to it.

319
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,150
I reached out to Marcus' mom,
who's agreed to speak to me.

320
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,980
She says he did have
a condition,

321
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,350
and thinks his death
could have been prevented.

322
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
I know this is
a tough subject.

323
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,290
And I understand Marcus
did pass away in the house

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,630
I'm investigating.
- Yes.

325
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,360
Before we even get
to any of that stuff,

326
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,030
tell -- tell me about
your son.

327
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,400
This is a picture
of my son.

328
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,330
He's the oldest of five.

329
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,500
Okay.

330
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,170
Big, lovable guy.

331
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,670
He was like a big kid.
- Okay.

332
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,240
On the phone, you had mentioned
Marcus had a condition.

333
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,450
He had what is called
Atrial Septal Defect,

334
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,250
which is one of
the causes of his death.

335
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,350
It's actually
a hole in the wall

336
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,890
in between the two,
top chambers of the heart.

337
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,830
Did he take it serious?

338
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,900
He did not, you know,
take the best care of himself.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,570
He, smoked cigarettes
when he was younger.

340
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,200
And, he wasn't one
to work out or anything.

341
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,740
My son was a chef.

342
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,170
Chefs love food.
- Right.

343
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,110
They love rich foods.

344
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,780
When's the last time
you had seen him?

345
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,750
Last time I saw him
was Thanksgiving Day, 2011.

346
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,280
Okay. And how soon after that
did he pass?

347
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,620
He passed away
on December 19th.

348
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm assuming
they did an autopsy?

349
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,790
Yes. Here's a copy
of the autopsy report.

350
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,000
The autopsy found that he had
a grossly enlarged heart.

351
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,700
His heart basically
just gave up.

352
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Okay. Now you think
this could've been prevented.

353
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,040
Had he been going to a doctor
like he should've, yes.

354
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,310
I don't know how a parent could
lose a child. It's devastating.

355
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,110
Very devastating.

356
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,880
Lorie thinks he's still around
the house. How 'bout you?

357
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,780
I do.
He loved Lorie and Roy.

358
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,720
They were like
a second family to him.

359
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,260
I wouldn't be surprised at all
if he is around.

360
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,230
Especially, ya know,
looking after them.

361
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,470
There's, like, a dead guy
in here a lot.

362
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,710
He's a big guy.
He was stocky.

363
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,680
He smoked a lot.

364
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,980
He ate a lot of bad stuff.

365
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,220
I think he died
from a heart attack.

366
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,650
Very sudden, very quick.

367
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,920
He's very angry,
very angry about it.

368
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,890
He's trying to get out,
and he can't.

369
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,260
None of the dead people
can get outta here.

370
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,570
So far, I've got
a terminally ill client

371
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,010
whose family's being torn apart
by bizarre activity,

372
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,710
and a young man
who died of a heart attack

373
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,740
right inside their house.

374
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,750
But I need to see
if there's anything more.

375
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,080
Diggin' through old records,

376
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,320
I find a notorious gangster
named Cadillac Charlie.

377
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,720
In 1962, he and his son were
killed in a gruesome car bombing

378
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,560
only 600 feet
from Lorie's property.

379
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,890
Turns out, they were the victims
of a mob hit.

380
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,460
Now I'm not sure
how it's gonna help my case,

381
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,360
but I gotta check this one out.

382
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,240
So, Tom, I came across a mob hit
near my client's house.

383
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,670
I was even surprised to know
there was any mob in Youngstown.

384
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,110
Actually, Youngstown was
a pretty big mob city.

385
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,350
Now were car bombs like the one
near my client's property

386
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,080
a common way
to take people out?

387
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,620
In the --
in the 10 or 11 years before,

388
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,190
Cadillac Charlie
was blown up,

389
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,290
there were, like,
81 car bombings.

390
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,590
It drew the attention

391
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,760
of the Attorney General
of the United States --

392
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,290
Robert Kennedy.

393
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,030
And - Kennedy,
called J. Edgar Hoover

394
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,700
and got the FBI
involved in the case.

395
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,470
Something happened here.

396
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,440
And all these men
were in the process of dying.

397
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,150
I didn't see a battle or a war,
anything like that.

398
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,650
There's, like, piles and piles
and piles of dead bodies.

399
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,780
- How many?
- Like, hundreds.

400
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,890
These people, these men,
were **** up.

401
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,860
Like, some of 'em missin' a leg.

402
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,830
You know, they maybe got a shirt
and there's blood all over it.

403
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,500
Somehow, it reached all the way
to Washington, DC.

404
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,470
I saw a big, round table

405
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,010
with seven or eight politicians

406
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,110
discussing men dying here.

407
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,810
And it was a big deal.

408
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,050
Cadillac Charlie.

409
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,020
This guy sounds like
a made guy, a wise guy.

410
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,480
What do we know
about him?

411
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,350
He's
a Sicilian immigrant.

412
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,520
Came to the United States
in 1921.

413
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,660
This is a picture here
of, of Charlie.

414
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,430
Not much is known about him
the first 10 or 15 years

415
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,600
he's in the country.

416
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,460
And then a few years later,
in, in 1940,

417
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,000
he first shows up
in Youngstown,

418
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,130
gets involved with

419
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
the organized crime figures
in town.

420
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,440
Um, he buys a pool hall,

421
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,670
slash lottery house.

422
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,810
He rose pretty fast.

423
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,580
And,
by the time, -

424
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,810
the early '50s rolled around,
he was --

425
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,580
he was the man
in Youngstown.

426
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,850
So, Tom, I know the house
he lived in

427
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,580
is a pretty suburban area,

428
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,650
by my client's house.

429
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,190
Um, I assume
he had a family.

430
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah, he did.

431
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,690
He lived there
with his second wife.

432
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,430
She was about 14 years younger
than he was.

433
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,900
He had,
four kids total.

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,930
Okay. So how did this whole
car bombing go down?

435
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,070
Well, the bombing and --
and the murder occurred,

436
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,340
the day after Thanksgiving,
November 23rd, 1962.

437
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,810
Okay.
It's Friday morning.

438
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,910
Charlie's kids
got football practice.

439
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,440
Okay.
Charlie and Tommy
get in the car,

440
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,780
turns the ignition to the car
and ka-boom, the -- the --

441
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,380
the whole --
the whole car blows up.

442
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,920
The garage blows up.
He's blown --

443
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,950
Him and his son
are both blown to bits.

444
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,650
Here's a photo of,
of his son.

445
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,090
His 11-year-old son that was,
killed in the, um,

446
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,490
the car bombing.

447
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,060
Jeez.

448
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,660
Any idea why this guy was
the victim of a mob hit?

449
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,500
Well, there was a couple
of, of --

450
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,830
of theories runnin' around.

451
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,530
One of 'em was that he --
he was deeply in debt.

452
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,770
But nobody really knows
for sure.

453
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,740
Nobody's ever collared
for this or arrested?

454
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,040
No one was every arrested.

455
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,880
Okay.

456
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,850
I don't like this guy.

457
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,450
The angry man
is pulling me back upstairs,

458
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,420
and he's bragging
about all the terrible things

459
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,650
he did in life.

460
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,720
He says he<i> owned</i> men
or laborers.

461
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,530
He's wearing, like, a suit.

462
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,660
I guess he owned...businesses?

463
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,530
I see, like,
two small businesses.

464
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,630
And he's definitely
from back east.

465
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,370
And he moved here.

466
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,770
Maybe he<i> was</i> in prison.

467
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,670
I see a fire,
and I see him kind of burnt.

468
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,180
He's, like, charred.

469
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,310
He died,
and was murdered apparently.

470
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,120
And he's very
pissed off about it.

471
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,520
He feels like it was, you know,
he didn't deserve it.

472
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,890
He says, "I didn't deserve it.

473
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,190
I didn't deserve it."

474
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,130
He says it wasn't an accident.

475
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,060
It was deliberate.

481
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
During my research,
a former owner

482
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,210
of my client's property
caught my attention.

483
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,770
So I had a local genealogist

484
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,010
look into this guy,
Paul Wick, for me.

485
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,110
She just called me back
and said this guy's story

486
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,320
is filled with tragedy,
heartbreak, and bankruptcy.

487
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,990
So, Kimberly, why did you want
to come here to talk?

488
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,690
Because in its better days,

489
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,330
this was a mill a lot like
what Paul Wick ran.

490
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,830
I figured this would be
a good place

491
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,470
to tell you his story.

492
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,900
Okay.

493
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,570
So how does Paul wind up
with my client's property?

494
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,440
When he was 14 years old,

495
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,440
Daddy handed him, basically,
117 acres.

496
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,580
Part of that is where
your client's house sits.

497
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Here is a picture of him
right here.

498
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,280
All right.
So Paul, does he get married?

499
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,050
Does he stay single?
What's his story?

500
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,590
He does get married
when he's 22 years old.

501
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,190
His wife is named
Susan Bull.

502
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,760
And here is her picture.

503
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,860
They got married in 1846
and the raised six kids.

504
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,270
Now, Kimberly,
you mentioned on the phone

505
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,830
that this guy
suffered from heartbreak,

506
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,300
tragedy, and bankruptcy.

507
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,870
Let's start with heartbreak.
What happened?

508
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,170
1882, Susan unexpectedly died
of heart disease...

509
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,340
Okay.

510
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,540
...leaving him to raise
six kids.

511
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,510
Okay, so let's move on
to the tragedy.

512
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,950
Well, one of Paul's holdings
was an iron mill.

513
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,490
Would've been a lot like this
in its better day.

514
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,190
Paul's iron mill
had 10 boilers.
Okay.

515
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,520
August 28th, 1872,

516
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,260
nine of the 10 boilers
exploded.

517
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,060
There were three fatalities.

518
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,730
A one-ton piece
of one of the boilers

519
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,770
flew a quarter of a mile away

520
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,500
and fell into a house,

521
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,240
killing a mother
and a 9-month-old son.

522
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,380
Jeez.

523
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,980
All right,
now these explosions,

524
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,850
is that what leads to
his bankruptcy?

525
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,310
Partially.

526
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,720
But back in 1883, Youngstown
was going through a depression,

527
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,050
especially
in the iron industry.

528
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,220
There were signs,
but he ignored 'em.

529
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,090
For the next 7 years,
he ties things up in court.

530
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,030
Ten days after the final
court hearing, Paul Wick dies.

531
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,400
He was a broken man.

532
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,270
Heartache, tragedy,
and bankruptcy.

533
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,210
You weren't kidding.
It followed him
his entire life.

534
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,450
What this thing is,

535
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,920
is a culmination

536
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,520
of all the negativity

537
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,320
that has been within
these walls.

538
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,830
Even though the angry dead man

539
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,330
poses a serious threat to
the living women in the house,

540
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,830
I'm most concerned about
this thing in the dining room.

541
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,940
It's absorbed living energy
from living people.

542
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,570
Horrible things
that it's absorbed.

543
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,610
It's collected
into this big blob.

544
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,680
What happens if it were
to continue to -- to get bigger?

545
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,320
It'll then become intertwined
with the house...

546
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,360
to the point where it'll just
meld within the walls.

547
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,860
And then it'll become one
with the house, the structure.

548
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,900
And the structure is actually
like a living organism.

549
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,140
And then, it does form
a consciousness over time.

550
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,110
And then it can project
entities, to do harm.

551
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,780
So it could kill them.

552
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,160
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

553
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,160
but two stood out the most.

554
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,990
First, the angry man.

555
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,800
He was, I believe,
in his 40s.

556
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,100
Like, stocky.

557
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
A very, like, thick neck.

558
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,110
Next, I described the thing
growing in the dining room.

559
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,880
It's this big, black,

560
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,180
undulating mass.

561
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,420
And it looked like it was
made out of tar.

562
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,720
And it had, like, veins.

563
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,590
Amy,
is this what you saw?

564
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,500
Yes, that's who I saw.

565
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,570
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

566
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,870
we're ready
to reveal our findings

567
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,110
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

568
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,110
Amy, I want you to meet
Lorie and her husband Roy.

569
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,010
There is no easy way
to say this,

570
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,050
but Lorie doesn't have
much time left.

571
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,720
She's been diagnosed
with stage IV cancer,

572
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,360
and the doctors give her
about 2 months to live.

573
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,690
Now the activity here
is pretty bad.

574
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,390
And Lorie's dying wish

575
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,060
is to know her family's gonna
be okay once she's gone.

576
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,770
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys,

577
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,940
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

578
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,470
There's something very unusual
about this particular area.

579
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,540
What I saw was that
the dead can't move on.

580
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,850
They're trapped.

581
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,880
And I saw a wall
surrounding this property.

582
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,690
When I walked into the house,
I went into the master bedroom,

583
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,960
and I saw a dead man
in there.

584
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,660
Um, he was
extremely stressed out.

585
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,470
This was very recent,
within the last 10 years.

586
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,300
I got that he was
a big, stocky guy

587
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
who did a lotta hard work.

588
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,670
I got that he was
unfortunately unhealthy,

589
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,740
and smoked and ate
a lot of bad food.

590
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,640
And that he died
very suddenly,

591
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,380
from a heart attack.

592
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,820
And he's extremely upset
about that as well.

593
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,650
We kinda think we know
this might be, right?

594
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,920
Yeah.

595
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,350
Lorie's daughter, Kristina,
was living here

596
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,920
with her fiancé Marcus,
for about 2 months.

597
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,830
I got a picture of Marcus here
with Kristina and their dogs.

598
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,330
Marcus was born
with a Atrial Septal Defect.

599
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,070
Despite that, he did lead
an unhealthy lifestyle.

600
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,010
He had smoked.
He ate a lotta rich foods.

601
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,640
He was a chef.

602
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,940
Now, on December 19th, 2011,

603
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,350
he was sitting right here
in this room with Kristina,

604
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,220
um, when his heart stopped.

605
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,420
He was only 39 years old.

606
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,960
Now does this photo look like
the person you ran into?

607
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,790
I would say yes.

608
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
Tell Amy the story
about the bruise around the arm.

609
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,660
I was upstairs.

610
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,170
I was
repacking Marcus' things,

611
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,240
and arms grabbed me.

612
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,970
And I began to burn.

613
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,240
It hurt so badly.

614
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,310
And I'm like, "No!"

615
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,680
And I thought it was Marcus
the minute it happened.

616
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,480
I don't get the impression
that he --

617
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,120
that he would harm anyone.

618
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,050
No, I don't either.

619
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,560
I don't think he wanted
his stuff to leave.

620
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,390
I loved him.

621
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,900
The next people that I met,

622
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,870
when they were alive,
they were a couple.

623
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,040
The wife is
an emotional wreck.

624
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,210
Extremely depressed.

625
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,640
I think that
the living would --

626
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,880
would associate her
with, like, a shadow person,

627
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,950
um, because she is
all black.

628
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,850
And she likes to watch
people in the beds.

629
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,250
The other thing is she doesn't,
smell very good.

630
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,560
Now you see shadows.

631
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,960
Yeah. I see shadows,

632
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,160
mostly when I'm sittin' here
watchin' TV.

633
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,130
And I'll see a shadow...

634
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,160
real fast go by the TV.

635
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,670
- Okay.
- You mentioned a smell, right?

636
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,240
Yeah.

637
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,910
All the time.
It's, like, walkin' past death.

638
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,010
Her husband is the one
I'm more concerned about.

639
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,210
He was
an<i> extremely</i> angry man.

640
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,220
I felt like he was insane.

641
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,950
He goes all over the house.

642
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,620
He has major issues
with women.

643
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,230
He gets really pissy if somebody
starts talking about him.

644
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,330
And he'll get right up on
that person,

645
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,560
like, right in their space.

646
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,370
This'll make a living person
very stressed out.

647
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,840
Um, I think that living people
might be able to see him.

648
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,210
Lorie got
physically attacked by --

649
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,740
There's this horn-shaped
kind of figurine statue thing

650
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,910
with elephants on it.

651
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,910
I was in bed
and I was sleeping.

652
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,420
And it was low enough

653
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,850
that it shoulda just
fallen on my chest.

654
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,890
But it bashed me
in the head.

655
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,290
And I still have pain.

656
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,630
Yeah. He's a bully.

657
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,330
The other thing is anxiety
throughout the house.

658
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,930
Everybody has anxiety attacks.

659
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm actually dizzy,
like I could pass out.

660
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't know why.

661
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,140
This house...

662
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,480
Yeah.

663
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,750
You get anything on this guy,
like who he was?

664
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,180
I got that
he'd been in prison.

665
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,420
I got that he was from back east
and that he moved here.

666
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,750
I got that he owned a couple
of small businesses.

667
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,660
I got that he was murdered.

668
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,490
Um, and he feels
like he did not deserve it.

669
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,130
And I got constantly,
him in fire.

670
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,430
Half of his face is, like,
burnt, singed.

671
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Definitely reminds me
of somebody

672
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,610
who came up in my research.

673
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,510
One of the most
notorious gangsters

674
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,140
in Youngstown
lived about 600 feet from here.

675
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,380
His name
was Charles Cavallaro.

676
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,510
He went by the name
of Cadillac Charlie.

677
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,250
Charlie was
a Sicilian immigrant,

678
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,850
came to the US in 1921.

679
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,050
He lived in New York City.
You said the east coast.

680
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,120
He was in the mob.
He was probably a made guy.

681
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,860
And we know he got arrested
a few times.

682
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,690
Now in 1940,
he moved to Youngstown.

683
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,400
You said something about fire
and him saying he was murdered.

684
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,300
That's about as spot-on
as it gets.

685
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
On November 23rd, 1962,

686
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,170
he was gonna take the kids
to football practice.

687
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,610
Charlie turned on the car,
and boom, it exploded.

688
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,910
****.

689
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,880
The car bomb killed him

690
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,410
and his 11-year-old son
Tommy instantly.

691
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,680
Now I have pictures

692
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,780
of Cadillac Charlie.

693
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,790
And his son.

694
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,920
And this is car
after the explosion.

695
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,500
The crime was never solved.

696
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
Definitely a mob hit.

697
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,570
My god.

698
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,700
Is that who you think
you saw?

699
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,470
I had a sketch done
of him.

700
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,180
-100% this is him.
- Absolutely.

701
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,610
You tell me if you think
that's him or not.

702
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,850
Yeah.

703
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,350
My.

704
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,750
Yep.

705
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,050
Yeah.

706
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,550
Why would he be here, though?

707
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,490
'Cause there's somethin' else
that's here.

708
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,570
The thing that I'm most
concerned about

709
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,500
is the thing
in the dining room.

710
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,900
It's, like, a big mass.

711
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,740
A big blob.

712
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,140
It has, like veins on it.

713
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,940
And it's, like,
always pulsating.

714
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,280
Like a heart.

715
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,610
This has a very large impact

716
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,080
on anybody in this house.

717
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,880
It feeds on negativity,

718
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:00,590
and that's how
it gains power and grows.

719
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,660
And I saw one living person
being consumed,

720
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,030
by this thing
on an energetic level.

721
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,400
This living person
would feel like

722
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,570
they were losing themselves,

723
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,010
like they were losing
their personality

724
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,270
and aspects of their being.

725
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,880
This person could be sick
and/or dying.

726
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,080
We talkin' about Lorie here?

727
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,490
Sounds like it.

728
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,190
Yeah.

729
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,320
I feel like I'm here
and not here.

730
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,960
And here and not here.

731
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,500
I was getting

732
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,170
that the living would experience
a lot of nightmares.

733
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,840
And also, visions.

734
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,740
One of the things
that I was shown

735
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,210
was somebody
watching someone cooking.

736
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,350
And all of a sudden, they get
this, like, vision of them,

737
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,110
like, picking up a knife

738
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,980
and walking up
behind the person.

739
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,890
It can manipulate the living
to harm one another.

740
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,760
When I'm in the kitchen,

741
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,360
when I go toward
the sharp knives,

742
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,960
something in my head
tells me,

743
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,570
"Slit your wrists. It'll be
okay. It'll be over."

744
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:23,270
But it's, like, somebody talking
<i>to</i> me, not in my own brain.

745
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,540
Now it makes sense.

746
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,040
Yeah.

747
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,040
You wanted to kill
the family dog, too.

748
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,180
Yeah. Soon as I opened
the cage to let her out.

749
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,280
The dog knew it wasn't me
because that dog ran from me,

750
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,250
and she don't never run from me.

751
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,550
It's a good thing she did

752
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,690
'cause if I'd have caught her,
I'd have killed her.

753
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,030
I go outside and shake my head,
and I'm like, "Get<i> outta</i> me!"

754
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,630
And it goes away.

755
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,930
The last time it happened,
I punched a hole in the wall.

756
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,500
And I would never
do anything like that.

757
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,440
- Weren't we talkin' about this?
- Yeah.

758
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,040
That we hoped it wasn't him,

759
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,410
and it had somethin'
to do with the house.

760
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,940
- Right.
- You know it's not him.

761
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,440
Yeah.

762
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,510
Now what did this thing
look like?

763
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,350
I had a sketch done.

764
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,760
This looks like somethin'
out of a science fiction movie

765
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,190
or somethin'.

766
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,030
Whoa.

767
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,300
And it grows?

768
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,870
Yes.

769
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,300
A long time ago,

770
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,070
it first started.

771
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,670
Like a seed.

772
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,240
And everything negative
that's happened

773
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,550
over these many, many years
has fed it.

774
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,650
And it's grown bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger

775
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,450
to this now.

776
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,520
It is like a little animal.

777
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,430
And as an animal,
what do they want?

778
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,190
They want food.

779
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,930
And they wanna be strong,
they wanna survive.

780
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,000
The only way it's gonna do
that is by taking living people.

781
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,670
Going after people

782
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,810
who are vulnerable
that it can absorb.

783
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,380
So this thing, every time
they fight, it gets stronger.

784
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,610
Yes.

785
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,680
Every time Roy has his rage,
it gets stronger.

786
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,380
Yeah.

787
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,590
So if this goes unchecked,

788
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,520
what happens?

789
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,890
Well, I go that
it'll keep growing.

790
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,390
And then eventually,

791
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,460
it would mesh and become
part of the house.

792
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,000
And basically the house
would then be alive,

793
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
essentially.

794
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,000
Can anybody live in a house
like that?

795
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,170
No. Mnh-mnh. No.

796
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,210
I was right.

797
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,620
This house
is going to kill me.

798
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,180
Well, Lorie,
I gotta tell you,

799
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,710
you're one of the strongest
people I've ever met.

800
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,480
Amy, listen, I don't wanna put
pressure on you,

801
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,250
but I really hope you can
come up with something for Lorie

802
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,950
so she can live out
her final days in peace.

803
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,390
For years,
this thing has fed

804
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,730
and it has
only grown stronger,

805
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,100
to the point,

806
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,270
that I don't think
any living thing

807
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,440
should be near this thing.

808
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,010
What does this mean?
They gotta move?

809
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,780
The only way that this thing
in this area could be cleansed

810
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,820
is if many mediums,

811
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,550
many holy people

812
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,150
came over months and months

813
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,420
and dedicated
many days, hours,

814
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,460
to eradicating first
the negative dead,

815
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,700
and then attacking this thing
at its source.

816
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,170
The thing of it is,
we leave this thing here,

817
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,610
what's gonna happen?

818
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,880
What I'm honestly hoping

819
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,680
is that this area
will be leveled.

820
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,920
It needs to be leveled.

821
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,460
It's all right, hon.
It's just a house.

822
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,600
Right.

823
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,470
We can get a house.
That's no big deal.

824
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,870
It'll be all right.
It'll be okay.

825
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,210
Well, I guess we better hurry up
'cause I'm not doin' too good.

826
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,350
I know, baby. I know.

827
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,980
Once these guys move,

828
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,550
will she start to feel
a little bit better?

829
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,320
I hope so.

830
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,160
It can't come with me,
can it?

831
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,460
No.

832
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,930
Now will Roy's rage go away
once he's...

833
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,600
Yeah, that'll --
You'll change dramatically.

834
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,270
I hope so.

835
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,670
Listen, you guys
may have lost a home,

836
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,770
but now you got
each other again.

837
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,670
Right?

838
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,540
I know the answers
you were lookin' for

839
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
wasn't the ones you got.

840
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,010
No.

841
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,610
But you got answers.

842
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,680
We will be
outta this house quick.

843
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,450
We've had enough.

844
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,730
I wish I had better news
for Lorie and Roy,

845
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,900
but leaving this house
is their best option.

846
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,930
If they do that, things
should improve between them,

847
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,930
and Lorie can live
her remaining days in peace.
