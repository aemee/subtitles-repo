1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:13,412
I don't feel okay here.

2
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,948
I feel like I wanna run.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,083
We've had customers
walk in the door

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,985
and stop dead
in their tracks.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,456
Those things are here.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,693
I saw several dead people
standing amongst the diners.

7
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,029
To me, they feel like a threat.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,269
I am extremely creeped out.

9
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,405
I just hear death.

10
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,106
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,741
God.

12
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,743
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,844
I see dead people.

14
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,112
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,881
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,650
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

17
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,051
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,586
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

19
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,723
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,725
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

21
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,293
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,861
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,596
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,098
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,301
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,469
They're everywhere.

27
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,870
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,939
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

29
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,775
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,777
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,012
...until the very end...

32
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,680
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

33
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,549
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,651
That's it.

35
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,919
...or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,088
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

37
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,575
I'm in Sedona, Arizona,
about 2 hours from Phoenix.

38
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,243
We got called in
by a guy named Joe.

39
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,512
Now, he moved out here
from the East Coast

40
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,315
and opened up a restaurant
to live the good life.

41
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,617
Problem is,
the activity's so bad,

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,186
his employees and customers
are scared to death.

43
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,821
And he says, if we can't fix it,

44
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,990
he may lose
his entire life savings.

45
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,566
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area of anything

46
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,269
that might influence
her findings.

47
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,105
This is a large space
with a lot of historical items

48
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,876
and signs that need
to be covered.

49
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,944
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

50
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,947
for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,430
Agh, I really
don't like it here.

52
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,166
I feel really, really,
very sick.

53
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,337
A lot of anxiety.

54
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,340
And stress.

55
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,311
I think that, if the living
spent enough time here,

56
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,047
you know, they would
develop things like ulcers

57
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,582
or stomach problems.

58
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:11,423
I'm getting feelings
of being abandoned, unwanted.

59
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,792
I don't feel very good here.

60
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,201
So, Joe, when we spoke
on the phone,

61
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,903
you sounded really
concerned about things.

62
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,705
What's goin' on?

63
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,940
Well, there's been
a lot of reports,

64
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,409
by both my employees
and customers,

65
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,811
of things happening here
in the restaurant.

66
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,246
Okay, so that's costin'
you business.

67
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,982
It is, indeed,
but the most important

68
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,618
concern, in my mind, is
the safety of my guests,

69
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,987
my customers,
and my employees.

70
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,855
Okay. How long have you
owned the building?

71
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,090
13 years.

72
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,726
Okay. When did you start
havin' experiences?

73
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,295
I haven't had
any experiences.

74
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,863
I haven't had any
experiences here,

75
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,565
or anywhere else
in my life.

76
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,967
Okay. Not to be rude,

77
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,234
but what the hell
am I doin' here, then?

78
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,603
I believe
it's really happening.

79
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,770
I certainly
did not believe it

80
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,839
in the beginning,
as a skeptic,

81
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,442
but we've had customers
walk in the door

82
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,210
and stop dead
in their tracks.

83
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,813
These are real people
- Right.

84
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:10,582
that are having
genuine experiences.

85
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,818
All right. Joe, I know
you've had no experiences,

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,786
but what's been
reported to you?

87
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,155
Things moving
on their own.

88
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,758
Shadow figures
in different forms.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,393
Full-body apparitions.

90
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,861
And also
mood changes.

91
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,429
With all this concern
you have,

92
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,697
why don't you just
sell the place?

93
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,199
I'm too invested
in the place.

94
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,734
It's a gorgeous
building.

95
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,169
I've put many years

96
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,740
in improving it
and in restoring it.

97
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,875
Let me show you a photo

98
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:41,113
of what the facility
used to look like.

99
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,814
So, Joe, this must've
cost a pretty penny,

100
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,416
for you to restore all this.

101
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,185
It did. It cost me
my life savings.

102
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,353
Okay.

103
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,222
Sometimes, my partner,

104
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,524
she'll tell a client that
it's not safe to stay here.

105
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,226
How would you take
that information?

106
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,395
I don't know how
I would deal with that.

107
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,296
That would be
devastating news for me.

108
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,979
A lot of the things that
are here are not welcoming.

109
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,581
Everything in this room,
I despise.

110
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,951
I don't like the flooring.
I don't like this bar.

111
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:24,423
It adds too much chaos
to the environment.

112
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:31,163
There's not many places where
you can go here and feel okay.

113
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,006
I think that, for people
who are slightly sensitive,

114
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,643
to be here would be
a **** nightmare.

115
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,578
I don't think they would last
too long, honestly.

116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,914
I think it would be
a real struggle.

117
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:53,618
I think they would see
a lot of stuff all the time.

118
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,855
I think they would feel
physically horrendous.

119
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,391
I don't wanna ****
be here right now.

120
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,693
I- I don't feel okay
here.

121
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,962
I feel like I wanna run.

122
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,003
So, Karyn, I was talkin' to Joe

123
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,572
and he was tellin' me
that you guys are partners

124
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,040
and he's concerned
for the employees,

125
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,908
as well as the customers
that come here.

126
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,543
You agree with him?

127
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,112
Yes, I do agree with him.

128
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:24,216
My concern is that,
customers and employees,

129
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,585
that they are not
fearful to be here

130
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,787
and/or in
any type of danger.

131
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,689
So I know Joe's never
had an experience before.

132
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,224
What about you?

133
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,092
Well, I did have one

134
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,861
back here,
with one of my cooks.

135
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,396
Okay.
- And a cup like this

136
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,232
flew off
of that middle shelf

137
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,867
toward us,
at the steam table.

138
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,702
It bounced off
and broke on the floor.

139
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,237
And nobody else was
in the kitchen at the time?

140
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,439
- No.
- And nothin's gonna fall

141
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,842
and fly all the way across,
at least 5-, 6-, 7-feet span.

142
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,677
No. Not with the laws
of physics.

143
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,179
Doesn't work that way.

144
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,081
Well, it sounds like you had
a close call back here.

145
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,249
That coulda been a knife

146
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,650
and you could've been
seriously hurt.

147
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,355
Boy.

148
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,491
There's so many accidents here.

149
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,195
It's abnormal.
It's not normal.

150
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,130
It's freaking people out.

151
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,966
People falling down, burn.

152
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,770
You know, stupid ****
that's so constant,

153
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,139
over and over and over again.

154
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,109
Yeah, it's bad. You know,
it's not good, you know?

155
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,913
It's a lot, a lot.

156
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,415
So, have you had
any other experiences?

157
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,885
Yes, I did, in the front
fine-dining room.

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,222
Something brushed up
against the back of me.

159
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,058
Did you get the sense it
might've been a man or a woman?

160
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,527
No. I didn't get a sense
of an actual gender.

161
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,764
I felt like it --
it was almost

162
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,499
as if it was just
checking me out.

163
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,267
All right, was the door open,
like maybe the wind?

164
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,404
Nothing.
No staff. No one.

165
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,839
what are you hopin' to get

166
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,007
outta this investigation?
- I'm concerned for

167
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,243
the customers
and employees.

168
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,045
I want them
to feel safe.

169
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,014
We really want you guys
to figure out

170
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,784
what it is that's here
and get rid of it.

171
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,855
What is that?

172
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,094
There's a dog.

173
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,796
But it's not a good dog.

174
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,831
It's a bad dog!

175
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,003
And I hear this is what they
need to be concerned about.

176
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,240
They all feel things
brushing against them.

177
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,408
This is this animal.

178
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,378
It causes bad things to happen.

179
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,280
Is it what's doin'
the stuff in here?

180
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,548
Yes.

181
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:43,221
I do think it's a possibility
that, other than just

182
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:47,592
causing accidents
for living people here,

183
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,762
I think that,
if the living have

184
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,165
some kind of interaction
with the dog,

185
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,836
they are possibly,
somehow, marked.

186
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,773
To die.

187
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,410
So, Deborah, I understand that
you're the office manager here.

188
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:26,848
Yes. And I'm a healer,
a psychic, and a medium.

189
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,550
Have you had
any experiences?

190
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,285
Well, we had
a stretch of time here

191
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:35,390
where people
were argumentative,

192
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,792
irritable, depressed.

193
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,928
How do you know
that this just wasn't

194
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,863
employees bein'
in a bad mood?

195
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,833
Well, it went on for
such an extended period

196
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,736
and seemed to involve
so many different people,

197
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:48,937
even people
who are normally,

198
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,739
you know, even-keeled.

199
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:54,476
Whether that's paranormal
or not, I don't know.

200
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,844
Anything else?

201
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,045
Yes, actually.

202
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,447
I was walking through
the front dining room

203
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,816
Okay.
- and I saw a man sitting

204
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,251
at a table.

205
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:06,187
I turned back around
to introduce myself

206
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,288
and there was
no one there.

207
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,224
Can you describe him for me?

208
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,792
A little bit tall.

209
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,627
The hair
was a little long,

210
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,763
parted in the middle,
with wings.

211
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:17,799
I could feel
his intense ownership,

212
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:20,068
like he was looking
over the place

213
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,703
or taking care of it.

214
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,772
Okay. So now, if you saw
a sketch or a photo,

215
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,507
would you be able
to identify him?

216
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,909
Well, yes.
I already have.

217
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,245
And, actually the
photograph's over there.

218
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,515
Who is this guy?

219
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:36,351
He's Henry Frank Gibson,
the former owner.

220
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,819
That photo
is the guy you saw?

221
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:40,021
Yes. And I had not
seen that photograph

222
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:43,124
until several days after
I had seen the apparition.

223
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,232
I'm seeing this larger male.

224
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,068
He's in his 50s.

225
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,837
His hair, a little longer,
a little.

226
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,474
It feels like he had a lot
to do with this place.

227
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,944
Feels like a...owner.

228
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:05,814
Something weird is going on
with the dead here.

229
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,582
There just seems to be an issue

230
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:13,254
with the dead finding rest
in this specific area.

231
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,859
The living are sensitive
and they will feel their deaths

232
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:22,030
and they might not understand
what they're feeling.

233
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:27,769
They would feel the sense
of dying, the dying process.

234
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,972
I think they would also feel

235
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,942
fear and sadness and anxious.

236
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,582
So, Jane, I understand
that you work here.

237
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,450
Yeah, for 5 years.

238
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,985
Any experiences
you could tell me about?

239
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:47,155
Well, yes.
When I was hosting,

240
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:51,893
I sat four lovely ladies
at this very table

241
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,595
and then I went
to the kitchen

242
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:56,197
and came back and there
were only three,

243
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,300
so I said, "Shall I wait
for the fourth one?"

244
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,969
and they said, "No.

245
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,204
There's only three
of us here."

246
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,840
You sure that a fourth person
didn't come in right behind 'em

247
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,475
and they were just
a single customer?

248
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,112
I<i> knew.</i> I<i> knew</i>
there were four ladies.

249
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,314
All right. So anything else?

250
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,116
Entering the bar,
one night,

251
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:19,020
an enormous, pitch-black,
triangular cape

252
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:23,057
came flyin' at me from
the uppermost ceiling,

253
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,059
down, straight at me,

254
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,530
to the point where
I physically jumped.

255
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,931
And then it was gone.

256
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,500
Did it look like it was
intentionally going at you?

257
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,003
It did, sir,
and it was frightening.

258
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:44,312
There are a group of beings

259
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:53,888
out here
and they are like smoke.

260
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,623
They're not solid.

261
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,192
You can see through them.

262
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,829
And their eyes are lights.

263
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,866
They made me feel uncomfortable.

264
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,677
What?

265
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,645
Just those things are here.

266
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,081
- The smoky things?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,950
How many of these
things are there?

268
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,018
Four or five,
I'm thinkin'.

269
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,189
Do you know what
these things are?

270
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,392
I'm leaning towards
some kind of elementals.

271
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,362
Elementals are entities
created by nature.

272
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:37,098
They are not
necessarily dangerous.

273
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,399
But these are.

274
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,034
To me, they feel
like a threat.

275
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,678
Heather, I understand
that you used to work here.

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,748
Yes, I did.
I was a hostess, server.

277
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,950
So, I assume you've had
experiences, then.

278
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,552
Yes.
- Okay. Can you take me

279
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:58,886
through some of 'em?

280
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,955
I did feel some anxiety,

281
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,424
just a tightness,
being in here.

282
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,561
I can hear and feel
energies around me.

283
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:09,530
I'm very sensitive
if there's another being,

284
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:13,901
apparition, or energy.

285
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,536
Okay.
So, anything else?

286
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:18,373
I was in the bar area,
carrying trays,

287
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,310
and telling a gentlemen,
"Excuse me,"

288
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:25,146
standing in my way,
wearing a plaid shirt.

289
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,615
And I look.
There's nobody there.

290
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,651
Okay. So can you
describe that person?

291
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:33,021
Gruffy,
rough-looking, dirty.

292
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,689
Have you seen him again
since that time?

293
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:37,091
Yes.
In the kitchen area.

294
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,593
I don't know,
'cause it's being New Age,

295
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,194
or this is a woo-woo
type of town,

296
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:43,865
but everybody seems to take
what's goin' on here kinda

297
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:47,902
"We got ghosts, they throw
things, no big deal."

298
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,971
This is what
goes on here.

299
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,041
Okay.
So, anything else?

300
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,143
When I would go and serve
in the dining room,

301
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,011
I saw several
dead people

302
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,013
standing
amongst the diners.

303
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,848
How many people
you talkin'?

304
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,784
5 to 12.

305
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,285
How many times
has this happened?

306
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,387
A few times, serving
in the dining room.

307
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,689
I would almost
drop my tray,

308
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,823
trying to move
around someone,

309
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,024
thinking
that they're there,

310
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,526
and then, all of a sudden,
they're gone.

311
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:14,429
I- It made me
pretty uncomfortable,

312
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,264
to encounter
something like that.

313
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:27,008
I am extremely
creeped out.

314
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,309
What's happening?

315
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:33,848
Anybody who's died here
is set up like mannequins.

316
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,617
There's people
in these chairs.

317
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,757
But they're dead.

318
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,026
It looks like their
physical bodies are here

319
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,529
and their soul is stuck
in their physical body

320
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:53,034
and they've been like
propped up like mannequins.

321
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:59,440
They can't talk or move.

322
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:02,110
I think the living
would maybe see this.

323
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,012
This is
cree-ee-py.

324
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,381
I don't like it.

325
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,972
Joe didn't know much history
about his restaurant,

326
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,273
so I made some calls

327
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,209
and, it turns out, a guy
named George Nelson got shot

328
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,613
and ended up dyin' in his
parking lot back in 1957.

329
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,015
I managed to track down
the victim's nephew,

330
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,284
who says, even though
this is still an open case,

331
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,620
he's got his own theory
about what actually happened.

332
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:49,064
So, Dan, before we get
to your uncle's tragic death,

333
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,865
what can you
tell me about him?

334
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,534
Here's a picture of him,
probably from when

335
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:54,202
he was a senior
in high school.

336
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:56,137
He was just friendly,
nice.

337
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,772
Not an enemy
in the world.

338
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,441
All right, Dan,
so, if you can,

339
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:00,975
take me through the night
of the murder. What happened?

340
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:04,346
It happened
May 25, 1957,

341
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:05,847
by the bar that
you're investigating.

342
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,283
Rainbow's End was what
it was called back then.

343
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,251
My uncle was with a couple
of his friends,

344
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,053
a couple of his buddies,
then there was

345
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,589
two younger girls
that they had picked up.

346
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:16,891
They all piled
in the car.

347
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,027
My uncle was in the
passenger seat up front.

348
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,628
Okay.
- And one of his friends

349
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,497
was driving and then
the other guy was

350
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,599
in the backseat,
between the two girls.

351
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,101
One thing you should know
is the friend

352
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:27,402
who was driving
was married

353
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,605
and the guy who was in the
back had a girlfriend.

354
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:34,409
They'd just left
Rainbow's End

355
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,144
and they passed by a car

356
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,912
that was sittin' on the
side of the road.

357
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,781
All of a sudden,
the car pulls up bes--

358
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,416
behind 'em,
started following.

359
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:43,385
George turned around
to the guy in the backseat

360
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,320
and said,
"You'd better duck down,

361
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,855
'cause your girlfriend's
followin' us."

362
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,623
So your uncle
recognized the car?

363
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,393
Yes. All of a sudden,
boom! Gunshot.

364
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:53,895
The back window shattered.
It hit my uncle in the head.

365
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:57,365
There's brains everywhere,
total chaos.

366
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,534
Witnesses told me that
they saw my uncle

367
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,270
"gurgling" on the
floorboards of the car,

368
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,805
so, even though his brains
were blown apart,

369
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,473
he was still alive.

370
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:06,674
You know, his body
was still alive.

371
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:08,510
He was breathing.
And they turned around

372
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:11,112
and went back
to Rainbow's End,

373
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:14,115
but, by then, it was
too late. He was dead.

374
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,683
I have a copy of

375
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,652
my uncle's death
certificate right here.

376
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:23,358
So do you think
this girl intended

377
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,160
to kill somebody
in that car?

378
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,694
I think she was actually
just trying to scare them

379
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:29,931
and my uncle died
because of it.

380
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,667
So, officially,
George Nelson's murder

381
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,502
is unsolved, to this day.

382
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,610
There's some kind of
gunfight.

383
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,380
I feel like somebody
got shot with a shotgun.

384
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:50,952
It's a guy and he's young.

385
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:56,224
It takes him a while to die.

386
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,332
It hurts.
It horribly hurts.

387
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,935
It hurts so **** bad.

388
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,214
So far, I've got
a restaurant owner scared

389
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:22,584
for the safety of his employees
and guests, on a property

390
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:25,320
where a man died of a gunshot
wound to the head.

391
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:27,489
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

392
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:30,091
Searchin' through old records,
I find an article

393
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,094
about a local man
who died in 2006.

394
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:34,829
Turns out, he was run over
by a car

395
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,531
right outside
my client's property.

396
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,769
I'm on my way to meet
with the county sheriff,

397
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:44,772
who says the victim used to be
a regular at Joe's restaurant.

398
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:53,915
So, this guy that got killed

399
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,583
right outside
my client's restaurant,

400
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,752
did you find out
anything about him?

401
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,054
Actually, I have a photo
of him right here.

402
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:02,090
Randy Lee Austin.

403
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:03,658
54 years old.

404
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,662
He was kind of a drifter.
Came to Sedona in 2005.

405
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,265
He would spend
a lot of time at Relics.

406
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,667
What about the day of his death?
What happened?

407
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,803
April 4, 2006,
he went to Relics,

408
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,171
spent some time there

409
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,907
at your client's
establishment.

410
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:21,075
Okay.
- And, as it got dark,

411
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:22,710
he left the bar.
A couple witnesses

412
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:24,646
had seem him
crossing the street.

413
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,115
Another witness said
he saw him gettin' down,

414
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,817
actually just laying down,
facedown, on the street,

415
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,221
when an oncoming car
skidded right over

416
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,356
the top of him,
killing him instantly.

417
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,226
Here is a copy

418
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:42,063
of the obituary
in the newspaper.

419
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:43,765
Why would he be laying down
on the road, though?

420
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,700
Well, he was
an alcoholic.

421
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,806
I'm getting another death here.

422
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,612
There's something
about a car accident.

423
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:06,487
Somebody **** up
their back, bad.

424
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,723
So **** bad.

425
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,692
My God.

426
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:13,661
I think the dog foretells
accidents and stuff,

427
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,396
that it likes to do that.

428
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,637
I think that, if the living

429
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,206
encounter the dog,
in some fashion,

430
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,109
like it could be
like a harbinger

431
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,844
of death.

432
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,883
If the living see
or hear this dog,

433
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:39,687
it means they're
going to die soon.

434
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,522
But it doesn't mean
they're gonna die here,

435
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,725
like the car accident thing.

436
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,194
But it seems like some people

437
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:49,897
who start their dying process
here or who die here,

438
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,333
you're either stuck
in your death state

439
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:55,036
or you're like turned
into a mannequin.

440
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,313
If you need us to investigate

441
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,215
unexplained activity
in your home,

442
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:10,284
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

443
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,552
Click on "Help me,
Dead Files!"

444
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:12,854
to submit your story
and we'll help if we can.

445
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:25,492
You could pretty much
throw a dart

446
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,861
at a map of the U.S.
and you'll hit a spot

447
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:29,996
where the Native Americans
got the shaft.

448
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:31,331
It's no different here.

449
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,266
I'm on my way to meet
with an author who's going to

450
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,635
tell me about what the locals
call The Removal.

451
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,512
So, Melissa, thanks for
helpin' me out with this case.

452
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,180
Before we get to The Removal,

453
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,948
who were the
Native Americans here?

454
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,784
Okay, there were two
basic tribes in the area.

455
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,119
They were the Yavapai
and the Apache

456
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,688
and they both came in
about the same time,

457
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,057
about the mid-1400s.

458
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,359
After the Civil War,
late 1860s,

459
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:02,462
people started pushing West,
so, first, the miners

460
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,631
came in, looking
for gold and silver,

461
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,300
and then, right after them
came white settlers.

462
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,169
Okay. So how'd that go?

463
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,670
Well, it didn't go
very well.

464
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,273
There were minor clashes
here and there,

465
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:17,577
until 1872 and the
Skeleton Cave Massacre.

466
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,745
Okay, so what happened there?

467
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,780
The soldiers were told
to round up

468
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,182
all the Yavapai
and Apache

469
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,917
and bring them
to the new reservation.

470
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,652
They heard that
there were some Apache

471
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,587
held up in a cave.

472
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,456
They went to get them
and they fought back.

473
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,191
How many did they kill?

474
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,927
Well, they killed
75 Indians

475
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,462
and they captured
probably 30.

476
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:36,863
That's brutal.

477
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,631
That was brutal.
As a matter of fact,

478
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:42,802
this picture is
of the cave in 1908.

479
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,671
So these bones were there
this whole time?

480
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,539
They were there
the whole time.

481
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,841
And, of course,
a lot of the bones

482
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,809
were scattered
by wild animals.

483
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,545
So the next plan,
in 1875,

484
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:56,516
was to march them
180 miles south to the

485
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,119
San Carlos reservation,
close to Phoenix.

486
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,087
For whatever reason,
they decided to do this

487
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:02,389
in February.

488
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,991
1,500 people
started the march

489
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,560
and hundreds died
along the way.

490
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:10,897
I'm curious 'cause,
Native Americans,

491
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:12,599
the way they bury people
is pretty sacred.

492
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,167
What happened with the dead
along the trail?

493
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,301
They were not allowed

494
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,003
to stop and take care
of the dead.

495
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,872
They were forced
to just leave the dead,

496
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,107
or probably
sick or injured,

497
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,309
where they lay
and just keep marching.

498
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:24,778
That's pretty nasty.

499
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,914
It is, yeah. And,
unfortunately, the whites

500
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,150
didn't have much empathy
for the Indians, you know?

501
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,186
They had trouble
seeing them as "human."

502
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,263
A Native American
came up to me.

503
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:46,833
I'm feeling
a lot of people,

504
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,101
being disturbed.

505
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:52,105
They're not
being able to rest.

506
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,406
This isn't right.

507
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,842
This is wrong.
They're very unhappy.

508
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,110
They're very sad.

509
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:58,778
There's a lot of crying.

510
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,513
Do you know what happened
to the dead here?

511
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:05,652
It was over a period of time
and they were happy, dead,

512
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:10,390
and then something happened
and they woke up

513
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:14,994
and then they were disturbed
and they're unhappy and crying.

514
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:16,930
Do you have any idea
of when this happened?

515
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,132
It was dirt.

516
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,967
Long time ago.

517
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:25,939
There's so much illness
and mental anguish.

518
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,042
I'm feeling a lot of panic
back here, a lot of chaos.

519
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:35,882
I feel like the living
who are here a lot,

520
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:38,818
they could form disorders.

521
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,954
And I mean like
full-on disorders,

522
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,490
like general-anxiety disorders.

523
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,592
Severe stomach issues
would develop.

524
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,228
Esophagus issues would develop.

525
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,763
This is bad.

526
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,304
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

527
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,807
but the dead people
propped up like mannequins

528
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,410
in the dining room
had me the most concerned.

529
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:08,681
It's dark
and they can't move.

530
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:11,784
They're trapped
inside their bodies?

531
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,188
And their eyes were
very scary to me.

532
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,591
They were extremely intense.

533
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,569
Is this what you saw?

534
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,104
Yes, that's what I saw.

535
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,512
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

536
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,614
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

537
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,450
and our clients
for the first time.

538
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,619
So, Amy,
I want you to meet Joe.

539
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,221
You wanna know how many
experiences he's had?

540
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,123
Zero. None.

541
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,558
Reason he's called us in is

542
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,161
because of people like Deborah,
who's his office manager;

543
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,331
and Heather, who worked here
for a few years.

544
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,399
They've had a lot
of experiences.

545
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,069
Joe thinks the paranormal
is costing him business,

546
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,771
but his biggest concern
is the safety

547
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,341
for his customers
and his employees.

548
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,575
He wants to know
what the hell is here

549
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,577
and how to get rid of it.

550
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,612
So now that I told Amy
a little bit about you guys,

551
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,882
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk.

552
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:37,087
When I arrived,
I was very distracted

553
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,358
by a lot of chaotic
and confusing energy.

554
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,628
It had to do
with random objects.

555
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,066
Specifically, the wood
flooring was bothersome.

556
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:56,740
The bar and some objects
on display in the back room,

557
00:27:56,742 --> 00:28:00,910
these items were
emitting chaotic energy

558
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:05,315
and it just added
to the overall

559
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,551
intense energy
of this location.

560
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,286
Amy, there's a few things
you should know about Joe

561
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,688
and this place.

562
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,123
Now, you were talkin' about
the floor and the bar.

563
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,891
Joe and his business
partner, Karyn,

564
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,861
did extensive renovations
on this place

565
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,929
when they bought it
about 13 years ago.

566
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,499
Joe sank his life
savings into it.

567
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:26,803
This what the bar
used to look like before.

568
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,905
This is circa 1980.
- Wow.

569
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,540
Obviously,
just from comin' in here,

570
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,510
you can see the huge amount
of work that was done.

571
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,911
Interesting.

572
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,446
That makes a lot of sense.

573
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,684
So, during my walk,

574
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,755
I'm getting sicker
and sicker and drained.

575
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,325
I do think that living
individuals here

576
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,163
might feel some
of that at times,

577
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:57,066
because there's a lot of stress,
a lot of anxiety.

578
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,903
And what I got,
in extreme cases,

579
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,339
so if you're here consistently
or if you're really sensitive,

580
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,677
you could develop some
stomach problems, like ulcers.

581
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,978
Amy, there's something
you should know about

582
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,514
the two ladies
on both sides of Joe.

583
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,050
Both of them are sensitives

584
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,553
and both of them have
spent a lot of time here.

585
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,588
Now, we didn't discuss sickness

586
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,089
when I interviewed
both you ladies,

587
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,860
but anxiety and stress
was definitely a thing.

588
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,729
I agree with the stress
and the anxiety.

589
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,765
Just so much pressure,

590
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,569
so much energy coming
at you all at once.

591
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:37,440
Deborah, you talked to me about
the bad vibes in this place.

592
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,042
There was
a extended period

593
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,077
where there were
a lot of dissension,

594
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,647
a lot of arguments, a lot
of customer complaints,

595
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,350
and it was going on
amongst many people

596
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,486
for a prolonged period,
and even among people

597
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,388
who are normally
eventempered.

598
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,623
Interesting.

599
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,226
Okay, so what else
on the walk?

600
00:29:56,228 --> 00:30:00,497
So, I went into the kitchen

601
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,632
and what I saw happening
in the kitchen

602
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,035
were a lot of ridiculous
accidents

603
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:10,273
and the thing that was causing
these accidents was a dead dog.

604
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,343
I got that it
is extremely negative

605
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:18,047
and it's been here
for a<i> very</i> long time.

606
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,317
The living might feel it
brush up against them.

607
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,921
They might feel weight against
them, causing them to move.

608
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:29,792
If people encounter the dog
and they see it or they hear it,

609
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:34,597
that could actually indicate
that that person might die.

610
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,137
It doesn't cause
someone to die,

611
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:47,076
but it could possibly
foretell their death.

612
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,646
You're talkin' about
accidents in the kitchen.

613
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,748
Joe, tell Amy

614
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,450
what happened
to Karyn with the cup.

615
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:59,489
Karyn actually experienced
a cup fly across the room

616
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,558
and she was in there
with one of her cooks

617
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,326
and they both saw it.

618
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,595
Now, she also told somethin'
'bout her gettin'...

619
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,464
Brushed behind her,
that's correct.

620
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,700
She was just walking
through

621
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,769
the dining room up front.

622
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,905
and she experienced
something behind her

623
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,907
that she could sense
very clearly,

624
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,642
but nothing was there
when she looked.

625
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,077
Boy.

626
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,646
That's not good.

627
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,484
So what else?

628
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,920
There were a couple of people
that I encountered

629
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,856
who seemed to be stuck
in their death states

630
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,493
and reliving their deaths
over and over and over again.

631
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:42,098
I encountered one individual
in the bar area.

632
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,967
This was a younger male.

633
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,669
I got that this person was shot

634
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:51,841
and it felt like my insides
were just ripped apart.

635
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,644
It was<i> extremely</i> painful.

636
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,148
I know that it took quite
some time to die from this.

637
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,317
Somethin' I came across
in my research,

638
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,020
there was a guy who was shot

639
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,689
and then died
in the parkin' lot right here.

640
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,292
This happened
on May 25, 1957.

641
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,027
19-year-old
George Nelson came here

642
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,129
with some friends for a drink.

643
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,597
I actually have
a picture of him.

644
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,968
So, now, when they finished
drinking here,

645
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,838
George, two guys, and two girls
piled into a car

646
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,206
and started to leave.

647
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,908
Guy in the front seat
that was driving was married.

648
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,945
And the guy sitting
in the back had a girlfriend.

649
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,913
During the drive, George noticed
that there was a car

650
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,416
following 'em
right outside here.

651
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,550
Before he could do anything,

652
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,453
a shot went through
the back windshield.

653
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,688
He was struck in the head
by the bullet,

654
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,822
but it didn't kill him
right away.

655
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,593
They drove back here
to the parkin' lot

656
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:47,363
and he wound up goin' DOA here.

657
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,600
gunshot wound to the head.

658
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:58,241
Now, the case is still unsolved,
but I spoke to George's nephew.

659
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,978
He thinks that the car
that followed them belonged

660
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,881
to the girlfriend
of one of the guys in the car.

661
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,215
According to him,
the girl was jealous

662
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,484
and she mighta been
tryin' to scare them,

663
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,752
wound up killin' a guy.

664
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,655
But she was never questioned
about the shooting.

665
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,457
Wow.

666
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,362
So I'm back in the kitchen

667
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,798
and I felt that there
was another death.

668
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,801
It had to do with something
with the dog.

669
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:28,738
I got that there
was a car accident,

670
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,042
their back
was horribly damaged.

671
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,412
I was in so much pain at the
time that I had to kneel down.

672
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:42,485
I got that this happened
very close to this location.

673
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,553
I think I know
what she's talkin' about.

674
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,054
I'm pretty sure you do.

675
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,322
There was a car accident
that happened

676
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,826
right on the street here
next to Relics back in 2006.

677
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:54,130
Randy Austin, he was
a regular customer here.

678
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,467
I've got a photo.

679
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,969
Now, he drank here all the time,
pretty much every day.

680
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,904
We found out he was a drifter,
kind of a homeless guy,

681
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,539
here and there.

682
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,543
On April 4, 2006,
after a long day of drinking,

683
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,579
he walked out of the bar

684
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,881
and laid facedown on the road,
for some reason.

685
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,316
What?

686
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,917
Now, it's pitch-black out there.

687
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,353
Oncoming car didn't him
until it was too late.

688
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,489
It ran right over him.
- My --

689
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,990
He died at the scene.

690
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,225
Now, the driver was cleared.

691
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,494
It was obviously an accident.

692
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,429
He was known
by a lot of people

693
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,165
and it was a very sad
incident when that occurred.

694
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,668
No one really understood
why he did that, either.

695
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,272
So, Amy, do you think
that's the same guy?

696
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,142
It could be.

697
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,577
Which is awful.

698
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,013
If it is him,
it's unfortunate

699
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,450
because he would be stuck
in his death state.

700
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,423
Okay, so we've got accidents.
We got shootings.

701
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,159
What else?

702
00:34:56,161 --> 00:35:01,631
I went into the area that is
kinda like decorated Victorian.

703
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,900
Which is that front dining room.

704
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:10,473
And there were these
smoky, grayish, blackish,

705
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:15,344
foggy things
that had light for eyes.

706
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,818
Aaaaah!

707
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,920
What?

708
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,055
Just, those things are here.

709
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,894
I kinda pride myself on not
being afraid of too many things

710
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,163
and this just really
caught me off-guard.

711
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,631
What are these things?

712
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,569
They're elementals, which means
they were never alive.

713
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,739
And then, at the tables,
I saw like

714
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,542
what initially I thought
were mannequins

715
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,678
and there were
about 10 of 'em.

716
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,716
And then I hear the screaming
and I'm like "Okay."

717
00:35:53,718 --> 00:36:00,756
What I got was that these
entities had, over<i> many</i> years,

718
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,460
collected several
deceased people

719
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:08,397
and, unfortunately through
that collecting process,

720
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:16,372
they have trapped them here,
their souls and their bodies.

721
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,441
- All right.
- Walking into the dining room,

722
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,508
- Yeah.
- what did I see?

723
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,878
- Yeah, tell her.
- People just --

724
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,446
between 5 and 12,

725
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:26,649
just standing
amongst the diners,

726
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,918
for no reason.

727
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,255
It was
an uncomfortable feeling.

728
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,223
I did have a sketch done.

729
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,693
Frankly, I did find it
very disturbing.

730
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,029
I would not spend
a long time in that room.

731
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,797
It absolutely creeped me out.

732
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,472
I don't know if you guys
wanna go back in that room

733
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,640
after seein' this.

734
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,655
I recognize it.

735
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:06,923
Really?

736
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,324
Yeah.

737
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,192
I've seen
this sort of thing

738
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,863
many, many times,
over and over again.

739
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:17,633
It's like something
from a horror movie.

740
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,303
This means a lot,
that you've seen this,

741
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:24,073
because I can't share this
with other people.

742
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,910
So what do these smoky creatures
want with the dead people?

743
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,782
They're collecting them because
they think they're beautiful.

744
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,150
Like they're dolls.

745
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,918
They just put 'em
where they want 'em.

746
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,187
- Like a toy to them.
- Yeah.

747
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,892
And you believe
that those individuals

748
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,696
may be these individuals?

749
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,297
I think it's highly likely.

750
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,803
So, Deborah, I noticed
you got a little emotional.

751
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,305
Well, I think
the suffering

752
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,809
of those souls needs
to be addressed.

753
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,912
Joe, it looks like you
called us in just in time.

754
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,047
It is bad.
It's really bad.

755
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,009
So, Joe,
I know you're a skeptic,

756
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,579
but you gotta be pretty blown
away by what you heard tonight.

757
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,814
- Absolutely.
- Now comes the hard part.

758
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:32,283
We're gonna find out
what it's gonna take for you

759
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,319
to make your restaurant
safe again

760
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,987
and, for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

761
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:44,329
The first thing
is the residual energy.

762
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:49,968
The entire location needs to be
cleaned, from top to bottom,

763
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,508
I'm thinking about one time
per month, for 6 months.

764
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,245
I know that's a big job,
but this is the best thing

765
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:03,748
to remove all of this
collected energy.

766
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,950
And then, once that's done,

767
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:09,053
a shaman and a medium need
to be contacted,

768
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,390
who are willing
to work together.

769
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:16,428
What I would like the shaman
to do is to perform a ritual

770
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,666
to reach out to the elementals,
to appease them.

771
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:26,004
Once that ritual's completed,
the medium needs to step in

772
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:28,406
and help any
of the deceased individuals

773
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,842
who don't go on their own.

774
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:32,777
Many will probably just leave,

775
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,281
but some might be a little
stunned, confused,

776
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:40,318
and the medium may need to
assist them in moving them on.

777
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
Will the dog go, too?

778
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,888
Yes.

779
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,223
So, when the shaman
comes in,

780
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,659
is he gonna get rid
of these smoky things?

781
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:51,029
No. What he or she
will do is

782
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:56,634
a ritual that will send
a clear message and intention

783
00:39:56,636 --> 00:40:00,505
that they are being
acknowledged,

784
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:05,877
that respect will now be given,
that we understand

785
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:08,947
what they've been through,
and things of that nature.

786
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,148
All right.
So they'll stay here,

787
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,850
but they're not gonna trap
any more souls.

788
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,786
Correct.

789
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,255
They'll leave, but these
guys are still here,

790
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:18,656
with the scary eyes,

791
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:22,093
shootin' down
in my dining room?

792
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:24,596
Unfortunately, yes.

793
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:27,465
So people may see these
things, living people?

794
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,336
I think, if they're
sensitive, yeah.

795
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:34,906
Then, after that,
at least once a week,

796
00:40:34,908 --> 00:40:38,710
you need to make an offering
to the elementals.

797
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:42,347
And my suggestion is to go
to one of the local

798
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,718
metaphysical stores and,
whatever you feel pulled to,

799
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,655
that's them letting you know,
"This is what we want."

800
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,992
So you bring that object
back and you say,

801
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,426
"This is now for you"

802
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:59,931
and you can select an area
to place the object in.

803
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:02,901
So as far as the cleansing,
once a month for 6 months,

804
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:03,902
how will it feel
for them?

805
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:05,904
Yeah.
It's gonna be good.

806
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:07,205
Good energy.

807
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:11,309
I'm very pleased that all
of this came out.

808
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:13,578
I'm willing to try it.

809
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,946
So, Joe, I know
you put your heart

810
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,582
and soul into this place
and it means everything to you.

811
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:20,018
As far as all this stuff
Amy suggests to do,

812
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,921
are you gonna
take that task on?

813
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:25,890
Absolutely.

814
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:28,626
It's too easy.

815
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:30,795
Joe has a lot of work to do,
if he wants to keep

816
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:34,132
his employees and guests
out of harm's way.

817
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,333
With the help of a shaman,

818
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:38,069
the elementals will stop
trapping the dead;

819
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:40,939
and, with the help of a medium,
the dead can move on,

820
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,508
allowing Joe to run
his restaurant safely

821
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,343
for many years to come.
