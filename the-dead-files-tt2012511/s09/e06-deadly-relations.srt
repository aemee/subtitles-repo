1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,230
He can do
physical stuff.

2
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:13,795
He can touch you.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,660
Your mom was murdered
right here in this room?

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,820
Yes, she was.

5
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:17,935
She's pissed.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,355
She feels
like she's being tortured.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,715
A shadow person
started to charge at me.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,040
I think that a living person
was attacked.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,840
He shoots himself
in the mouth,

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,310
and the bullet comes out
the top of his head.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,450
What is this thing?

12
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:34,980
A demon.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,720
He doesn't want anybody here.

14
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:39,957
I just hear death.

15
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,160
My name is Amy Allan.

16
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,755
God.

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,790
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,865
I see dead people.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,160
Her face was all demonic.

20
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,865
I speak to dead people.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,700
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

22
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:54,065
And they speak to me.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,605
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,770
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

26
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,340
I rely on my partner.

27
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,875
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,650
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

29
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,115
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,350
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

31
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:11,485
They're everywhere.

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,885
It's my job to reveal them.

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,990
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

34
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,755
But Steve and I never speak...

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,830
We never communicate
during an investigation.

36
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,025
...until the very end...

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,695
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

38
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,600
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

39
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,665
That's it.

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,935
...or time to get out.

41
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,210
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm in the small town
of Lake City, Florida,

43
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,430
about an hour west
of Jacksonville.

44
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,590
I got a call from a woman

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,460
who was crying hysterically
on the phone.

46
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,865
She says her house
is a war zone.

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,230
She says, if things
don't change soon,

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,375
someone's gonna
get hurt really bad.

49
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,510
I'm hoping Amy and I
can help her out,

50
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,110
'cause she sounded terrible.

51
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,210
Before Amy arrives,
I need to make sure

52
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,680
any photographs,
religious symbols,

53
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,150
or personal items
that may influence her findings

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,820
are removed
or hidden from sight.

55
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,025
When I'm finished,

56
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,930
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,510
There's, like,
a lot of pain here.

58
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,980
This one guy in particular
who died,

59
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:47,215
he's not, like, human.

60
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,615
He's, tall, really tall.

61
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,520
Um, but he is kind of
like an orange, red --

62
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:57,260
like, that kind of a color.

63
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,790
He...thinks, like,

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,600
humans, I guess,
are interesting,

65
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,770
and he likes to imitate them.

66
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,275
So when he is imitating them,

67
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,710
he takes on
a more human, form.

68
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,280
He's not a good thing.

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,690
So, Regina,
I'm glad I'm here now,

70
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,020
'cause when we spoke
on the phone,

71
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,995
you sounded
pretty desperate.

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,595
My nieces, my cousins' kids,
my nephews --

73
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,000
they won't come over no more
'cause they're terrified.

74
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,217
Well, do you have
children of your own?

75
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,400
No, me and my husband
can't have kids.

76
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,740
It breaks my heart.

77
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,170
All right, so, give me
a list of what's happening.

78
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,730
Knocking and banging
and things move around.

79
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:55,280
Um, we've seen
shadow people -- apparitions.

80
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,840
Um, and lately, it's been
getting kind of violent

81
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,390
with people getting scratched,
pushed, shoved.

82
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,990
Okay, so, when did you guys
move in?

83
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:07,230
Um, we moved in,
um, 2005.

84
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,640
And we moved in to take care
of my husband's grandmother.

85
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, what can you
tell me about it?

86
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,695
His mother was killed.

87
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,380
Your husband's mother?

88
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,897
In this house?

89
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:23,821
Who did it?

90
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,710
Her brother.

91
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,450
My husband will tell
you more about it.

92
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,780
Okay.

93
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,450
Now, you said
you moved here to take care

94
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:32,102
of your husband's
grandmother.

95
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,720
Did she witness
the murder?

96
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:35,020
Yes.

97
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,190
Okay, is she still alive?

98
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,395
No.

99
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,730
Okay, when did she pass?

100
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,165
Um, 2008.

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,395
Here's a picture
of Dorothy.

102
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,000
And how old was she
when she passed?

103
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,530
Um, 92.

104
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,390
Where did she die?
And what'd she die of?

105
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:52,240
Um, natural causes.
And here, at the house.

106
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,205
She had dementia.

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,350
It was a hard thing
'cause that's the first time

108
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,950
I've ever really
watched somebody die.

109
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,185
Okay.

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,620
Have you done anything
to try to fix things here?

111
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,837
I have saged the house.

112
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,020
I have salted the yard.

113
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,430
There was always something
about the side yard

114
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,095
I've never liked.

115
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,615
Why don't you
like it outside?

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,065
One morning --
it was early --

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,630
I went outside the door
and looked up.

118
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,435
And there was, like, a --

119
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,205
a shadow person
about 6 foot...

120
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,475
maybe bigger --
started to charge at me.

121
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,030
And I'm like, "Whoa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

122
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,550
There's something out there,
something<i> bad.</i>

123
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,925
Someone put a barrier up.

124
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,555
It's keeping
this tall thing out.

125
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,160
He can't come in here
and do anything.

126
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,960
And he's angry about it.

127
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,270
Is it just focused
on this house?

128
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,905
Yes.

129
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,170
It looks at it
as, like, a challenge.

130
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,645
He says
that he will find a way.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,080
He<i> will.</i>
He<i> will</i> find a way.

132
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,650
Okay, what are you
experiencing in here?

133
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,120
Um, when I was
sitting on the couch,

134
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:15,820
it was sitting behind me.
Okay.

135
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,230
And I seen, like, a light
out of the corner of my eye.

136
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,812
I looked at it.
And it came down.

137
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,360
But it had
Uncle Jack's face on it

138
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,820
as it disappeared
in the chair.

139
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,235
All right.
Who's Uncle Jack?

140
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,340
My husband's uncle
who was involved

141
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,592
with the murder-suicide.

142
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:31,468
Were you on any medication?

143
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:33,275
No.
Nothing like that.

144
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,780
That woulda freaked me out
a little bit.

145
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:37,040
Okay.
Anything else?

146
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,750
Last night, I was out there
in the laundry room.

147
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:41,980
Something came up
and hit me in my back.

148
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,350
It felt like somebody had,
like, a knife or a screwdriver,

149
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,185
and he went down into it.

150
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,990
Getting assaulted, basically
is what's going on.
Yes.

151
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,255
Anything else going on?

152
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,930
Little shadow person,
about yea big.

153
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:53,730
He runs around.

154
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:54,965
All right.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,530
So, this -- the shadow,
how big are we talking?

156
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,530
Um, about that big.

157
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,170
Well, what about
the dog casting a shadow

158
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,302
as it's running around?

159
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,400
When I see it,
usually,

160
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,370
I can see my two dogs
in here with me.

161
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,990
He can run...after them...
and follow them.

162
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,460
You mean
when they leave here?

163
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:22,455
Yes.

164
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,425
I see him,
like, in a car.

165
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,530
He says he gets really little,
when he does that.

166
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,600
Can you describe what it looks
like when it's small?

167
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,735
It looks like a troll.

168
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,570
But the thing is, like,
it's really muscular.

169
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,305
Do the living see it?

170
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,380
I see a living person
looking out...the door

171
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:47,367
and seeing it,
like, quick outside.

172
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:51,011
And I -- you know,
I would be concerned

173
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:54,620
about him trying
to injure them in the car.

174
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,972
What is this thing?

175
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,290
Some kind of demon.

176
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,330
So, what's going on
in here?

177
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,500
I constantly feel
like I'm being watched.

178
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,800
But it's coming
from the outside,

179
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,540
like something's
out the window,

180
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,170
looking inward.

181
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,140
Just...I feel
like somebody's out there,

182
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,975
standing there,
watching me.

183
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,450
All right.
Anything else happening in here?

184
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,282
Yeah.
I was scratched in here.

185
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,080
Here's the pictures
of them.

186
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,990
One's on my chest
and on my lower stomach.

187
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,090
That's pretty bad scratches.
These are pretty deep.

188
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,095
Yeah.

189
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,395
You sure the dog
didn't do this?

190
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,660
Dogs aren't
allowed in my bed.

191
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,395
So there's no way.

192
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,695
So how the hell are you
sleeping at night

193
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,200
knowing that, you know,
this could happen to you?

194
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,630
I have
a lot of nightmares.

195
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,870
Now, describe
the nightmares to me.

196
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:42,100
What are we
talking about?

197
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,010
Bad things happening
to my husband.

198
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,640
Sometimes, they're violent.

199
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,185
There's a lot of energy
in this house.

200
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,020
That's why the dead are
so attracted to this place.

201
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
There's a military officer.

202
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,400
He's like...

203
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,000
"Stand down.

204
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,670
Stand down."

205
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,275
And I feel sick.
I feel sick.

206
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,150
Like, I feel his fear,
like, shaking.

207
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,915
He can bother the living.

208
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,720
If he feels like people
are too much in his space,

209
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,485
he wigs out.

210
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,720
He can do physical stuff.

211
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,330
He can touch them, like...

212
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,825
poking really hard.

213
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,760
He can make you feel sick.

214
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,535
He can touch you.

215
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,540
He's like, "You don't want
to see when I get angry."

216
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,170
Bad.

217
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,030
So, John, I know this is not
easy to talk about.

218
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,240
But your mom was murdered
right here in this room.

219
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,370
Yes, she was.

220
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,080
It happened right here.
Her chair was sitting here.

221
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,575
Assassinated her.

222
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,815
He killed himself
20 minutes later.

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,020
The bullet hole's still up
in the ceiling right there.

224
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:29,185
Wow.

225
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,185
Now, what about
your grandmother? Where was she?

226
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,320
She was sitting over there
in the corner in her chair.

227
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,890
And when it happened,
she got up and ran outside.

228
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,295
This is my mom, Becky,

229
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,735
and my Grandma Dorothy
and my Uncle Jack.

230
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,830
And this is the uncle that --
that did this thing?

231
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,930
Yes, sir.

232
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,570
How old was your mom
when she passed?

233
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,375
59.

234
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,405
What kind of woman
was she?

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,370
She was a nurse --
the head nurse.

236
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,680
She didn't get her way...
there'd be hell to pay.

237
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,845
She was very difficult
to be around.

238
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,715
Sounds like you guys
had a tough relationship.
Yes.

239
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,550
So, John, any indication
as to why your uncle snapped?

240
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,787
He was...

241
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,955
a military vet.

242
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,825
I think he had PTSD.

243
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,625
He was...real crazy.

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,300
Okay, so this man
was a troubled guy?

245
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,595
Yes.

246
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,670
You find it hard staying here
knowing this happened here?

247
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,100
Yes.

248
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,110
Do you ever think maybe
you should leave this place

249
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,370
because of what happened?

250
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,540
Yes,
but it's financial reasons.

251
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,875
We can't.

252
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,750
Do you think...any one
of those people are here?

253
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,015
I feel my ma.

254
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,800
And I s--
I hear my grandma.

255
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,550
What about your Uncle Jack?

256
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I think he's here, too.

257
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:40,320
I just feel his presence.

258
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,090
Okay.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm seeing
the military guy again.

260
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:53,600
He's tough and very,
territorial.

261
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,900
I think he lived here.

262
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,410
I feel like he had a lot
to do with this house.

263
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:03,097
Like, he's like,
"Get the **** out."

264
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:07,750
He's got issues.
He's got mega issues.

265
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,690
It is<i> terrible</i> back here.

266
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,800
Have you had
any experiences?

267
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:19,795
Yes.

268
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,465
Okay.
Tell me what happened.

269
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,770
I was standing in the middle
of the living room one evening.

270
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:24,765
Okay.

271
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,140
And it felt
like something shoved me

272
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:29,527
and on my lower part
of my leg.

273
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,401
And I went forward
into the window.

274
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,240
And you're sure
you didn't trip?

275
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,800
I didn't trip.
I was just standing there.

276
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,350
You're lucky
you didn't cut an artery.

277
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,800
Something very bad...
happened here.

278
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,065
You know what?

279
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,930
I think that a living person
was attacked in here,

280
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,330
like, bad.

281
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,170
I wanna say this is that dude --
the angry military guy.

282
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,175
Think I hear glass breaking.

283
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,780
And I'm feeling it,
like, on me.

284
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,545
I'm, like, falling down.

285
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,515
And there's,
like, glass everywhere.

286
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,450
Like, I'm being pushed.
I can't breathe.

287
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,655
They end up on the floor.

288
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,060
This angry man,
he doesn't want anybody here.

289
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,130
Why'd you bring me
out here?

290
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,905
I...have a feeling

291
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,070
of an ominous presence
in the woods.

292
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,410
Are you feeling it
right now?

293
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,335
Yes. I --

294
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,705
What --
what are you feeling?

295
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,080
Something's watching me...
over in the woods.

296
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,447
It's looking at me
right now.

297
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:44,780
Where's it looking
at you from?

298
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,220
It's over there.

299
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,955
But you can't see it.

300
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,450
I can't see it.
But I feel it.

301
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,860
All right.
Anything else?

302
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,055
Banging.

303
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,355
Okay.
What kind of banging?

304
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,245
Like somebody knocking
on the door?
Yeah.

305
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,100
Like,
cabinets opening and closing.

306
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:00,795
I was in the kitchen
one time.

307
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,780
And, there was a dish
on the sink.

308
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,730
It fell off the counter,
onto the floor.

309
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,035
It broke my toe.

310
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,200
And so what makes you think
that's paranormal?

311
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,840
Nobody touched it.
I didn't touch it.

312
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,170
Think it was pushed.

313
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,975
It's just devious.

314
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,740
I don't know what it is.

315
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,780
There's a woman.

316
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,280
She has an accent.

317
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,475
I feel like
this is<i> really</i> recent.

318
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,660
She says that
if she would not have died,

319
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,012
none of this would be going on.

320
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,295
I'm gonna say
that she lived here.

321
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,300
She was cooking
and cleaning all the time.

322
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:37,000
She's slamming,
slamming, slamming,

323
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,635
banging, banging, banging.

324
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,070
She says she keeps
trying to leave.

325
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:45,710
But she says someone keeps --

326
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:46,840
living person --

327
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,610
a living person
keeps pulling her back,

328
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,250
keeps calling her back.

329
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,540
This is a living female
doing this to her.

330
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:03,760
She's sleeping.
Living lady's sleeping.

331
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,195
She goes into her dream.

332
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,900
And she gives
the living woman nightmares.

333
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:09,865
She's pissed.

334
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,640
She feels
like she's being tortured.

335
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:15,100
She says that they know her,

336
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,375
that they know her.

337
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,610
They know she's here.

338
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,062
They know she's here.

339
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,445
They know she's here.

340
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,145
"Why won't they let me go?

341
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,810
Why won't they let me go?

342
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,120
They know I'm here.

343
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,180
Let me go.

344
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,890
Let me go."

345
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,395
Well, obviously,
the first thing

346
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm gonna look into
is this murder-suicide.

347
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,865
Now, John gave me a lot

348
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,110
of good information about
why his uncle might've snapped.

349
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:53,575
But I wanna know exactly
what happened that day.

350
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,050
I'm heading over to meet with
a Jacksonville medical examiner

351
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,150
who's gonna take me through
the crime second by second.

352
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,785
The murder takes place
September 19, 2005.

353
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,555
Can you take me through that,
exactly what happened?

354
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,330
Apparently, the sister, Becky,
is sitting on the recliner.

355
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,865
Jack comes up behind her

356
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,705
and shoots her one time
in the back of her head.

357
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,510
And she probably turns
to see what happened.

358
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:26,280
And then,
she takes a second shot

359
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,375
to her left temple area.

360
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,215
Based on the crime scene
photographs,

361
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,170
it doesn't seem
like she moved anywhere.

362
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,090
She just died right there
in the recliner.

363
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,490
The woman
who is being trapped here

364
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:45,625
won't talk about her death.

365
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,200
She's, like,
really trying to block me

366
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,860
from getting how she died.

367
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,550
She said...

368
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,230
Let's just say,

369
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,570
like, her death was
a freak accident.

370
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:57,672
Um, she was young.

371
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,740
She was only, 52.

372
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,327
It's wicked bad.

373
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,880
She wants to leave.

374
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,020
All right,
so she basically didn't even

375
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,080
know what hit her?

376
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:08,185
Probably not.

377
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,350
Well, Jack --
how does he kill himself?

378
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:12,585
He shoots himself
in the mouth.

379
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,190
And the bullet
comes out the top of his head,

380
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:17,025
like you see right here.

381
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,030
And then, he falls back
and dies in that hallway.

382
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:21,895
Okay, so, Doctor,

383
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,100
I'm assuming
a toxicology was done?

384
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,030
Yes.

385
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,175
He had
multiple medications.

386
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,275
They were not
illegal drugs

387
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,970
or drugs of abuse
that were in his system.

388
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,040
Do we know
what he was taking drugs for?

389
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,640
He suffered from PTSD,

390
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,010
because he was
in the Vietnam War.

391
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,320
Apparently, he was
a helicopter pilot

392
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,015
and was shot down twice.

393
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,050
Okay.
In addition,
he was depressed.

394
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,425
He suffered from
Parkinson's disease.

395
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,930
He had a heart condition --
apparently, had a heart attack

396
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:54,030
prior to him coming to live
with his sister,

397
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,530
who was gonna
take care of him.

398
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:56,765
And do we have any idea

399
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,270
<i>why</i> he might have wanted
to kill his sister?

400
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,940
His mother had signed over
the deed of the house

401
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:04,405
to his sister.

402
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,080
And this right here
is the deed.

403
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,450
So he got cut out
altogether.

404
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,815
That's correct.

405
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,050
He had, um, what we interpret
to be a suicide note.

406
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,722
This is very brief.

407
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,458
He says he's depressed.

408
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,125
"Becky is mean to us."

409
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,560
And then, he says
he didn't want any CPR.

410
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,595
He didn't want
any resuscitation.

411
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,260
So he wanted to make sure
that he would die.

412
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,170
I feel like he had a lot
to do with this house

413
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,505
'cause he's like,

414
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,140
"Get the **** out."

415
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,580
The angry dead man
who attacks the living

416
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,050
is following me everywhere I go.

417
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,715
He's furious that I'm here.

418
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,320
But I'm not leaving
until I find out

419
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,207
who he was in life.

420
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,025
He had a heart attack.

421
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,060
Feel like he started dying here
or died here.

422
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,260
Feel like he was in wars.

423
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,595
He fought in wars.

424
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,570
And he had injuries
or something.

425
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:07,440
His legs feel...so weird...

426
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,745
...like, burning,
like, they're on fire.

427
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,980
He is angry, angry,
angry, angry, angry.

428
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,155
If you need us
to investigate

429
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,055
unexplained activity
in your home,

430
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,440
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

431
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:31,790
Click on "Help Me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story.

432
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,760
And we'll help if we can.

433
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,090
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

434
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,527
in a house where
a murder-suicide took place.

435
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,930
But I need to see
if there's anything else

436
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,930
that's gonna help
my investigation.

437
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,085
Reading two old
newspaper articles,

438
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,835
I find one of
the original owners

439
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,170
of my clients' property
was a sheriff.

440
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,605
Turns out a local
Syrian couple was murdered.

441
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,040
And he was caught right in
the middle of the scandal.

442
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,110
So, I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

443
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,345
who says he's got information

444
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,850
that will definitely
help my case.

445
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,560
The sheriff that lived
on my clients' property,

446
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:19,755
what can you
tell me about him?

447
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,160
Sheriff Wiley "Babe" Douglass,
born in 1885.

448
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:26,062
He became chief of police
in the city in 1920.

449
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,930
He must have been very popular,
very charismatic

450
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,840
because he ran
for sheriff and won.

451
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,975
This is him
in his uniform

452
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,245
shortly after
winning that election.

453
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,330
What kind of sheriff
was he, though?

454
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:40,380
I mean,
what are we talking about?

455
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,715
Well, he was corrupt.

456
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,950
Sheriff Douglass was accused
of bootlegging,

457
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:48,055
running gambling
operations.

458
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,560
And he was also accused
of selling young women

459
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:52,290
into prostitution.

460
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,455
Geez.

461
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,990
Why exactly does he come onto
my clients' property?

462
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,395
Do we know that?

463
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,930
Well, Steve, he purchases
your clients' property in 1928.

464
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,200
All right.
So let's get to the murders.

465
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:02,435
What exactly happened?

466
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,140
The Romey family,
they're a successful,

467
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:07,492
Syrian family,
immigrants.

468
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,775
They own
a small produce store.

469
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,310
The Romeys' son, Esau,
is involved in an auto accident.

470
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,145
And the mother, Fannie Romey,
doesn't like the way

471
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,920
that the city chief of police
handled the investigation.

472
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:22,960
And so she contacts
the chief of police.

473
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,225
She calls him a liar.

474
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,525
Back then,
you didn't call

475
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,290
the chief of police
in any Florida city a liar.

476
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,535
Okay.
So what happens next?

477
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,735
Well, Steve,
on May 17, 1929,

478
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,735
the chief of police goes to
the Romeys' store,

479
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,840
with two of his men and also
one of Sheriff Douglass' men.

480
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,075
Okay.

481
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,180
But Douglass is not at the scene
when this all goes down.

482
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:46,245
That's correct.

483
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,180
All right, so when they show up,
what happens?

484
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,867
There's
a huge altercation.

485
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,485
They actually take
Mr. Romey,

486
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,215
and they actually
pistol-whip him.

487
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,305
And he's knocked unconscious.
He's on the ground.

488
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,360
At that point, Mrs. Romey
comes into the store.

489
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:00,725
She panics.

490
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,500
She grabs a pistol the family
has kept as shopkeepers.

491
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:06,317
And she actually
shoots the chief,

492
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,065
wounds him,
not seriously.

493
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,040
Then the police return fire.
She's killed.

494
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,400
And at that time,

495
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,670
the police didn't know this,
but she actually was pregnant.

496
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,395
Geez.
All right.

497
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,075
And so at that point,

498
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,910
the police pull her husband,
Mr. Romey,

499
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,380
Nola Romey,
out of the store.

500
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,290
They pull the son, Esau,
out of the store, as well.

501
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:31,055
They actually bring them
to separate jails.

502
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,290
Later that evening, a mob
comes to the city jail.

503
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,295
They abduct Mr. Romey.

504
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,365
They take him
out of the jail.

505
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,465
They shoot him 13 times,
murder him.

506
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,670
These were some articles
I found on the case.

507
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,240
Even though he wasn't
at either one

508
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:50,275
of these crime scenes,

509
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,845
his culpability is --
is pretty high.

510
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,080
And, got away
with, basically, murder.

511
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,245
So after all is said and done,
is,

512
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,720
Babe still on my clients'
property at this point?

513
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,987
He is on
your clients' property

514
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:04,185
until the day he dies
in 1947.

515
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,655
And at that point,
he is 61 years old.

516
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,090
He goes out in his car.
He's driving.

517
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,960
He has a heart attack
and dies.

518
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:11,960
Okay.

519
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,970
I'm seeing
that red-orange thing again.

520
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:21,305
He's, like, really racist,

521
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,680
which is weird
'cause he's, like, not human.

522
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:27,317
Who is it racist towards?

523
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,920
I think really everybody.

524
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,320
This thing,
he gloats about how,

525
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,925
when he first came here,

526
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,130
he was able to influence
and manipulate men.

527
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,200
He would, like, do ****
to people.

528
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,870
Like, cause them to turn
against each other, death,

529
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,240
fighting and --
and all this kind of bad ****

530
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,165
mostly people
killing other people.

531
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
But he had
a great success rate.

532
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,760
You know, one other thing caught
my attention in research --

533
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:11,555
A woman who used to live
on the property

534
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,225
died in a fire
right on Regina and John's land.

535
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,825
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

536
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,030
who says that tragedy could
have been easily prevented.

537
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,605
Why'd you bring me here?

538
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,870
This house is very similar
to the house

539
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,110
that Louisa Smith Markham
lived in

540
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:32,045
when she died
from the fire.

541
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,580
What about the fire?
What happened?

542
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:36,545
So in 1886,
Louisa, um,

543
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,420
was taking care of the youngest
child, who was Elton.

544
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:42,820
He was severely ill,
had, a real bad cold.

545
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,720
So she bundled him up
and was --

546
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,030
was sitting at the rocking chair
in front of the fire.

547
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:51,900
Well, her nightgown
caught on fire.

548
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:55,030
And as that occurred,

549
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,770
the first instinct
of a mother, of course,

550
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:57,987
is to save the child.

551
00:24:58,022 --> 00:24:59,135
Right.
Which she did.

552
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,540
She got Elton
away from her.

553
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:02,905
And by that time,

554
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,745
she was completely engulfed
in flames, screaming.

555
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,980
The house is very small.
Everybody would have seen it.

556
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:10,085
It was so tragic

557
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
because the children
would have seen her die.

558
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,550
How old was she
when she died?

559
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,450
She was 32.

560
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,790
They're lucky that the whole
house didn't burn down.

561
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:20,560
So she was a hero, really.
She saved the kid.

562
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:21,360
Right.

563
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,620
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk.

564
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,840
But what really concerned me
was the angry man

565
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,827
attacking a living woman.

566
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:40,780
He was an elderly man...

567
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:43,385
pretty much bald.

568
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,785
He has, like, a big belly.

569
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,360
He was, like, pushing her head
into the wall.

570
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Was this what you saw?

571
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:00,670
Yes.

572
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,970
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

573
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:24,235
we're ready
to reveal our findings

574
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,140
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

575
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,350
Amy, I want you to meet
Regina and her husband, John.

576
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:34,515
Now, here's the issue --
Regina can't have children.

577
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,585
So she's always filled the house
here with nieces and nephews.

578
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,620
But the activity's gotten so
violent, they won't come over.

579
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,390
And Regina doesn't even
know if it's safe

580
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,225
for<i> them</i> to live here.

581
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,830
So with that being said,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

582
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:50,770
and have her talk
about her walk.

583
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,055
When I first arrived,

584
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,475
I saw this being outside.

585
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,615
And it's very
strange-looking, very tall.

586
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,350
And it was also --
The color of it was interesting

587
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:10,050
because it was kind of
like a reddish orange.

588
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:14,955
This entity cannot get
into the house.

589
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,630
To him, or to<i> it,</i>
something or somebody

590
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:20,360
put up a barrier
around this property

591
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:22,960
that is keeping him out.

592
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,600
And because of that,
he's become very obsessed

593
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:31,010
and fixated
on finding a way in.

594
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:32,670
I saged the house.

595
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,445
Okay.

596
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
I salted the yard.

597
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,410
Now, would that be
what's keeping him out?

598
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,880
Yes, so, then,
more than likely,

599
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:39,810
that's probably
the barrier

600
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,355
that is keeping
him at bay.

601
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,960
Even though he can't get
into the home,

602
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,495
he can follow you
off of the property.

603
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,700
I saw him get into a vehicle
with a living person.

604
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:58,252
And when
he travels with you,

605
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,228
he kind of
shrinks himself down

606
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,166
so he has little arms,
little legs.

607
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,405
But they're
very, like, strong.

608
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,575
My concern
with him doing that is

609
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,680
that he could cause you
to have a car accident.

610
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:11,397
Well,
that's pretty interesting.

611
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,656
We got a lot
to discuss now.

612
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,880
Why don't you
tell Amy, Regina,

613
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,050
about the shadow figure
that rushed you outside?

614
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,660
There was a dark,
6- footish figure,

615
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:23,912
black, black, black.

616
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:25,130
And it charged at me.

617
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm like, "No.

618
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:28,612
Go away."

619
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,335
And it vanished.

620
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,565
Now, Regina has a problem

621
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,700
where she actually sleeps facing
the wall because...

622
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,940
'Cause I feel
like I'm being watched.

623
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:41,362
that could be him.

624
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,715
He's ob-- obsessed.

625
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,845
What's unusual
about<i> it</i> was

626
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,785
that there was no recollection
of where he originated from.

627
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,690
He stated that he's never
been human, <i> ever.</i>

628
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,230
Even though he's never
been human, he's a racist.

629
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:05,930
I'm not exactly certain
what it is.

630
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,970
Um, but I would say,
you know,

631
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,510
possibly a demon.

632
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:11,370
Not good.

633
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,770
I thought
it was evil.

634
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,775
It was dark,
very dark.

635
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,515
He was saying that he was able
to influence men

636
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,220
to kill one another
and wants that to continue.

637
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:24,620
But he's a racist
in general.

638
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,250
Yes.

639
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,420
A lot of what you're saying
makes me think about a man

640
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,960
that actually lived
on your property

641
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,390
from the '20s to the '40s.

642
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,165
And his name was
Wiley Douglass.

643
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,885
Everybody knew him
as "Babe."

644
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,570
I actually got
a photo of him.

645
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,900
He became
the county sheriff.

646
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,640
And in 1929,
there was a Syrian family

647
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,910
in town
known as the Romey family

648
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:49,010
that ran a grocery store.

649
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:51,015
It was real nearby.

650
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,110
Now, the kid
of the family

651
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,715
got into some kind
of a car accident.

652
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,880
And they didn't like the way
the police handled it.

653
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,950
So now, the mom, Fannie,
calls the chief of police

654
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
to complain about
how they handled things.

655
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,925
And she basically
called him a liar.

656
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,630
Well, that didn't sit too well
with the guys.

657
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:06,595
On May 17, 1929,

658
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,260
the police chief,
two deputies

659
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,770
and one of the sheriff's
deputies go to the store.

660
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:12,630
So now, when the cops
entered the location,

661
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,725
they pistol-whipped
the dad, Nola,

662
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,775
and knocked him out
to the ground.

663
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,540
The mom, Fannie, saw her husband
lying on the ground,

664
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:20,745
thought he was dead.

665
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,410
She picked up the gun
they kept in the store.

666
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,410
And she
shot at the police.

667
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,980
The police returned fire
and killed her.

668
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,950
Now, this is
where it gets really screwed-up.

669
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,875
The son and Nola were arrested
and brought to separate jails.

670
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,790
Now get this -- That night,
a mob comes in, drags out Nola.

671
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,595
And they shot him
13 times.

672
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,600
And then they dumped his body
in some farm,

673
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,670
wind up making
national news.

674
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,570
So, now, could any of that,
what happened,

675
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,380
had to do with
this red-orange guy outside?

676
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,875
I do believe that,

677
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,250
more than likely,
he influenced the cop

678
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:00,515
to make poor decisions

679
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,280
and cause
the deaths of others.

680
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,125
So, what else
did you see?

681
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,560
The next person that I met
was an interesting character.

682
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:18,470
She, looks to be,
in her 50s.

683
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:19,730
She's trying to leave.

684
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,435
But a female here
keeps pulling her back.

685
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,540
She said that she's getting
called directly by name.

686
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:27,945
She said it's torturous,

687
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,880
and she's furious about it
because she wants to leave.

688
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:34,015
And she said to me

689
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,090
that she goes
into the female's dreams

690
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,085
and gives
this female nightmares.

691
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,260
And she is talking to her
in the dreams,

692
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:44,547
saying, "Let me go.

693
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:46,765
Let me go.
Let me go."

694
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,330
Well, you're the only female
that lives in the house.

695
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,595
Right. I have
different bad dreams.

696
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,630
I've<i> always</i>
had bad dreams, though.

697
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,740
It's because you're,
more than likely, a medium.

698
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,140
I've always been able
to hear things

699
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:02,240
and see things

700
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,310
and talk to things
that's not there.

701
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,185
Yeah.
That makes sense.

702
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:13,450
This dead woman, she also
is capable of slamming doors.

703
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,325
She also has a fixation
in the kitchen.

704
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,690
She showed me her slamming
the oven door and banging it.

705
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,095
Now, John,

706
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,130
you talked to me about noises
you heard in the kitchen, right?

707
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:24,165
Yes.

708
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,020
I get done with the dishes
and stuff.

709
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:27,697
And I'll come back
out here and sit.

710
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:29,340
And it sound
like somebody's in there,

711
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,875
messing with
the dishes.

712
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,640
You think that's
the woman doing that?

713
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:35,140
I think so.

714
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,440
Now, did you get any idea

715
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,800
who this woman
might have been in life?

716
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:41,115
I think she might have lived
in this house.

717
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,450
She showed me images
of her cooking and cleaning

718
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:44,602
all the time.

719
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:45,685
And I sensed

720
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,920
that someone in this house
knew about her dying.

721
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,260
But she wouldn't talk to me
about her death at all.

722
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:55,495
She kept blocking me
from seeing it.

723
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,130
It's time we tell Amy
about the 1,000-pound gorilla

724
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,765
in the room.

725
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,705
John's mother, Becky,

726
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,370
was murdered right over there,
in that corner.

727
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,375
My goodness.

728
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,840
To make things worse,

729
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,080
the murderer was her brother,
John's Uncle Jack.

730
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,515
Got it.

731
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,785
Now, it happened
on September 19, 2005.

732
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,460
That night, John's mom
was sitting in a chair

733
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:23,055
right there

734
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,995
when his Uncle Jack
came up this hallway.

735
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,500
He put two bullets
in her head and killed her.

736
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:31,735
He went halfway
down this hallway here,

737
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,530
put the gun in his mouth,
and shot himself in the head

738
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,840
and killed himself.

739
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,335
My gosh.

740
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,570
John's mom, she was 59 years old
at the time she died.

741
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,380
Tell Amy about your mom,
what kind of woman she was.

742
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,610
Very headstrong,

743
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,950
where if it wasn't her way,
it was the highway.

744
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,115
She'd get mad.

745
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,690
At the snap of a finger,
she'd get mad at anything.

746
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,820
Your uncle, was he ever
in the military?

747
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,790
Yes, he was.
He was in the Army.

748
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,142
He was
a helicopter pilot.

749
00:33:58,177 --> 00:33:59,460
And he was
shot down twice.

750
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,962
My God.

751
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,395
Okay. Got it.

752
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,240
It sounds like you might have
seen Becky, John's mom.

753
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:08,500
I have a picture of Becky.

754
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,570
Okay. Yeah.
Let me see her.

755
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,370
This is Becky.

756
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,510
Yeah.
That's who I saw.

757
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,715
I just don't want her
to be stuck here.

758
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,920
Regina's accidentally
trapping her here, though.

759
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,115
Yes.

760
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,750
Which happens to a lot
of mediums that I meet.

761
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:29,390
We like to have
dead people around us.

762
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,245
So, then I met
another person.

763
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,460
And it was
in the laundry room.

764
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:42,700
When I walked in there, I felt
that a living person, female,

765
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:48,630
was being violently attacked
by an older, deceased male.

766
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:53,677
And to me, it was so intense,
it nearly killed this person.

767
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:58,690
And I think the living person
was, pushed to the ground.

768
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:03,077
I saw, like,
a pane of glass, um,

769
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:07,395
break and shatter
onto my head.

770
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,030
You know, everybody's getting
attacked here.

771
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:14,067
I was standing,
looking out the window.

772
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:17,070
And it felt
like something pushed me,

773
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:18,275
the middle part
of my leg.

774
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,140
And I fell forward
into the four panes of glass

775
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,180
and broke the glass.

776
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,980
He's lucky
he didn't cut his wrist open.

777
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,245
Right.

778
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,435
The other night,
I was in there,

779
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,260
taking stuff
out of the dryer.

780
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,050
And it felt
like somebody took

781
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,290
either a very narrow knife
or a sharp blade...

782
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,890
...and hit me
right back here.

783
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,125
I felt it here.

784
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,370
And I could feel it
<i>through</i> my skin.

785
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:48,140
I had a sketch done
of the attack I saw.

786
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,070
Should be interesting.

787
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,550
I'm sorry, guys,
to even show you this.

788
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,390
What are you thinking
when you see this?

789
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,395
Jack.

790
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,390
You're thinking
of your Uncle Jack?

791
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,300
That's why
I turned away.

792
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:15,365
I know you did.

793
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,670
I don't need to see it.
I don't wanna see it.

794
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:19,030
Can we take him
off the table?

795
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
Yeah.
We'll take him off.

796
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,935
There we go.

797
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,170
Did you get anything
about this guy in life?

798
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,970
Yes, I did.

799
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,205
Let's talk about that

800
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,745
before we go
jumping the gun.

801
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,780
I got that this male
has extreme issues.

802
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,745
He's incredibly angry.

803
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,815
He was a very tough guy
in life.

804
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,520
I got that he had a heart attack
at some point.

805
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:43,190
I got that there was
something extremely wrong

806
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:45,625
with his hips and legs.

807
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,030
It hurt so freaking bad, it felt
like there was fire shooting

808
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,700
through my legs
and into my hips.

809
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:54,835
I got
that he was in a war

810
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,610
and that he had suffered
injuries from that war.

811
00:36:57,645 --> 00:37:00,005
I got that he lived
and died here

812
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,410
and that he was extremely
territorial about this house.

813
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:06,312
He didn't want me
or anybody else here.

814
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:09,180
Well, remember when I told you
about John's mom

815
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,705
being killed
by her own brother?

816
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,185
Okay.
Now, his name was Jack.

817
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,075
He had a ton of issues,
both mental and physical.

818
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,930
He was a helicopter pilot
in the Vietnam War.

819
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,895
He was shot down twice.

820
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,165
John believes
he suffered from PTSD.

821
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,635
He was also
a<i> physical</i> wreck, though.

822
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,100
He suffered from Parkinson's
and walked with a walker.

823
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,735
Okay. Got it.

824
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,875
Now, you mentioned before

825
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,540
that you thought he had
a heart attack.

826
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:33,570
Yes.

827
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,745
He<i> did</i> have
a heart attack.

828
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,550
And that's why John's mom
told him to move in here,

829
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,610
so she could
take care of him.

830
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,380
Now, the family thinks
there's a couple of reasons

831
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:42,980
that he might have snapped.

832
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,850
PTSD was the main reason.

833
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,520
Through the fact
that their mother, Dorothy,

834
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,490
was giving the house to Becky
and not to Jack.

835
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,760
The territorial.

836
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:54,925
Okay. Yeah.

837
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,400
Do you have any doubts
that it could be him?

838
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,217
No.

839
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:58,965
Okay.

840
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,265
Absolutely not.

841
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
<i>Absolutely</i> not.

842
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,490
Why is he being
so violent?

843
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,940
He still wants
the house.

844
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
He wants this for<i> him.</i>

845
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
He coulda killed you.

846
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:14,620
Yes, he could have.

847
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,020
So, John,
your family lived here.

848
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,155
They died here.

849
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,500
And, apparently,
they're<i> still</i> here.

850
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,195
Question is,
how can we move them on

851
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,930
and take care of this thing
outside and to get your lives

852
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:50,540
back to where there's children
in this house again?

853
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,340
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

854
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,975
I do think

855
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:06,220
that thing outside is
a...agent of chaos.

856
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:08,937
I think
he may have influenced

857
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,620
what happened
in your family.

858
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,825
That being said,
I'm very happy

859
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,600
that you had the insight
and wherewithal

860
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,160
to put down that salt.

861
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,835
But this sucker
is tenacious.

862
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,690
And he<i> will</i> get in
eventually.

863
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:27,510
The first thing
that needs to be done

864
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,705
is the removal
of the dead.

865
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,240
A medium needs
to come into the home.

866
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,950
On the first visit, the medium
needs to take care of the dead

867
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:38,250
that you don't know.

868
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,185
Okay.

869
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,550
The second visit
is going to be

870
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,975
to assist your mother,
um, to move on,

871
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,390
and then,
once that's been completed,

872
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,525
to move on
to your uncle.

873
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,015
I need for you to recall
two really good memories

874
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:01,470
about your uncle
and give those to the medium

875
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:04,392
because it's only
through those memories

876
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:07,280
that she'll be able
to reach<i> him.</i>

877
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:09,750
Now, this is
very important.

878
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,420
Okay.

879
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,145
Hold on for a second.

880
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,340
You seem
a little shocked.

881
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,100
I think he is.

882
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,640
- You okay to let go?
- Yes.

883
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:35,705
Okay.

884
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,480
'Cause you don't want them
to be here.

885
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:40,080
You want her to...
Move on.

886
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:41,715
Okay. Good.

887
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,645
The entity is next.

888
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,320
What needs to be done
with that situation

889
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:50,425
is a priest
needs to come,

890
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,310
needs to exorcise
the outside of your house

891
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:58,125
and then do a blessing
outside of your home.

892
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,100
It's going to keep
<i>all</i> negativity out forever.

893
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,935
So, once all these steps
are done,

894
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,725
they should feel a difference
in the house, right?

895
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,480
Yeah. You'll feel
a substantial difference.

896
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,380
This is
pretty freaking good news.

897
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:14,815
Definitely.

898
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,220
We can have the kids
to come over and play, you know?

899
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,585
I'm glad you guys
called us in.

900
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,090
You know, it broke my heart
listening to your story.

901
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,560
But now you can go from
the house of basically the dead

902
00:41:26,595 --> 00:41:29,530
to the house of a happy,
living family.

903
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:30,295
Yeah.

904
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,400
I cannot imagine the pain
John and Regina feel

905
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:37,540
knowing they have
deceased family members

906
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,635
inside their home.

907
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,510
But I believe
if they follow my advice,

908
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:42,775
they can set them free

909
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,240
and banish the demon outside
forever.
