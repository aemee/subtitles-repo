1
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:11,778
Nobody's at rest here.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,848
The living aren't. The dead aren't.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,686
One evening, two hands
grabbed me real hard. Bam!

4
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,757
All I heard was, "He is a murderer."

5
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,892
She just got attacked.

6
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,960
He tells me they should get out
of here as quick as possible.

7
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:29,663
I feel like this is
coming straight from Hell.

8
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:34,303
Unfortunately, this
is not a happy place.

9
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:37,138
I just hear death.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,739
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,472
God.

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,608
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,709
I see dead people.

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,910
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,645
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,347
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

17
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,916
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,417
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

19
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,487
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,422
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,057
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,559
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,361
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,795
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

25
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,065
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,066
They're everywhere.

27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,636
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,804
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

29
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:14,506
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,642
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,709
...until the very end...

32
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,477
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,212
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,214
That's it.

35
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,651
...or time to get out.

36
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:29,056
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

37
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,306
I'm in the small town
of Gates, North Carolina.

38
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,908
It's about an hour
south of Virginia Beach.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,577
I got a call from a woman
who was in hysterics.

40
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,946
She says she has a
17-year-old daughter

41
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,414
whose life is in danger,

42
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,084
and she has absolutely no
idea how to protect her.

43
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,887
She sounded horrible on the phone.

44
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,221
She broke my heart

45
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,758
and said Amy and I are her last hope.

46
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,666
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:15,168
I have to clear the area

48
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,006
of anything that could
influence her findings.

49
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,542
Spiritual items, photographs,
and religious texts

50
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,412
have to be covered or removed.

51
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:29,484
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

52
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,462
There's some problems here.

53
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,597
There's a lot of anger here.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,734
The living here, I just
feel like this anger,

55
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,175
it's really deconstructing their lives.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,114
This place is not good.
It makes me feel horrible.

57
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,484
Some of the living here

58
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,787
don't know what's real and what's not.

59
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,789
Was that a dream or
not? Am I awake or not?

60
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,559
Did I see that or not?
Nothing makes sense.

61
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:16,394
I don't like it. It makes my head spin.

62
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,464
Oy.

63
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,469
I literally feel like I'm spinning.

64
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,880
So, Deborah, I'm glad I'm here

65
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,313
'cause when we spoke,

66
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,882
you sounded pretty
terrified on the phone.

67
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,216
Do me a favor.

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,952
Just give an idea of what's going on.

69
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:43,388
Hearing voices, getting
things thrown at you.

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,424
Seeing some shadow people.

71
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:49,095
And physically violent at this point.

72
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,363
It's attacking my daughter.

73
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,833
I don't feel like she's
safe here any longer.

74
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:57,272
The physical attacks on Nikki,
what are we talking about?

75
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,642
And just a couple of weeks ago,

76
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,811
she... she was sexually touched.

77
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,880
That kills me.

78
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,151
I feel like this is
coming straight from Hell.

79
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,521
And I don't know how to fight it.

80
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,756
Is it just you and Nikki that live here?

81
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,727
No. My husband, as well.

82
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:24,362
Nikki, she's sleeping
in my room at this point

83
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,898
and has been for a year.

84
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,570
My husband, Jeff, he's been
moved to the spare bedroom.

85
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:32,871
How's that working on your marriage?

86
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,974
Ä°t can be hard at times.
I'm not gonna deny that.

87
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,575
You know, for
a 17-year-old

88
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,078
to be sleeping with
her mom at this point,

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,481
it's a little... it's a little strange.

90
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:46,488
It is. Um... but she is so terrified.

91
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,155
I'm... I'm afraid...

92
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,194
I'm... I'm afraid it's gonna take her.

93
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:00,099
I've seen the markings around her neck.

94
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,602
What if I'm not there one of those times

95
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:06,205
that the thing decides to attack her?

96
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,705
That's why I called you guys.

97
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,907
I'm at my wits' end at this point.

98
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,710
I need help, and I need big help.

99
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,412
Let's get some basics out of the way.

100
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,114
How long have you guys been living here?

101
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,982
We moved here in 2011.

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,753
My father, he was diagnosed
with cirrhosis of the liver

103
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,388
and died of liver failure.

104
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,958
He was a constant alcoholic.

105
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,895
I made the choice to be closer.
And that's why I moved here.

106
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,698
When did he die?

107
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,299
In December 2012.

108
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,667
All right. And how old
was he when he died?

109
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,169
He was 62.

110
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,671
What kind of guy was he?

111
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:44,309
Well, this man was loving, caring

112
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,544
but very strict at the same time.

113
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,515
He liked everything cleaned,
everything put in a spot.

114
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,883
Everything had its home.

115
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,854
He would get my mom to walk
around with a white glove

116
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:58,556
to test the dust on our
beds and our dressers.

117
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,258
Do you think your father's here?

118
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,497
Yes. I know he's here.

119
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,302
There's a dead guy

120
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,741
that is really physically present.

121
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:21,112
He looks 50s, like late 50s, early 60s.

122
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,948
And he's very fussy.

123
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,253
Almost, like, neurotic,
like with touching people.

124
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:30,054
Yeah, like a weird fixation for him.

125
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,056
Because of him,

126
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,727
I'm having these,
obsessive thoughts.

127
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,462
Living people here

128
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,931
would have, um, some
pretty bad OCD problems.

129
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,566
And he feels recent.

130
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,936
He was sick. Sick, sick, sick.

131
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,607
He's kind of a disaster.

132
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,212
Deborah, what's going on in the kitchen?

133
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,116
In here, we have
experienced cold spells.

134
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,618
It feels like a good 10-degree drop.

135
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,222
And it feels like when
they are around you,

136
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,092
they feel like they just
drain energy from you.

137
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,559
Like, instantly, you get very tired.

138
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,229
I'm gonna ask you a
silly question, though.

139
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,063
Are you going through any
kind of menopause or anything?

140
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,164
Hell yeah, I am.

141
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,433
But it's... that's...

142
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,234
That's a totally different feeling.

143
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,438
This is not the same.

144
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:23,075
I feel it staring at me
and watching my every move.

145
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,943
And it's like an evil presence.

146
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,414
It does not want me around.

147
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,719
I'm also seeing this younger guy,

148
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,554
and he is a freak.

149
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,525
He grabs people.

150
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,128
When he touches people,
they get like a...

151
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,530
They actually get, like,
the cold chill thing.

152
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,499
And when he touched my shoulder,

153
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,102
it just felt, like, icy cold.

154
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,140
So the younger dude, right?
When he first shows up, right?

155
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,213
He says, "I want to kill things."

156
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,114
He's very angry, this guy.

157
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,016
And then this dead lady shows up,

158
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,119
and she is all over him,

159
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,789
like, trying to be all
lovey-dovey and ****

160
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,025
But he doesn't want
nothing to do with her.

161
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,225
He doesn't want her there.

162
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,960
And he's livid.

163
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,030
And I just feel like

164
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:22,200
it's really taking a
toll on these people.

165
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:29,342
It's like they never
get a moment of... peace.

166
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:30,178
Ever.

167
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:38,551
So this is the master bedroom
where you and Nikki sleep?

168
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:40,952
It's the worst room,
for me, in this house.

169
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,821
I can't sleep.

170
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,388
One evening, I was laying here

171
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,425
in the bed with my daughter, Nikki.

172
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,662
All of a sudden, it just felt
like two hands grabbed me...

173
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,464
one on this side, one on this side...

174
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,399
and real hard, up against the bedpost.

175
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,268
At the same time. Bam!

176
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,071
And at the same time this was going on,

177
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,874
I'm feeling a third hand.

178
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,377
And it feels like a man's
hand grabbing me by my throat

179
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,080
and just kind of like pulling my neck up

180
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,348
and choking me at the same time.

181
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,182
And so how long did it last?

182
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,618
About 2 or 3 minutes.

183
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,820
I felt like I was
getting ready to pass out.

184
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:18,290
And my daughter, she
immediately jumps out of bed

185
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,292
and she's grabbing Bibles
and she's praying over me

186
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,696
at the same time all this is happening.

187
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:26,098
I'm afraid to even ask you
if there's anything else.

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,566
And there is.

189
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,234
And I drifted off to sleep,

190
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,273
and I'm wakened by a finger... fingers.

191
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,344
Went from here and they go slowly.

192
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,747
And they kept coming.
And they kept coming.

193
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,749
And they kept coming
until it reached my breast.

194
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:49,522
And I tried to jump up,

195
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:52,423
but the covers, they
got real, real tight.

196
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,027
Real tight. I couldn't
get out of my covers.

197
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,095
I can't push it off. I can't shoot it.

198
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,199
And all I felt was the hand... the hand.

199
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,768
I was violated.

200
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,904
I've
never told nobody this.

201
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,706
All right. It's okay.

202
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,009
I'm sorry. You're okay?

203
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,144
It's just so much.

204
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,349
I know, baby. I know, babe.

205
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:28,125
This is more where, like,
that man and woman are.

206
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,195
So what does this guy do to people?

207
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,096
He's capable of touching, grabbing.

208
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,233
Anybody in particular that he targets?

209
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,969
Well, I think females.
I think he's about that.

210
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,671
And he wants to kill people.

211
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:39,939
Is that what he's trying to do?

212
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,242
Yeah.

213
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:50,648
God! Stop! Stop! Stop!

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,783
Leave her alone!

215
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,921
After interviewing Deborah,
I stepped away for a second.

216
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,023
And that's when I heard
screaming and crying

217
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,291
coming from her room.

218
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:02,594
Stop! It's my daughter, not yours!

219
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,662
You have no right to touch her!

220
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,332
I rushed over, and all I can say is

221
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,469
I've never seen anything like this.

222
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,811
She just got attacked.

223
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,680
It started on her back
first, just scratching.

224
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,481
And then it grabbed
her again by the neck.

225
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,318
Geez. Look at that.

226
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,787
You can see the welts.

227
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,505
- What happened?
- She just got attacked.

228
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,341
It started on her back
first, just scratching.

229
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,043
And then it grabbed
her again by the neck.

230
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,214
Geez. Look at that.

231
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,248
You can see the welts.

232
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,350
I feel really helpless.

233
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,585
Whatever's here can go to Hell.

234
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,532
So, how are you doing? You're
doing better from before?

235
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,002
I was able to get some rest,

236
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,436
and I'm doing a little bit better.

237
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,340
- That happens a lot to you, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

238
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:24,176
Okay. Well, you're the
reason Mom called us in.

239
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,944
She thinks you're in danger.

240
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,779
Do you feel the same way, that
you're in deep danger here?

241
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,181
At times, I really do.

242
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,518
I'm scared for my family.

243
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,619
Okay.

244
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,055
I want to talk about all the
experiences you're having.

245
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,223
What's going on?

246
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,425
I'd get scratched.

247
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,158
Like, earlier today, I was,

248
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,461
and I would get scratched in the shower.

249
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,763
I'd feel these burning sensations.

250
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,098
And then I'd look down,

251
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,700
and I have scratches all over me.

252
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,469
Now, what do these
scratches exactly look like?

253
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,670
Are they long?

254
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:55,343
Actually, these are
what it can look like.

255
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,680
Geez.

256
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,349
So it's almost exactly
like what I saw before?

257
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,450
Yes.

258
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,219
You're not doing this
to yourself, are you?

259
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,954
- No, I'm not.
- Look at me.

260
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,723
I'm not doing this to myself.

261
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,791
I
wouldn't do this to myself.

262
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,994
Okay. 'Cause sometimes people
do things to get attention.

263
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,330
Yeah, I know.

264
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,399
Are you getting touched any other way?

265
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,700
Yeah.

266
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,769
Um, I had been sleeping
out on the couch,

267
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:30,642
and I started feeling like
something just touched me,

268
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,710
just like that,

269
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,581
and then go all the way down my body.

270
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,148
It got sexually inappropriate with you?

271
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,316
Yes. It just really freaked me out.

272
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,954
I've never been touched
like that before.

273
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:43,787
Okay. It's all right.

274
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,325
I feel like because of it
singling me out all the time,

275
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,297
maybe it has something to do with me.

276
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,433
The younger guy,

277
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,303
he stated that he would
like to be killing things.

278
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,373
Would the living in
here be aware of him?

279
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,307
Yeah, no, they're
aware. Yeah. Totally.

280
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,746
Um, maybe feeling, like, movement.

281
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,149
Hearing, like, mumbling,

282
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,218
feeling pressure on the bed,

283
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,122
like, when they're laying on the bed.

284
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,658
I don't trust him.

285
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,332
Jeff, I was talking to your wife,

286
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,634
and I understand this is
where you're sleeping now?

287
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,902
- Yeah.
- Okay.

288
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,437
I mean, that can't be
good for the marriage.

289
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,806
It is aggravating,
frustrating, you know,

290
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,042
that you just want to...

291
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,510
Right.

292
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,413
Well, earlier, I walked
away for a second.

293
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,449
I come back and your
daughter's getting attacked.

294
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,252
It's something I've never seen before.

295
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,154
It... it just seems to
go after, you know, women.

296
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,224
To me, that's weak and...

297
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,659
- Cowardice.
- Yeah, exactly.

298
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,928
So you consider yourself a skeptic?

299
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,965
No, not anymore.

300
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,867
So what changed your mind?

301
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,202
The time when I saw for myself.

302
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,904
There was a pot on the counter.

303
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,407
It actually went off of that

304
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,409
and onto the floor in the next room.

305
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,311
- You saw this happen?
- Yes.

306
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,946
How did you react when you saw that?

307
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,181
It got me pretty angry,

308
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,182
I mean, to the point
where I screamed at it,

309
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,984
"Come on, you coward, S.O.B.

310
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,619
Here I am. Take me."

311
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,455
Have you seen anything else like that?

312
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,191
I've seen, like, shadow figures

313
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,494
out of the corner of my eye.

314
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:30,095
In which part of the house?

315
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,797
Usually right around between
the bedroom I'm in now

316
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,066
and my daughter's room.

317
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,867
- Okay, so right here basically?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,036
Could you tell if it
was a male or a female?

319
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,771
- Male.
- Okay.

320
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,806
I got to ask you a question
as a husband and a father.

321
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,508
Do you think the girls are in danger?

322
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,711
I don't really want to admit
it, but they are getting harmed.

323
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,748
I want to protect them.

324
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,816
I never thought I'd
ever be in a situation

325
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,051
that I wouldn't be able to.

326
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,289
And I don't know what to do.

327
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:04,363
That old fussy man, the
OCD man, he's in here a lot.

328
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:09,167
He's... He tells me, "I'm
trying to wake them up.

329
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,970
Wake up! Wake up!"

330
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,370
Wake who up?

331
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,941
I see...

332
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:17,776
I think it... I think it's a male,

333
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,912
probably in his 30s or 40s,

334
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:24,284
waking up because he is
hearing, "Wake up! Wake up!"

335
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,721
The dead OCD man is
trying to help this person.

336
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,825
He's trying to warn.

337
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,194
He's trying to give a warning.

338
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,960
About what?

339
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,598
Everything in this house.

340
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,566
I think that this person

341
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,936
is probably the most sensitive
person in the household,

342
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,104
and because of that,

343
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,040
is being severely affected by this.

344
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,609
He's very depressed.

345
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,711
He's trying to tell them

346
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:57,150
they probably should get out
of here as quickly as possible.

347
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,949
So one of the first things
I do when I start an investigation

348
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,982
is reach out to the local
cops, reporters, and historians.

349
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:16,350
I just got a call
back from a genealogist

350
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:19,088
who says she might be able to help.

351
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,723
Turns out,

352
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,625
one of the original owners
of Deborah and Jeff's property

353
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:24,796
had a real tragic time there.

354
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,799
Now, you mentioned on the phone

355
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,636
one of the original owners of
the property I'm investigating

356
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,838
had a pretty tough time
while they were there.

357
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,307
But before we get to that,
though, who was this guy?

358
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,942
His name was Mills H. Eure.

359
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:44,713
He got the land in 1840,
inherited from his grandmother.

360
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:48,050
Okay, so the land he inherits.
What kind of land is it?

361
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,453
- It was most likely farmland.
- Okay.

362
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,054
Most likely a plantation.

363
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:58,926
And the 1860 census we do have,
where Mills owned 11 slaves.

364
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,397
Now, Cathy, you mentioned on the phone

365
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,165
that there was tragedy with this family.

366
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,466
What was the story?

367
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,935
Well, Mills married in the early 1840s

368
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,604
to a Miss Williams.

369
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:13,175
They had a little girl in 1845.

370
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,512
And by 1850, the mother was dead.

371
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:17,612
Do we know what she died of?

372
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:18,847
We do not.

373
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,249
North Carolina did not
require death records

374
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,385
at that point in time.

375
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:24,185
Does he ever remarry?

376
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,620
He does.

377
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:31,527
He married in 1853 to
Sarah Louisa Savage.

378
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:34,562
She was 18. He was 32.

379
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,999
And then tragedy hits him again

380
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:39,568
because the second wife died in 1859.

381
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,203
She was dead by 24.

382
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,369
What does she die of?

383
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,606
Again, we don't know.

384
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:45,307
All right. So I'm afraid to even ask.

385
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,809
Did this guy ever get married again?

386
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,010
No, he did not.

387
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:50,979
He remained single for
the rest of his life.

388
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,981
Well, this is pretty good information.

389
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:55,384
I don't know how it's gonna
help in the investigation,

390
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,818
but it's interesting

391
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,754
how this poor guy lost two
wives pretty young in life.

392
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,357
I do have something
else that might help you.

393
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,328
His only son died in a very tragic way.

394
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,663
What happened?

395
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:10,299
He apparently was an alcoholic.

396
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:14,503
He went on a 10-day bender,
and he was firing his pistol.

397
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,570
People were running left and right,

398
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,506
trying to get out of his way.

399
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:21,676
He came upon a local
merchant, Edward Gatlin,

400
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:24,245
and told him he was going to kill him.

401
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,514
Okay.

402
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,849
Gatlin managed to reach his gun first

403
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,554
and fired and shot
young Mills in the back.

404
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:35,456
We have a newspaper article
that talks about that.

405
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,096
Mills lingered on and died 2 days later.

406
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:47,468
This guy was, like,
super psycho when he was alive.

407
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,804
The second I walked back outside,

408
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,407
the young dead guy is all over me.

409
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:55,711
And I'm starting to see he
was a violent man in life.

410
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:58,416
He's telling me he wants to kill things.

411
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,185
He probably wasn't the nicest dude.

412
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:05,389
He might've hurt people.

413
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,990
Nobody's at rest here.

414
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,259
The living aren't. The dead aren't.

415
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,261
It's hard.

416
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,965
So far, I know the
previous landowner Mills Eure

417
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,636
suffered one tragedy after another,

418
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,105
losing two wives at a very young age.

419
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,944
But I need to see if
there's anything more.

420
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,810
Searching through old
records, I find Thomas Pitman,

421
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,047
who purchased the land from Mills Eure.

422
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,582
Turns out Pitman also lost two wives

423
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,553
while living on the property.

424
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:42,724
Believe it or not, this guy's
granddaughter is still alive.

425
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:44,693
She's 96, feisty as hell,

426
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,998
and willing to talk
about her grandfather.

427
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:55,370
So your grandfather, you remember him?

428
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:57,939
- Now, how old
were you when he passed away?

429
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,307
Ten years old.

430
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,908
Now, I understand

431
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,779
your grandfather purchased
my client's property in 1882.

432
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:06,648
Yeah. But I wasn't around then.

433
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,383
I would hope not.

434
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,252
What kind of a man was he?

435
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:16,224
He was a good man, always
doing something for us.

436
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,560
I know that your grandfather's
first wife, Annie,

437
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,963
died in 1874,

438
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,197
but the records are
unclear as to how she died.

439
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,166
Do you have any idea?

440
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,502
It was diphtheria.

441
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,436
Now, I know your grandfather remarried

442
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,437
to a woman named Sally.

443
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,039
Sally died in 1891,

444
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,445
but I couldn't find any records
to tell me what she died of.

445
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:40,247
Okay, so she died from the same thing?

446
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,351
I know your grandfather
lost two wives at this point.

447
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,486
Did he remarry again?

448
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,290
Yes, he did, in 1894.

449
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,925
Stella, that's my grandmother.

450
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:54,631
That man on the end is my grandfather.

451
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,868
Now, do you know when he died?

452
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,774
He died one week after
his 80th birthday.

453
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:14,649
Unfortunately, this is
not, a happy place.

454
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,453
Like, I'm hearing that word "sorrow."

455
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:19,788
There's a lot of sorrow here.

456
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,960
A lot of sorrow, a lot
of pain, a lot of loss.

457
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,400
Boy.

458
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:36,605
There's something very wrong.

459
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,110
Nothing is as it seems here. Nothing.

460
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:43,648
It's pretty crazy.

461
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,386
If you need us to investigate

462
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:52,087
unexplained activity in your home,

463
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:54,990
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

464
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,259
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

465
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:58,162
and we'll help if we can.

466
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,604
Now, another thing that
caught my eye during research

467
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:11,506
was The Buffaloes, a deadly gang

468
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:13,408
that tore through town
and murdered a woman

469
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,042
right next door to my client's property.

470
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:17,545
I'm on my way to meet with a historian

471
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,347
who says that The Buffaloes

472
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,686
were cold-blooded killers and thieves.

473
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,522
So, Chris, I know a
lot about the Civil War

474
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:29,958
from research I've done.

475
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,493
But I never heard of The Buffaloes.

476
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,762
Buffaloes were a ragtag group of men.

477
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:36,397
This is a picture of
some Buffalo soldiers.

478
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:38,899
They were a wandering group

479
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,970
who were ex-Confederate soldiers,

480
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:43,839
runaway slaves, thieves.

481
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,141
I mean, biracial? I mean, 1860s? Really?

482
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,676
Very, very unusual.

483
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,744
All right. So what would these guys do?

484
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,514
Well, they went on a huge
crime spree in the area.

485
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,652
They would attack farms,
steal the people's property.

486
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,253
If they met any resistance,

487
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:00,957
they wouldn't hesitate
to kill the person.

488
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:06,027
There are men outside,

489
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,396
all different colors.

490
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:11,032
They seemed to be very agitated.

491
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,168
It seems like a very desolate place,

492
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,374
but I'm getting a lot
of wrongful deaths here.

493
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:20,945
That's how it feels with these men.

494
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,045
So now, I know they
attacked and killed a woman

495
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,281
that lived right next door
to my client's property.

496
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:27,950
Do you know anything about that?

497
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:30,118
Yes, her name was Mrs. Spivey.

498
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,355
On a raid in February 1865,
they attacked her house.

499
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,224
They took all of her belongings,

500
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:38,292
and then they wanted a
little something extra.

501
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:39,695
And she refused them,

502
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:42,397
and they summarily
shot and bayoneted her.

503
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,133
Okay.

504
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:45,599
On that same day,

505
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,702
they actually attacked
your client's property.

506
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,972
Okay, who was living there at the time?

507
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:51,041
Mills Eure.

508
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,076
I already came across
him in my research.

509
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:55,210
What happened?

510
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:58,079
They attacked, took all of his property,

511
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,050
and beat him up.

512
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:07,321
I see this woman, and
she's got long black hair.

513
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:08,956
I'm just, like, in her,

514
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:12,394
and I'm feeling a man grabbing me

515
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:15,066
and, like, slitting my throat.

516
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,266
Then he, like...

517
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,970
caved in basically half her face.

518
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:26,344
I felt, like, this horrible
pain in the right eye socket.

519
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:32,547
And then I hear lots of
women screaming and moaning.

520
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,550
And then, quickly, very
quickly, I see a male

521
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:39,253
who's dressed in very
dark blue with gold trim.

522
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:43,024
I've never seen any kind of
military dress like this before.

523
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:45,629
All I heard was, "He is a murderer."

524
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,964
All right. So did these
guys ever get caught,

525
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,800
or did they just get away with it?

526
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,368
Yes, they did get caught.

527
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,070
The Confederate Army came in,

528
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:58,307
attacked their base camp,
and captured 14 of these men.

529
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:01,943
Ten were returned as deserters
to their original unit,

530
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,579
but four of these men

531
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,681
were taken to Mrs.
Spivey's house and executed.

532
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,520
And here's a newspaper
account of that attack.

533
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,688
And what was the reason for
going back to the property?

534
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,625
To teach a lesson to any of
the other thieves in the area.

535
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,029
Okay.

536
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,701
I saw several
dead people on my walk,

537
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:29,404
but the young dead man
tormenting a living woman

538
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,473
had me the most concerned.

539
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:34,842
His face is all black.

540
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,479
Thin nose.

541
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,981
He had a weird kind of look.

542
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:44,588
He was standing on the bed
and touching her shoulder.

543
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,991
Is this what you saw?

544
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:52,029
Yes.

545
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:15,250
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

546
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:17,386
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

547
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,954
and our clients for the first time.

548
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:22,691
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Deborah, her husband, Jeff,

549
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,059
and their daughter, Nikki.

550
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,927
Now, I spent the day with the family

551
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:28,262
and got a firsthand look
at how bad things are.

552
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:29,830
And it was very disturbing.

553
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:32,634
Probably one of the most
serious cases we've ever done.

554
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:36,204
And the family's convinced
that whatever's going on

555
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,839
is going after Nikki.

556
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:42,077
And they'll do whatever
it takes to keep her safe.

557
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,977
Now that Amy knows

558
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:46,747
just a little bit about what
you guys are going through,

559
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,818
I'm gonna ask her to
describe the walk for us.

560
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,721
When I was outside,

561
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:56,224
I saw this woman that
was being murdered.

562
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:58,960
She was in her 20s or 30s.

563
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:01,162
She had long black hair.

564
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:03,898
And I suddenly felt like I
was kind of inside her body.

565
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,535
And a male came up and grabbed me

566
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,040
and slit my throat.

567
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:17,212
I felt horrible pain in my eye socket

568
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:19,080
and also my nose.

569
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,648
And then, I saw a male

570
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,252
who was wearing this really
strange military outfit.

571
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,954
And it was dark blue with gold.

572
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,256
And he kind of had a
strange hat, as well.

573
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,591
It was, like, more like a cowboy hat.

574
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:33,561
There were quite a few.

575
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,463
And they were all
different ages and races,

576
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,864
but they were all male.

577
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,333
Well, I think I can
help you out on this one.

578
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:40,835
Back in the 1860s,

579
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,070
there was a group of
outlaws called The Buffaloes.

580
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:45,307
The strange thing about
this group of men were

581
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,674
they were multiracial,

582
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,543
which was pretty odd
for the time period.

583
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,479
It was during the Civil War.

584
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,981
They were a gang made up

585
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,817
of ex-Civil War soldiers,
criminals, escaped slaves.

586
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,019
Wow.

587
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:58,686
I was actually able to get a photo.

588
00:28:58,688 --> 00:28:59,820
You mentioned the uniforms.

589
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,326
Yeah. How weird.

590
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:09,764
Now, in February of 1865,

591
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,399
they came onto your property

592
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:15,235
that was inhabited by a guy
named Mills Eure at the time.

593
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,704
I have an article here

594
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:19,174
that says how they
nearly beat him to death

595
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,575
and stole all his property.

596
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:22,577
Now, right after that happened,

597
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:25,681
they decided to go right
next door to your property

598
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,549
and attack a woman named Mrs. Spivey.

599
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:29,783
The historian I had spoke to

600
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,919
said they tried to rape
her after they robbed her.

601
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,221
She fought back,

602
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:36,957
and they wind up bayoneting
her and shooting her.

603
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:40,627
She died right in the property.

604
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,797
Now, 14 of these guys were caught.

605
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,733
They turned 10 over
to the Confederate Army

606
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:46,134
'cause they were deserters.

607
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:47,801
And the other four,

608
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:49,904
they actually brought back
to to where Mrs. Spivey lived.

609
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:51,939
They executed those men
right there on the property.

610
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,976
Okay.

611
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:01,515
Inside the house, I encountered a couple

612
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,985
of very solid, conscious dead people.

613
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,222
One was an older man.

614
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,924
He has severe OCD.

615
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:11,525
And I felt like the living

616
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,560
might have some of these experiences,

617
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,365
going through spells of OCD.

618
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,001
So you'll, like, work
a problem to death,

619
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,136
or you'll reflect on something to death.

620
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:24,405
And he likes messing with
people's ears and faces.

621
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,608
He likes to touch that.

622
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,510
You just hit that on cue.

623
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:29,910
The hair pulling,

624
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:33,048
the messing with my
face constantly at night.

625
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,885
And the OCD part, I have
seen that especially on her.

626
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,687
Yes. I can get on one thought,

627
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,756
and I can just wring it

628
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,525
and just take it as far as
it can go, and then some.

629
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,795
But does that happen to
you when you're not home?

630
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,865
No.

631
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:53,734
Do you have any idea who this
guy might've been in life?

632
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,803
He was in his late 60s.

633
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:59,107
He seemed short. He
died fairly recently.

634
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:02,843
He had compulsive
behaviors in life, you know.

635
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:05,480
He was fussy with other living people.

636
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,014
He was very neurotic.

637
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:09,015
He's not okay right now.

638
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,087
Well, that's the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

639
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,454
My father.

640
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,223
Really?

641
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:18,092
He was 62 when he died.

642
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:19,426
Okay.

643
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:22,329
He was a... just a hard-ass, period.

644
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:24,933
Strict, loving at the same time.

645
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:28,235
My mom, she had to walk around
the house with a white glove,

646
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:29,436
check for dust.

647
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:31,173
Wow, okay.

648
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:32,573
Compulsive.

649
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:38,081
So the thing is, he's drawn to you.

650
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,348
He's trying to always talk to you

651
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,819
to give you warnings.

652
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:49,724
He tells me, "I'm
trying to wake them up.

653
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:52,393
Wake up! Wake up!"

654
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,562
But you're just completely, like,

655
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,667
I guess kind of ignoring him?

656
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:04,038
He's trying to warn you.

657
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,408
He's trying to protect from
the other dead that are here.

658
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,977
You were hinting at him,

659
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:11,779
like you think he may
have some abilities.

660
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:14,115
You do have quite a few
dead people around you.

661
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:19,052
And it feels like they can
really talk to you, so...

662
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:23,957
Well, I got a couple of
photos of Deborah's father.

663
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,194
This is her wedding day.

664
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,695
Okay.

665
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,964
Is that who you think it was?

666
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,868
It looks like him, but way thinner.

667
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,002
Way thinner.

668
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:37,304
And when he passed, he was way thinner.

669
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:38,740
Okay, that makes sense.

670
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:40,207
When we spoke,

671
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,543
you said you thought your father
was there from time to time.

672
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,113
Yeah.

673
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:50,016
Here, take that.

674
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,587
Thank you.

675
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,797
Just miss him. I miss him a lot.

676
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:06,768
You mentioned you ran into
a couple of dead people.

677
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,069
Who else?

678
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,071
One of the people that
I'm most concerned about

679
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,406
is this young dead guy.

680
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,041
He is a threat.

681
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,677
It, to me, felt like

682
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,512
he didn't particularly care for women.

683
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:23,685
I think he's kind of a psycho.

684
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:25,352
My assumption was

685
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:29,291
that he wasn't a particularly
good person when he was alive.

686
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:32,963
At one point, he was like,
"Yeah, I want to kill things."

687
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:37,865
Well, it... it's a shot in the dark,

688
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,867
but remember the guy I
told you about, Mills Eure,

689
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:41,269
who got beat up by The Buffaloes?

690
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,537
Yes.

691
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,772
He had a son, Mills
Jr., who was a drunk.

692
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,641
And one time, he went on
a 10-day alcohol bender.

693
00:33:47,643 --> 00:33:49,010
Apparently, he wound up

694
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:51,345
walking through the
streets downtown nearby,

695
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:53,013
shooting his gun in the air.

696
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,483
And people were scurrying
all over the place.

697
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:57,685
He approaches this local merchant

698
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:59,553
by the name of Edward Gatlin.

699
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:01,289
And he says, "I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you."

700
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,656
And he goes for his gun.

701
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:04,158
Gatlin was a quicker shot,

702
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,093
pulled out his gun, and
shoots him in the back.

703
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:09,530
There's only other one weird
thing about the property.

704
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,064
And you mentioned women?

705
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:15,637
Mills had two wives who
died young on the property,

706
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,004
and there's no record
of what they died of.

707
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,774
Then I spoke with
a 96-year-old woman

708
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:24,412
whose grandfather
bought the land in 1882.

709
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:26,548
His name was Thomas Pitman.

710
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,350
He had lost two wives
as well on the property.

711
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,251
- Wow.
- And they were both young.

712
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,388
Interesting. Okay.

713
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,591
Now, this young dead guy you saw,

714
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:38,760
what could he do to affect the living?

715
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:41,062
Well, the thing was, a female showed up,

716
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,963
a dead female.

717
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:44,198
And this person

718
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,535
seemed to have been in
a relationship with him.

719
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:51,004
And he was very irritated
that she showed up.

720
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,008
And they were, like, arguing.

721
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,709
And he was, like, you
know, really pissed off.

722
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,077
What I saw was, like,

723
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,214
the living picking up on
their anger and fighting,

724
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:01,649
and so they're emulating them.

725
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:03,084
So they're fighting, as well.

726
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:07,588
And if he's around, you
could feel, like, ice.

727
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,923
Like, it was really, like...

728
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:11,158
can go right through you, you know?

729
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,894
You can tell when he's around

730
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:16,229
because it's like total
10-degree drop instantly.

731
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,932
With the arguing,

732
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:20,033
I've actually seen
that between my parents.

733
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,037
It's just so much
drama, so much argument,

734
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,543
so much, just, chaos.

735
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:29,910
We're not together.

736
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:31,245
We're not solid.

737
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:32,979
Okay.

738
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,914
Well, what concerned me

739
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,417
was the room with the pastel bedspread.

740
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:38,952
That's Nikki's room,

741
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:41,856
but she's so terrified in
there, she sleeps with her mom.

742
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:44,727
They're maybe feeling, like, movement.

743
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,129
Hearing, like, mumbling,

744
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:51,064
feeling pressure on the bed,

745
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,899
like, when they're laying on the bed.

746
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,671
He was grabbing my shoulder,

747
00:35:56,673 --> 00:36:00,307
and he was grabbing the back of my leg.

748
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:03,343
And because he can be so physical,

749
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,646
that's where it gets scary,

750
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:08,785
because he does really hate women.

751
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,053
Deborah and Nikki both feel

752
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,622
that whatever's in the
house is targeting women.

753
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:18,193
Everything that
you said about the bedroom,

754
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:20,560
I've experienced everything.

755
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:22,363
The voices, the mumbling.

756
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:24,231
I've felt the bed shake.

757
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:26,867
Once, I got pushed back,

758
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,937
and I felt like something
was on top of my chest.

759
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:30,972
Like, I couldn't breathe.

760
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:32,142
It felt like something was on my neck.

761
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,508
It also happened to Deborah.

762
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,042
She got attacked the same type of way.

763
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:36,443
I was sitting on the bed.

764
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,912
My hands are just in my lap.

765
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:39,280
And all of a sudden,

766
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,582
they flew back and
hit the headboard hard.

767
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:43,850
And my throat just literally went up,

768
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,120
and I'm being choked.

769
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,823
They've been, um...

770
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:51,225
touched inappropriately, both women.

771
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:53,127
I was kind of sleeping.

772
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,495
I was going in and out.

773
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:55,363
And all of a sudden,

774
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:57,298
I started feeling something touch me.

775
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,834
And it was going from my neck,
and I felt it go lower, lower,

776
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,570
then I was feeling it just caress me.

777
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:03,071
My gosh.

778
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:04,338
But she's not the only

779
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,906
one that's been touched that way.

780
00:37:05,908 --> 00:37:07,408
So has Deborah.

781
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,081
He's done that, but he
got a little further.

782
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:18,153
Why didn't you tell me about these?

783
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,388
How can I tell you

784
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,691
that I think I just almost
got raped by that dead guy?

785
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:33,536
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

786
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,077
Geez!

787
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,551
Can he really do this?

788
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:50,684
Deborah, he has.

789
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,091
Can he take her life?

790
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,477
I did do a sketch.

791
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,486
Geez!

792
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,499
Can he really do this?

793
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,633
Deborah, he has.

794
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,607
Can he take her life?

795
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,310
Yeah.

796
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:53,316
He is insane, and he
wants to kill people.

797
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,925
It would scratch me everywhere...

798
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:09,129
my chest, my back, my stomach, my legs.

799
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:12,901
You can actually see the
scratch marks going all over.

800
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:15,635
And I got photos of them.

801
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:17,807
Wow.

802
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:23,678
I've always felt he wanted her.

803
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,318
He can do anything,
but I can't stop him.

804
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:33,153
Well, guys, I know
tonight was a rough night,

805
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:34,423
but I don't think any of us

806
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,156
thought it was gonna be an easy one.

807
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,658
No.

808
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,028
Now we need to answer
your big question...

809
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,296
how to keep the women of the house safe.

810
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,332
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

811
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:49,504
What I would like to see happen
is for a medium to come out

812
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:55,075
and for you to receive a
reading with this medium

813
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,914
to talk to your father.

814
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:01,582
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

815
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:02,950
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

816
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:06,455
Okay. He'll have a lot
of good advice for you.

817
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:08,689
I think it'll be a
really good experience

818
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:10,559
for both of you guys.

819
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:14,095
And that should help him to move on.

820
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:18,966
Then, the next day, two
mediums need to come back,

821
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:22,104
a male medium and a female medium.

822
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:25,673
The female medium needs
to be really feminine.

823
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:29,077
The male medium needs
to be pretty tough.

824
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,113
Both of the mediums

825
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:35,249
will engage with the guy in your bedroom

826
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:39,955
and forcefully remove
him from the location.

827
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,089
And his dead girlfriend will go with him

828
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,624
because of their situation.

829
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:47,928
So let me ask you a question.
Why a feminine woman?

830
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,267
Because a feminine
woman would be, to him,

831
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:56,303
someone that he could
dominate and possess

832
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:58,405
because he views women as weak.

833
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:01,309
Well, this has got to be good news.

834
00:41:01,311 --> 00:41:03,144
You told me you thought it was
a frigging demon in the house.

835
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:04,479
Yeah, I'm glad it's not.

836
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:07,117
Well, it's the next thing to a demon.

837
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:13,687
I'm hoping that, once
all of this is out,

838
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:16,957
that the family can come
back to where it was.

839
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:20,294
Because it wasn't always a strain.

840
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:23,164
It wasn't always chaos.
It wasn't always hateful.

841
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,934
Are you gonna do what
Amy suggests you guys do?

842
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:28,870
Yeah.

843
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:30,174
Can't wait to start.

844
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,278
If the family follows my advice,

845
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,713
Deborah's dad will finally be free,

846
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:41,682
and the evil man tormenting
the women of the house

847
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:43,151
will be kicked out for good.

848
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:44,785
Then this family will find

849
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:46,356
the peace it's been searching for.
