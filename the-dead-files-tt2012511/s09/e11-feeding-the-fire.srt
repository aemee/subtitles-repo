1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,845
For the living and the dead,

2
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,881
this is just a terrible place.

3
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,951
Something is tearing
my family apart.

4
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,287
This person is scary.

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,024
I just know,
whatever it is, it's bad.

6
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,395
It's physically painful
to be in here.

7
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,464
Sickness is everywhere.

8
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,666
I just hear death.
<i> -Aah!</i>

9
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,902
My name is Amy Allan.

10
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,537
God.

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,039
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,140
I see dead people.

13
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,408
Her face was all demonic.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,143
I speak to dead people.

15
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,945
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,347
And they speak to me.

17
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,882
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

18
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,018
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

20
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,588
I rely on my partner.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,157
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,892
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

23
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,393
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,596
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,764
They're everywhere.

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,166
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,535
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

28
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,037
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,106
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,307
...until the very end...

31
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,975
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

32
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,844
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,946
That's it.

34
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,214
...or time to get out.

35
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,717
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

36
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,819
<i> Aaaaaah!</i>

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,770
I'm out here in Kaufman, Texas.

38
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,140
It's about 35 miles
southeast of Dallas.

39
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,575
I got a call
from a guy named Larry.

40
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,978
Now, this guy's got
a real problem on his hands.

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,646
He says paranormal activity
in the house

42
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,348
already broke up his marriage

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,152
and, now, his three daughters
are coming under attack.

44
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,386
He says we're his last hope

45
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,021
to bring his family
back together.

46
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,523
I really hope we can
help this poor guy out.

47
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,864
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,733
I clear the house
of any leading information.

49
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,635
Family photos
and religious items

50
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,504
must be covered or removed.

51
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,305
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

52
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,540
for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,791
That's weird.

54
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,562
Something's wrong here.

55
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,298
It feels,
really horrible

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,637
and it's just like this
sickness is just everywhere.

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,173
And then, there's like this
depression, this depression.

58
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,375
And it's scary.
Something going on.

59
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,809
And it's huge.
It's so bad.

60
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,077
And you just wanna run away.

61
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,714
And you want to run
the **** away.

62
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,629
All right. So, Larry,
when we spoke on the phone,

63
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,164
you sounded pretty upset.

64
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,166
What the hell's going on?

65
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,536
Something is tearing
my family apart.

66
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,905
Relationships
have gone to hell.

67
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,942
My wife finally got
to the point

68
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:34,413
where she just asked me
to move out.

69
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,381
She was my golden girl
and I figured that we'd

70
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,651
live the rest of our lives
together, 'til we died.

71
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,653
That's just not
the way it happened.

72
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,988
Why would you think
it's the paranormal

73
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,189
that broke up your marriage?

74
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,592
Something is wanting
to take control

75
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,193
of the women in the house

76
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:51,463
and trying to get rid
of all of the men.

77
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,732
All right. So this is
a pretty unusual arrangement

78
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,967
you guys got going here.

79
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,301
Now, who's living where?

80
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,303
I'm living in this
house over here

81
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,138
and my wife
and my three daughters

82
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,940
are living in this
house over here.

83
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,141
Okay.
- Matter of fact,

84
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,977
I've got a picture
of my family

85
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,979
that's staying
at that house.

86
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,914
Okay. So who's this?
- This is Chelsea.

87
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,250
Next to her is Denise,
my wife.

88
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,518
Okay.
- Next to her is Brittany,

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,287
my oldest daughter.

90
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,623
And that's Ashley,
my middle daughter.

91
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,057
All right.
So, Larry, do me favor.

92
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,459
Give me a list
of what's going on here.

93
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,361
We hear voices.

94
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,663
We see shadows.

95
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,000
We're having physical
attacks on the girls,

96
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,236
that's causing
health issues.

97
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,639
I've got
rheumatoid arthritis.

98
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,308
I've got degenerative
bone disease,

99
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,343
suffering
from depression.

100
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,845
I had a heart attack.

101
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,748
My wife had
thyroid cancer.

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,183
So, Larry, I gotta ask ya:
how old are ya?

103
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,952
Sixty.
- I mean, the ailments

104
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,954
you're talking about are
for a much older man

105
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,289
and I can't help
but notice the walker.

106
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,257
What's with the walker?

107
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,226
Well, me and my
daughter Ashley

108
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,228
got into an altercation.

109
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,696
She downright kicked me,

110
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,431
broke the crap
outta my leg

111
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,701
in three
different places.

112
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,704
It was like
something took over.

113
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,707
What do you
want out of this investigation?

114
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,176
I want whatever
is here is gone,

115
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,578
so that me and my wife
and my family

116
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,213
can all be a family
again.

117
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:25,857
There's somebody here
who's having really,

118
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,893
really bad knee issues.

119
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,872
I see like a woman.

120
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,075
And she's like screaming.

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,819
And I'm seeing her like
running after a man.

122
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,455
She's beating him.
Very abusive.

123
00:05:56,457 --> 00:06:00,759
It's very abusive.
Very bad, very bad.

124
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,294
He's running away from her.

125
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:05,397
She's screaming
at the top of her lungs.

126
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,368
I'm getting like chills
down my back.

127
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,936
It's so **** negative.

128
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,245
Okay. So what kind
of experiences are you having?

129
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,346
I got attacked.

130
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,851
I got slapped real hard,
twice, on the arm

131
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,487
and it made me bolt
out of bed.

132
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,789
It freaked me out.

133
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,524
I went
into the bathroom

134
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,926
and I lifted up
my nightshirt

135
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,397
and there was three
scratches on my belly

136
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,767
and my lower rib cage
on my right side.

137
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,035
Now, I know there's dogs
all over the place.

138
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,604
You sure the dog
didn't do this?

139
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,305
The marks were
so far apart.

140
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,141
It was bigger
than my dog's paw.

141
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,344
There's no way that my dogs
coulda made those marks.

142
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,780
All right.
So, anything else?

143
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,016
We see shadow figures
and they've gotta be,

144
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,853
I would say,
every bit of 10, 11 feet.

145
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,988
They're everywhere.

146
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,157
I feel somebody's
in the room with me

147
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,059
and I know that
there's no one there.

148
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,327
I need answers.

149
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,464
Something's just
tearing us apart.

150
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,965
Okay.

151
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,504
I see an old, old man.

152
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,507
And he's creeping about.

153
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,576
Living people with him
would feel watched.

154
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:30,348
Maybe they might see a shadow
like that on the wall.

155
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,950
He is a creepy mother****.

156
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:40,125
I think there's like a<i> lot</i>
of stuff going on here.

157
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,733
So, Denise,
I was talking to Larry.

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,202
He was pretty convinced

159
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,137
that the paranormal
broke you and him up.

160
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,073
You agree with that?
- No. I don't.

161
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,608
People's relationships
don't work out

162
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,610
all the time
and people walk away.

163
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,579
And I assume you don't believe
in the paranormal.

164
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,948
No. I do believe
in paranormal.

165
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,417
It's terrorizing my --
my family.

166
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,818
Have you had
any experiences?

167
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,154
Yes. We've had
a family photo

168
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,090
that fell on the floor.
- Where was it?

169
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,994
It's in the entryway,
on a like a mantelpiece

170
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,629
and it was sitting
up there

171
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,631
and it just fell off.

172
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,132
Got a bunch
of dogs here, right?

173
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,335
- Yeah.
- Sure one of the dogs didn't?

174
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,670
No. They had been
asleep on the couch.

175
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,539
Okay.
Well, talking to Larry,

176
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,475
he thinks the paranormal
is causing health problems here.

177
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,711
You agree with that?
- I do believe that.

178
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,679
Now, I, you know, I hate
to say this, but, I mean,

179
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,548
Larry's 60, right?
- Yes.

180
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,517
He doesn't look good
for his age.

181
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,318
No. He looks more
like 80.

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,720
If he keeps going
the way he's going,

183
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:45,056
he's going to end up dying
a very premature death.

184
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,426
I don't want his children
to have to go through,

185
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,028
you know,
what I've gone through.

186
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,630
What do you mean by that?

187
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,532
I had a stepfather
who raised me

188
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,569
and he died
25 years ago, so.

189
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,005
He was murdered.

190
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,807
It was very rough
'cause we were very close.

191
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,442
I would never
want my children

192
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,479
to have to go through that
'cause it was bad.

193
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,958
Horrible, horrible,
negative energy.

194
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,464
It feels like I'm walking
through sludge, like

195
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,899
Somebody lost someone.

196
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,335
Someone can't breathe.

197
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,772
Can't breathe because
they lost this person.

198
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:38,376
Whoever's here isn't
getting over that, at all.

199
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,312
He didn't die here.

200
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,381
He died far away, recent,

201
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,184
anywhere from 1990
to now, maybe.

202
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,619
This guy's a good guy.

203
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,622
He's trying to get away
from here, but he can't.

204
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,557
There's like
an energetic cord

205
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,293
that's formed
between this dead man

206
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,531
and a living person
he had a relationship with.

207
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,633
All I saw was them
pulling this cord

208
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:06,237
and he's like "Aaaaah!
No! No!"

209
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,639
Not a happy situation.

210
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,260
So, Chelsea, I understand
you're the youngest

211
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,795
of the three girls, correct?
- Yes.

212
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,130
- Okay. How old are you?
- I'm 20.

213
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,834
- Have you had any experiences?
- Yes. I had a experience

214
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,169
where I was sleeping
in my bed

215
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,705
and I heard something
like whisper, "Hey."

216
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,074
And I could feel the hair
move next to my ear

217
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,143
and I like woke up
out of a dead sleep,

218
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,879
like with shivers
down my spine.

219
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,081
You sure you weren't dreaming?
- Yes.

220
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,816
Okay. Anything else?

221
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,853
Lately, I've been getting
phantom bruising on my leg.

222
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,121
Where on the leg
would it hit you?

223
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,024
It's like the inner thigh
or sometimes, it'll be

224
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,192
on the back of my arms.

225
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,394
I actually have
a picture.

226
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,566
Jeez. No dogs
in that room with you?

227
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,801
No.

228
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,036
All right.
Anything else?

229
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,406
I've had dreams of a family
getting murdered.

230
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:15,807
Really?
- Yes.

231
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,010
And then, I also
had dreams of my sister

232
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,913
committing suicide
in our bathroom.

233
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,282
Which sister?
- Brittany.

234
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,384
She hung herself
from the shower stall.

235
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,187
She told me it was something
I had to let her do,

236
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,223
so I just watched her
do it, in my dream.

237
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,392
I mean, is that something
you worry about?

238
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,728
She's never been that way,
so, for me to just

239
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,496
have that dream
was really off the wall.

240
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,098
All right, so,
with dreams like that,

241
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,733
it's gotta be tough,
sleeping in your bedroom.

242
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,501
I actually don't sleep
in here anymore.

243
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,303
I sleep with my mom.

244
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,672
Why?
- It's so embarrassing, but,

245
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,341
I- I don't feel safe
to sleep in my room.

246
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm seeing a dead woman in here.

247
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,283
I think she was murdered.

248
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,851
She comes
right through the wall.

249
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,454
She's trying to reach
whoever's in this bed.

250
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,591
I know she tries to talk

251
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,626
'cause she saying,
"Help me. Help me."

252
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:12,797
She's trying to get them
through dreams.

253
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,936
Feel like she,
can get physical?

254
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:22,307
I'm hearing smacking,
enough to wake them up.

255
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,076
I don't like it.

256
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,578
I don't like it.

257
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,220
Seems like everybody in
the house is having experiences.

258
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,721
Now, what about yourself?

259
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,558
I've seen a massive
shadow in here.

260
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,926
Okay.
Can you describe it to me?

261
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,096
It was huge. It almost
touched the ceiling,

262
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,998
basically took up
the whole wall.

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
How are you sleeping
at night?

264
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,769
I do suffer
from anxiety.

265
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,104
So, my mind races
at night.

266
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,672
I think of everything
and nothing,

267
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,442
all at the same time.

268
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,544
What do you think is here?

269
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:04,048
I think whatever is here
just messes with us

270
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,216
in different ways,

271
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,986
brings out the worst
in people.

272
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,387
We were once so happy

273
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,457
and our family's
being torn apart.

274
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,692
Okay. It upsets you?

275
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,628
Yes.

276
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,629
You okay?

277
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:26,971
For the living and the dead,
this is just a terrible place.

278
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,441
I don't know how
they can be in here.

279
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,944
Like it's physically painful
to be in here.

280
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,680
And it's all depression,

281
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,884
depression, horrible,
horrible depression.

282
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,854
This room is completely
filled with it,

283
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,089
like just this black goop.

284
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,327
This black goop is literally
coming out of the walls.

285
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,965
- So what is this?
- It seems to be a collection

286
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:58,536
of negative thoughts,
feelings, and emotions

287
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:04,809
that are pushed out
of a living person.

288
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:12,584
This kind of negativity
can cause like

289
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:17,355
mentally illnesses,
physical illnesses.

290
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:21,059
It could cause them to do
and act irrationally.

291
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,329
It's really bad.

292
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,771
So, Ashley, you're the girl
that broke your dad's leg.

293
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,807
That right?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,342
Now, you know
he doesn't blame you.

295
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,211
He blames the paranormal.

296
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,379
Yeah.

297
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,214
Do you agree with that?

298
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,484
He was acting pretty
weird that day, so.

299
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,221
Okay. Your family,
you think they're in danger?

300
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,357
Yeah. I believe
wholeheartedly

301
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,993
that they're in danger.

302
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,561
You've had experiences,
I'm assuming.

303
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,229
Yes. I've had many.

304
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,964
Why don't you tell me
about some of 'em?

305
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,634
The night
that my boyfriend

306
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,402
had proposed to me,

307
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,105
when I came home
that night,

308
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,873
I was going to bed
- Okay.

309
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,544
and, when I got up,
about 3:00 am,

310
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,347
my pants were off

311
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,484
and they were placed
by my pillow.

312
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,352
So, was your boyfriend
here with you?

313
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,187
- No.
- So you were in bed alone?

314
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,594
Okay. You okay?

315
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,598
Yeah. I'll be okay.

316
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,367
I'm sorry, sweetie.

317
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,304
I couldn't even imagine
waking up and seeing that.

318
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:44,575
There were bruises
on my thighs, too.

319
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,945
I showed my mom.

320
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,947
They really
freaked her out.

321
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,448
Yeah.

322
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,450
And then,
you know, then,

323
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,986
that's when the blowup
with my dad happened.

324
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,125
What do you think's
going on in this house?

325
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,094
I don't know, honestly.

326
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,396
I just know, whatever
it is, it's bad.

327
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,579
Kaufman<i> is</i> small-town America.

328
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,648
This place is like Mayberry.

329
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,016
So, when I asked a genealogist

330
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,085
to look into
the property for me,

331
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,253
she said she already
knew all about it

332
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,788
and that one of the
original families

333
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,390
had a riches-to-rags story

334
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,158
I'm definitely gonna
wanna hear about.

335
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,632
So, Rebecca, before we get
to this riches-to-rags story,

336
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,168
who were the original owners
and when did they

337
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,104
actually purchase the land
I'm investigating?

338
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,805
The original owner
of this property

339
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,574
was Thomas Shannon.

340
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:53,911
He purchased over
1,100 acres in 1882.

341
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,179
So what did he do with it?

342
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,015
He farmed this property.

343
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,017
So, even though they didn't
have the easiest time,

344
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,319
they were able to have
a prosperous farm

345
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,987
in this place.
- Okay. So what do you mean by,

346
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,222
"They didn't have
the easiest time"?

347
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,759
Three of Thomas Shannon's
children, and his wife, died

348
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,694
in a very short
period of time.

349
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,029
While they were
on that property?

350
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,231
Correct.
Thomas Shannon, himself,

351
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,799
actually died on the
property as well,

352
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,501
in 1906.

353
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,935
Okay.
What'd he die of?

354
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,470
Well, we can see
in his death certificate

355
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,740
right here, basically,
he died of exhaustion.

356
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,108
Exhaustion?

357
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,844
So how old was he
at the time of his death?

358
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,946
- He was 66.
- All right.

359
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,716
So, now, Thomas Shannon is dead.
Who gets the property?

360
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,751
Well, it changes hands
a couple times

361
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,687
and it ends up with
his grandson Shannon Jones.

362
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,489
All right. So now, the grandson
has the property.

363
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,024
What's he wind up
doing with it?

364
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,727
Well, he's not able to
hold on to the property.

365
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,362
Unfortunately,
he doesn't seem to have

366
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,931
the capitalist gift
of his grandfather

367
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,333
and, from this date
in 1922,

368
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,471
we see him selling
the property off.

369
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,907
All right. So what winds up
happening with Jones?

370
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,176
Shannon Jones dies
of a heart attack,

371
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,278
actually, in 1948.

372
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,147
So he's 55,
which is young.

373
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,650
And the doctor mentions
it's from overwork.

374
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,984
Yeah. I see that on there.

375
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,286
Basically,
he worked himself to death.

376
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,823
Yes.

377
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:17,829
I see an angry man
in his 30s or 40s.

378
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,399
I would think it was
between 1930 and 1950s?

379
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:26,037
And he was out and there was
nothing, nothing, nothing,

380
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,307
except for<i> dirt,</i>
a lot of<i> dirt,</i>

381
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,845
and he's freaking
the **** out.

382
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,782
He started screaming and yelling
that he can't do it anymore.

383
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,983
He had money.

384
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,551
I just see the bank.

385
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:45,289
But then, I see all these papers
and someone -- on a desk --

386
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,791
and someone's taking a stamp

387
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,560
and stamping the word "Bank"
on these papers.

388
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,064
So it's one after the other,
Bank, Bank, Bank.

389
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,466
Then, he thinks, "I'm gonna
**** shoot myself."

390
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,072
So far, I've got a house
full of women who say

391
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,441
they're getting physically
attacked on a property

392
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,377
that's seen
at least five deaths.

393
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,913
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

394
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,682
Searching through old records,
I find Charlie Ice,

395
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,885
one of the property's
previous owners.

396
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,687
Turns out Charlie had
some dirty laundry.

397
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,957
Weeks after his wife died,
he married her young caretaker.

398
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,861
I'm on my way to meet a local

399
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,597
who knew everyone involved
in this scandal and she says

400
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,368
the nurse was volatile,
unstable, and violent.

401
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,807
I understand that you grew up
in this town

402
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,343
and you knew Charlie Ice,
or knew of him.

403
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:44,048
Yes. This is a photo
of Charlie.

404
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,584
This is his first wife,
Opal.

405
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,321
So, when does Charlie Ice

406
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,356
wind up getting
my client's property?

407
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,991
1953.

408
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,459
So, take me through
this scandal.

409
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,461
What happened?

410
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,131
This is Mary and,
evidently, he had been

411
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,768
having an affair with her
for quite a while.

412
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,837
It seems as though
he had a love child.

413
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,540
A love child?
How do we know that?

414
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,877
Because his name is
on that birth certificate.

415
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,012
Okay. Yeah.
He's the father on here.

416
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,647
How old was Charlie,
at the time?

417
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,116
Charlie is 44.

418
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,052
Mary is 20.

419
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,755
When Opal gets sick
in 1968,

420
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:29,727
he employs Mary
to take care of Opal.

421
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,663
She and the child
move in.

422
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,832
You're kidding me.

423
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,133
All right,
so I know Opal dies.

424
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,636
When and what
did she die of?

425
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,039
She dies in 1968,
at the age of 58,

426
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,410
from a blood clot
in the lung.

427
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,112
Three weeks later,

428
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,350
Charlie marries
Mary Louise Winkler.

429
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,386
Okay.
How's that go for them?

430
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:59,390
Well, evidently,
not as<i> he</i> had planned.

431
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,860
She had a temper,
she had outbursts,

432
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,630
and sometimes,
she was violent.

433
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,398
All right. So, how long
are these two married?

434
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,933
Seven years.

435
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,636
He died suddenly
of a heart attack.

436
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,571
All right. So do we know
if Mary's still alive?

437
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:19,010
She died in 2013,
of Alzheimer's.

438
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,481
I'm getting a female.

439
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,417
And I'm hearing "mother,"
mother and grandmother.

440
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,818
I'm wondering like
if this is somebody

441
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,290
who just lived here
and recently died here.

442
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:38,129
I wanna say like maybe late 30s
to like, you know, 50.

443
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,364
This person is scary.

444
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,903
They're<i> extremely</i> abusive.

445
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,705
There's a physical
illness, though,

446
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,208
that is involving
their head, that's bad.

447
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,059
One other thing
caught my eye in research:

448
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,128
a young schoolteacher
who was brutally murdered

449
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,362
on the side of the road

450
00:22:22,364 --> 00:22:24,431
right near Larry
and Denise's property.

451
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,566
Now, I don't know if this
is gonna help my case,

452
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,669
but I'm meeting with
the Kaufman County Sheriff

453
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:29,870
to see exactly what happened.

454
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,880
So, Sheriff, before we get
to the actual homicide,

455
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,648
what do we know
about the victim?

456
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,550
Her name was
Linda Jane Phillips

457
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:46,653
and I have
a picture of her.

458
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:49,256
She was 26 years of age.

459
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:50,323
She graduated from

460
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:54,261
North Texas State
University in 1966

461
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:57,230
and subsequently became
a schoolteacher in Dallas.

462
00:22:57,232 --> 00:22:59,533
Okay.
- She was teaching in Dallas

463
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:01,668
and living in Dallas,
but still, apparently,

464
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,171
had a very close relationship
with her family

465
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,673
and would still spend
the summers here.

466
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:14,448
I'm seeing
the murdered woman again.

467
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:20,387
And I got the name either
Linda or Lily with her,

468
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:23,056
something with an L --
Leelee?

469
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:26,693
She was between 25
and 35 years old, very small.

470
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,729
She was superthin

471
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:34,701
and she's<i> all</i> kinds of
scared and pissed.

472
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:35,902
So, take me through
the night of the murder.

473
00:23:35,904 --> 00:23:37,003
What happened?

474
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:38,739
August 8th of 1970,

475
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:42,542
she attended a wedding
party in Dallas

476
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,511
and subsequently
called her parents

477
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:47,047
at about 10:30
and told them

478
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,248
she would not be
coming home.

479
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,450
She was gonna stay
with a girlfriend.

480
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:53,120
She never arrived there.

481
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:55,288
The car was found

482
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,524
during the search
on the 9th of August.

483
00:23:57,526 --> 00:23:58,592
Okay.

484
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:00,127
And then,

485
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:02,529
approximately
20 hours later,

486
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:03,864
her body was found,

487
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,599
approximately
3 miles from there.

488
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:12,339
26 stab wounds.

489
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:14,107
"Lacerations of Neck
& Abdomen."

490
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,612
Jeez.

491
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:22,749
Subsequent investigation
and autopsy revealed

492
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:24,718
that she'd been
sexually assaulted.

493
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,319
Anybody arrested for this?

494
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:29,156
14 years later, in 1984,

495
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:32,058
the self-confessed
mass murderer

496
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,294
named Henry Lee Lucas
confessed to it.

497
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:36,196
I know Henry Lee Lucas.

498
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:37,697
He confessed to a lot
of murders, this guy.

499
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:38,899
He did.

500
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,200
What was your impression?

501
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:41,701
He was a liar.

502
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:44,004
What's your opinion on it?
Do you think Henry Lee did it?

503
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,772
I don't believe he did.

504
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,774
Okay.
- There's no evidence

505
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,176
that he did it,
other than his word,

506
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:53,046
and obviously, his word
is not not good.

507
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:54,948
So the killer
could still be out there.

508
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,183
Yes.

509
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,450
Okay.

510
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,793
She's so wrapped up
in how she **** died.

511
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:09,529
It was somewhere in Texas.

512
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,032
And she was wearing
a really pretty dress.

513
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:15,468
Boyfriend comes in
and then, these two big like

514
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,306
strong-arm dudes come in
and they took her.

515
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:21,007
They throw her in this old car.
<i> -Aaaagh!</i>

516
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,910
One's in the back
and he's **** beating
the **** out of her.

517
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:27,948
There's also

518
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,417
sexual stuff happening.

519
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,154
And she sees her arm
being cut off.

520
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:35,222
With what?

521
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:37,858
I think it was like
a **** knife.

522
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,927
I know they did
something here, too.

523
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,398
You know? So this is all
**** up, like cut open.

524
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,500
And then, she passed out
and then,

525
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:50,270
they did something to her

526
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:52,839
neck or head, or something.

527
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:55,442
Then, they scattered her body
parts along the road.

528
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:06,386
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

529
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:09,389
but the bedroom filled
with big, black, negative goop

530
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:12,058
has me the most concerned.

531
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,994
There's this little hallway.

532
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:16,129
The bedroom door is open.

533
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:21,468
The room was filled with black,
gelatinous stuff.

534
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,304
It's like spilling
into the hallway.

535
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:30,110
Amy,

536
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:32,379
is this what you saw?

537
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,914
Yes. That's what I saw.

538
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:57,037
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

539
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,139
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

540
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:02,208
and our clients,
for the first time.

541
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,811
So, Amy, this case
is a bit unusual.

542
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,781
This is Larry.
He lives next house over.

543
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:10,951
This is his estranged
wife, Denise.

544
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:14,654
She lives here with Brittany;

545
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:19,092
Ashley; and Chelsea,
her youngest daughter.

546
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,194
Now, Larry thinks
the paranormal activity

547
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:25,098
ripped his family apart and got
him kicked out of the house.

548
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,467
The ladies aren't buying that.

549
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,269
But everyone agrees
the activity

550
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:33,206
is getting worse and more
violent and it's gotta stop.

551
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,474
So, now that Amy knows
a little bit

552
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,409
about your family
and what's going on,

553
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,479
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

554
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:44,884
Initially, when I got here,
I encountered a female

555
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:48,888
and her situation is
that she was murdered.

556
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,960
She is pretty consumed
with the way that she died.

557
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:58,198
I connected with her
in the bedroom on the right.

558
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,733
All right,
so that's Chelsea's room.

559
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,934
That's the youngest
daughter.

560
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:02,202
Okay.

561
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:05,772
And I got her specifically
trying to make contact

562
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:08,375
with the individual
in that room.

563
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:11,411
One of the ways she's
trying to make contact is

564
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,346
through the living
person's dreams.

565
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:18,952
The other thing is she tries
to get physical.

566
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,855
One of the things she was
showing me doing was

567
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:25,759
smacking the person on the bed,
trying to wake them up.

568
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:29,496
She also tries
to talk to the person

569
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:32,432
and is constantly
whispering and yelling,

570
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:35,135
"Help me. Help me. Help me."

571
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,203
Chelsea's
so scared to death

572
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,105
of being in that room alone

573
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:41,775
that she sleeps with me
every night.

574
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:45,145
She's also heard someone say --
I can't remember if it was --

575
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:47,747
- "Hey." "Hey."
- "Hey"? Or "Hello" or something.

576
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,016
Now, she can get physical,
you were saying, right?

577
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,317
Yes.

578
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,320
So I have a picture here
of Chelsea's leg

579
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:57,724
and the bruises
she wakes up with.

580
00:28:57,726 --> 00:29:01,494
Yeah. She'll go to sleep
and there's nothing there.

581
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:05,331
and then, she wakes up and
there's bruises all over her.

582
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,101
Denise, tell Amy about
the nightmare she has.

583
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,537
She's been having
a recurring dream

584
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:12,539
of a murder of a family

585
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,543
and she sees this murder
over and over and over.

586
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,611
Interesting. Okay.

587
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:23,316
If people are coming
to her for help,

588
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,752
then she's most likely
a physical medium.

589
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,356
She probably has a<i> lot</i>
more people that show up,

590
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,525
that she's not aware of.

591
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:33,726
My god.

592
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:35,495
So this murdered girl
who comes to Chelsea,

593
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,430
did you get anything
on her in life?

594
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:41,034
She looked young,
between 25 and 35.

595
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:43,603
I got that her name
was Linda or Lily.

596
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,072
I saw her getting into a fight
with her boyfriend.

597
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:50,643
Then, two men grabbed her,
threw her in a car,

598
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,479
and they beat her

599
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,281
and they also
sexually assaulted her.

600
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:56,483
They had a knife.

601
00:29:56,485 --> 00:30:00,320
They cut open her stomach,
slit her throat.

602
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:01,955
And then, they took her body

603
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:05,191
and they scattered it
all over the place.

604
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:07,727
This is a tiny town.
There's not that many murders.

605
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,130
They have one murder
that sounds similar.

606
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:12,165
Almost 50 years ago,
a young woman was murdered

607
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:14,167
only a couple miles from here.

608
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,102
You said her name
was Linda or Lily?

609
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:18,037
Well, the victim in this case,

610
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,706
her name was
Linda Jane Phillips

611
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,508
and she was 26 years old.

612
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,710
Her parents live
right down the road from here.

613
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:26,146
So, on August 8, 1970,

614
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:28,581
Linda went to a wedding
party in Dallas.

615
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,283
10:30 that night,
she called her parents,

616
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:32,719
said she was gonna spend
the night at a friend's house.

617
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:34,787
Linda never made it.

618
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,523
A day later,
they found her body,

619
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:38,725
totally stripped naked.

620
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:42,629
She had been sexually assaulted
and stabbed 26 times.

621
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:44,531
Now, I got
her death certificate.

622
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:47,800
You talked about the stomach?

623
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:52,205
She was stabbed
in the neck and abdomen.

624
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:55,375
The sheriff I talked to
gave me Linda's picture.

625
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:58,745
Now, do you think that's
who you might have seen?

626
00:30:58,747 --> 00:30:59,846
Yes.

627
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:09,155
The other thing I saw
was an elderly male.

628
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:11,391
He's active in both houses.

629
00:31:11,393 --> 00:31:15,195
I called him the lurker
because he's always behind you.

630
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,730
Like you're always feeling
someone's right there

631
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,632
and they're watching you.

632
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:23,036
He doesn't particularly
care to be seen,

633
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,606
but if he is,
it's more like a black shadow.

634
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:30,677
The most concerning things
is that he seemed to be attached

635
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,881
to someone
in the master bedroom

636
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:37,584
and it's almost like
he's obsessed.

637
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:40,286
And I saw him like sitting
on the side of the bed

638
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,092
and like just really lightly
caressing the person's face.

639
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:49,862
Chelsea has seen that.

640
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,965
She has woke up
and she has told me.

641
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,199
One night, she said,

642
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:56,736
"Mom, I saw someone
at the end of our bed"

643
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:58,905
and she said,
"I pretended to be asleep

644
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:02,308
because I did not want
to move."

645
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,844
Larry, you've seen
shadow figures as well.

646
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:07,046
The shadow figures
that I've seen is

647
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:09,949
more dark than translucent,

648
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,218
where you couldn't
hardly see through it.

649
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,454
Now, you said this guy

650
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:16,956
likes to touch
inappropriately?

651
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:20,260
Brittany, I want you to tell the
story about your sister Ashley.

652
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:23,563
Yeah. She was
asleep in her bed.

653
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:26,366
She had long
pajama pants on

654
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,501
and she woke up

655
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,103
and they were off of her

656
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:32,538
and she has no clue
how they came off of her.

657
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,807
Okay.
- When I spoke to her,

658
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:36,309
she broke down,
talking about it.

659
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,177
Now, is that this guy,
doing all this?

660
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,780
Yeah.
He would be the one.

661
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:43,449
He's being a little bit more
inappropriate than I thought.

662
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:50,123
Anything else?

663
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,393
I encountered
another deceased male.

664
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:55,895
I got that he did die
far away.

665
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:59,632
I got that he died
between 1990 and now.

666
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:01,668
I got that there was
a deep family connection

667
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,504
to a living person
in this house

668
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:06,472
and it felt like there was
kind of a cord,

669
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:09,475
an energetic cord,
that was wrapped around him.

670
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:12,979
So he's being dragged
back in unwillingly.

671
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,480
This means that
a living person here

672
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,549
is inadvertently trapping him

673
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,320
and they can't really let go
of him emotionally.

674
00:33:20,322 --> 00:33:21,988
So we're talking about
a dead man with a connection

675
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,291
to a living person here,
died around 1990?

676
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:27,327
Yes.
- I hate to even bring this up,

677
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:30,096
but --
- My stepdad was murdered.

678
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:31,998
I mean, have you gotten

679
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,666
over it?

680
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,735
I've moved on, but,

681
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,104
they've never caught
his murderer, so,

682
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:40,606
it's been kinda hard.

683
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:03,029
I was afraid
this was gonna come up.

684
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,965
I think it's a really
difficult situation to be in

685
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:12,405
because you have an open murder
and you want justice for them

686
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:15,875
and that's something that,
unfortunately,

687
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:20,713
can sometimes keep them
kind of earthbound.

688
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,682
So how do I let him go?

689
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,417
Because I wouldn't
wish that for him.

690
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:31,858
So the thing I'm most concerned
about was the bedroom

691
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,460
at the end of the hall.
It was really bad.

692
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:36,462
I was only in there
for a few minutes.

693
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:37,830
One of
the interesting things

694
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:40,900
was that the dead
even refused to go in there.

695
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:43,403
That's Brittany's room.

696
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,572
It was physically painful.

697
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:49,208
Like pain in my ears,

698
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,345
head, headaches,
stomach, nausea.

699
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,880
She's always
had stomach problems.

700
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:56,416
I've always had nausea.

701
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:01,988
I also got depression in there,
a<i> lot</i> of sadness.

702
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,724
And the other thing I got
is that, when you're in there,

703
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:07,026
your brain is like
fully activated.

704
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:09,729
Like it's going 100 miles
a **** hour.

705
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:12,999
And, honestly, like
I couldn't even think straight.

706
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:16,302
I go through that
every single night.

707
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,171
I think about
everything and nothing

708
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:19,906
at the same time.

709
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,708
All this negative energy
has collected on the walls

710
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,346
of your room and formed
into this black goop.

711
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:30,783
And then, I saw it kind of
spilling out of that room

712
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:33,586
and going through the house.

713
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:38,157
This negative energy is coming
from a psychic empath.

714
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,893
So you're the psychic empath.

715
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:47,500
Everything that you feel, like
your emotions and stuff, you...

716
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:50,603
are having a hard time
keeping within you.

717
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:55,775
It's something that spills out
from you energetically.

718
00:35:55,777 --> 00:36:01,581
It can create negative thoughts
and negative thought patterns

719
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,585
and it can cause
irrational behavior.

720
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,187
Well, talking about
irrational behavior,

721
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:12,959
I mean, he did get his leg
broke by your daughter

722
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,160
Ashley.

723
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:17,396
He did. Yes.

724
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:20,166
He was talking to her
and she didn't wanna hear

725
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,468
what he had to say
about her fiancé.

726
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,370
- Okay.
- So she got up to leave

727
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:27,773
and he pushed her down
and she fought back

728
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,809
- Okay.
- and she broke his leg.

729
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:31,210
Wow.

730
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:33,646
It's like something
in this house

731
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:37,216
is trying to drive
all the men

732
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:38,784
out of the house,
so that they

733
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,753
can have their way
with the women.

734
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:44,023
And, you know,
me and Denise,

735
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:48,194
something came between us
and drew us apart.

736
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:50,162
Have you guys gone
for counseling?

737
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,397
- We did, for --
- Yes, we did.

738
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,598
- You did?
- We did, three times, and --

739
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,201
Three times?
Just three sessions?

740
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:56,469
- Just three sessions.
- Yes, three sessions.

741
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,771
What really made me quit

742
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:01,974
doing counseling was because
Larry had told me that,

743
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:04,243
regardless of what
I was gonna do, basically,

744
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:06,712
he was gonna keep on drinking
and I just knew.

745
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:13,252
I was like "I'm done."
26 years, down the tubes.

746
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:17,590
You are killing yourself,
plain and simple.

747
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,125
Your drinking
broke up the marriage

748
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:23,062
because she loves you
and she doesn't want you to die!

749
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:24,397
So, you need
to get help for that,

750
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,165
if you want your family back.

751
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:32,638
I mean, you worry about him.
Don't you?

752
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,706
Every day.

753
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,446
Man the **** up
and knock it **** off.

754
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:42,582
It's that simple.

755
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:46,218
The key is stop drinking,
take care of yourself,

756
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,487
because these people love you

757
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,324
and they don't want you
to be dead.

758
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:53,926
Is this black goop making
Larry's condition worse?

759
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:56,262
Yes.

760
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:59,599
Now, this gelatin thing
you described,

761
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:02,969
does it look that way
to you, or to everybody?

762
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,437
I had a sketch done of it.

763
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,886
My god.

764
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:23,656
You don't see it that way,
but you feel that way?

765
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:30,630
What exactly
is this thing?

766
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:32,131
It's emotions.

767
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,466
Her emotions?

768
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:36,035
Well, she collects emotions.
- So she's absorbing

769
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:39,238
everybody else's ****,
all their energy,

770
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,806
and it's led to this stuff
spilling out

771
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:42,074
all over the house?

772
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,709
Yes.

773
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:47,413
Aw, honey. It's okay.

774
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:09,235
So, Larry, you called us in
because you thought

775
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,803
the paranormal
broke up your marriage.

776
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,204
Well,
that's not the case.

777
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:14,340
But, turns out, it's a good
thing you did call us

778
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:17,176
'cause your kids are
under attack.

779
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:18,711
Now, to find out
what you can do about it,

780
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:21,047
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

781
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:25,084
There's family issues and then,
there's paranormal issues,

782
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:28,854
which do go hand-in-hand,
oftentimes.

783
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:31,123
There are dead that are attached
to this location,

784
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,125
for one reason or another

785
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:36,829
and for them, let's go ahead
and move them on.

786
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:39,398
What I would like to see
happen is a medium come out

787
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,133
to move on the dead

788
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:44,570
that are attached
to this specific location.

789
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:46,272
What about
Denise's stepdad?

790
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,608
What I would like to see is
you have a medium reading

791
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,711
just for him.
- Okay.

792
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:55,314
The second thing is
for Brittany.

793
00:39:55,316 --> 00:39:58,217
To prevent any more
of that stuff from forming

794
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:01,287
around you or in your
physical environment,

795
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,423
start journaling
every single night.

796
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,692
Well, the other thing is

797
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,462
for you to put these
in your bath.

798
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:12,732
It's a mixture of herbs
and crystals

799
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:17,737
and this is going to cleanse
away negative emotions,

800
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,006
the stuff that's accumulated.

801
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:24,844
So, for Chelsea,
at least one time a week,

802
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:28,748
she<i> has</i> to let the dead
come through, has to.

803
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,851
It's not fun, but, the dead
need to have access to her.

804
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:34,720
She's a medium and so,
she's gonna learn

805
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,922
setting appropriate
boundaries with them.

806
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:40,359
But if she doesn't do the once-
a- week thing with the dead,

807
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:46,232
they'll slam her,
and they'll slam her<i> hard.</i>

808
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,801
The last thing
that I wanted to say:

809
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:51,270
I would like the entire family

810
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:53,906
to go for family counseling.

811
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:56,075
Ev-er-y-one.

812
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:59,678
This is<i> extremely</i> important.

813
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,249
I think it'll lead you
on a very interesting path.

814
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:05,518
So, Larry,
I know you wanted us

815
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,821
to try to help your marriage,
with that, but,

816
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:10,923
we did help
your daughters out.

817
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,258
I mean, I can't blame
everything

818
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,559
on everybody else.

819
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:17,263
I gotta look at myself,
too, you know.

820
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:19,265
Did we ever get more
than I thought we would get.

821
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:22,735
We were just hoping
to not be crazy.

822
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,737
It's overwhelming,

823
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:27,206
but, at the same time,
I'm relieved.

824
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:31,811
The dead are causing
a lot of issues

825
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:33,279
for Larry and his family,

826
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:37,583
but I believe their problems go
much deeper than the paranormal.

827
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:40,286
With the help of a medium,
the dead will be set free

828
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:41,654
and, with the help
of counseling,

829
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:43,756
so will the living,
as this dark,

830
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:45,925
negative goop
will begin to dissipate.
