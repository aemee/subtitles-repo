1
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,380
A living person who lives here
was horribly abused.

2
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,915
This person has PK.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,282
Something just jumped in me.

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,986
I think I would
have freaked out.

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,386
I think that she's seen it.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,791
So you think whatever's here
is capable of killing your guys?

7
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,424
Oh, I think it is.

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,628
Is it trying to kill her?

9
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:28,960
Yeah.

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,132
I just see the word death.

11
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,802
I just hear death.

12
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,402
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,538
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,042
I see dead people.
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,109
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,711
He's like,
"You think you can stop me?

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,713
Because you can't."

18
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:48,215
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,648
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

20
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,552
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,421
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

22
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:56,023
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,556
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,293
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

25
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:00,526
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

26
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,663
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

27
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,765
They're everywhere.
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,837
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

29
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,537
But Steve and I never speak.

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,774
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:14,974
Until the very end.

32
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,474
This dead guy
doing that to her?

33
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,543
- When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay... - That's it.

34
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,481
Or time to get out...

35
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,486
Somebody's gonna
die over there soon, yeah.

36
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,304
I'm in Santa Rosa Beach,
Florida, just east of Pensacola.

37
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,839
Now, this place
may look like paradise,

38
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,675
but I got a call from a guy
who says he's living in hell.

39
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,246
He says whatever's in the house
is scaring his family to death.

40
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,513
Even worse, he's convinced

41
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,550
it's going
after his grown-up daughter.

42
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,552
He sounded really stressed
on the phone

43
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,421
and said we're
his very last hope.

44
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,092
Before Amy arrives,

45
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,463
I clear the house
of any leading information.

46
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,697
Family photographs

47
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,169
and other personal items
can influence her findings,

48
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:17,171
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

49
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,470
When I'm finished,

50
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,674
the location'll be ready
for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:37,424
There's a male,
an older male grabbing me.

52
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,228
He's, uh, really not good.

53
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:44,229
And he, um,

54
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,499
is a big problem here.

55
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,602
They can physically feel him.

56
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,903
Uh, he can, like,

57
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,106
you know, touch 'em, grab 'em.

58
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,808
He's grabbing me.

59
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,319
So, Steve, I gotta tell you,
this is one of the few cases

60
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,222
in all I've done, that the man
of the house has called us in.

61
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,657
What the hell's going on here?

62
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,212
We were just bombarded
with activity here.

63
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,732
It's just to the point
we gotta get some help.

64
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,751
I -- I just feel
like without the help,

65
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,661
I think it would
kill somebody eventually

66
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:24,536
if we didn't get
something done to it.

67
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,040
So you think whatever's here
is capable of killing your guys?

68
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,173
Oh, I think it is.

69
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,541
Is it affecting everybody?

70
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,477
I think it's
affecting everybody.

71
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,578
Okay.

72
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,147
Who exactly lives
in the house with you?

73
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:37,783
- Well, this is my wife, Donna.
- Okay.

74
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,886
This is Steven Jr.

75
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:41,654
He's 18.

76
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,090
This is my step-daughter,
Brittney.

77
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,492
- Okay.
- This is her fiance, Jason.

78
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,746
And then Nikola
is my other step-daughter.

79
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,965
Okay. What exactly are you guys
going through?

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,464
What experiences are you having?

81
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:58,005
Well, we're having knocks,
whispers, uh, things moving,

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,775
um, shadows and some attacks,

83
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,074
physical attacks.

84
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,677
And the depression
is so bad around here,

85
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,916
it -- it's just hardly
any peace around the house

86
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,850
anymore whatsoever.

87
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,352
Lately, we're all separated.

88
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,257
And we -- we never
do anything together.

89
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,876
Everybody stays in their room.

90
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,426
It's really hard to live here.

91
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,696
So which daughter
are you worried about?

92
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,930
Brittney.

93
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,332
Okay, what's going on with her?

94
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,268
She's just totally
drained of energy.

95
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:31,770
She can't walk over 30 feet.

96
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,074
She can't stand for any length
of time at all.

97
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:35,273
We've gone to every doctor.

98
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,909
We've just not found
any answers we --

99
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,276
we're looking for.

100
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,846
I -- I assume she can't work.

101
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,246
She can't.

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,015
It breaks our heart.

103
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,084
With all the stuff you've been
going through, why call us now?

104
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,518
What -- what change?

105
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,357
The physical attacks
have just gotten worse.

106
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:53,627
And then my son comes to me

107
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,927
and he has a bite.

108
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,295
And that's when we decided

109
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,332
we have to do something
about it.

110
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,166
It's extremely hard

111
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,571
to see your kids
get tortured like this.

112
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,046
A living person
got hit here

113
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,284
by this man.

114
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,390
These living people,
they have a lot of pain.

115
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,828
He's always grabbing someone
at the neck.

116
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:31,265
That grip, he's got, like,
this **** grip

117
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,998
that'll make, like,
their ear hurt,

118
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,334
their neck hurt,
their, you know,

119
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,535
all in here, having,

120
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,607
like, major, like,
**** pain.

121
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:44,609
He has to have his hands on you.

122
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,214
Like, he has to have his hands
on you.

123
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,421
So why'd you bring me in here?

124
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,341
We're seeing shadows
all the time.

125
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:00,192
Okay, where are you
seeing them?

126
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,361
They're originating
from the middle of the hall

127
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,065
and they're coming down
through here toward the kitchen.

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,734
It seemed like its about
6 to 7 foot tall,

129
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,834
solid black mass.

130
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,103
- Is it shaped like a human?
- Yes.

131
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,622
This is a quiet block.

132
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,107
Nobody's walking by.

133
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,208
Very quiet.

134
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,012
You don't even have cars
coming by here very often.

135
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,098
Okay.
So anything else?

136
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,042
Well, we're hearing voices.

137
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:24,916
I'll get up, there again,

138
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,603
assuming it's one of the kids.

139
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,614
We get up,
I go down the hallway,

140
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,590
I look in every single bedroom.

141
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,726
Never any of 'em.

142
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:33,694
Okay.

143
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,270
I think that old dude
comes in here a lot.

144
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,373
He gets really mad in here.
I don't know why.

145
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:50,861
He, like, he pitches a fit.

146
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:55,280
The living might hear, like,

147
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,950
I don't know if he,
like, stomps around,

148
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,551
or yelling.

149
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,388
They would hear him go
**** ballistic in here.

150
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,211
Okay.
So anything else?

151
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,161
Yeah, I got poked twice.

152
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,700
I was laying in bed,
uh, early morning.

153
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:17,502
And I felt a poke
on my backside.

154
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,340
I get up and then
I got poked again in the bedroom

155
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,109
and it left a big bruise.

156
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,709
All right.
So is it possible

157
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,813
in the middle of the night
you might have poked yourself

158
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,882
or hit yourself against
something, caused that bruise?

159
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,048
No, I don't think so.

160
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,417
How are you living like this?

161
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,753
If this activity continues,
we're done.

162
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,255
I mean, there's no question.

163
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,722
We can't live like this.

164
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,196
The dude who was, like,
grabbing me, he's just

165
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,262
**** torturing everybody.

166
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,384
The thing is, is,
like, he's hurting people.

167
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,471
Head and neck and upper back
on the right side.

168
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,309
Bad guy.
Torturer, torturer.

169
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,746
So when I was talking to Steve,

170
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,217
he said to me he thinks
that whatever's in this house

171
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,484
is causing your illness...

172
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,487
...and it's trying to basically kill you.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,256
You agree with that at all?

174
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:16,695
It's hard
for me to agree with that.

175
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,698
I want it to be something

176
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,935
that the doctors
can physically find

177
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,622
so that they don't
think I'm crazy.

178
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:27,274
Okay. That's understandable.
All right.

179
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,840
What are the symptoms?

180
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,145
It's a lot like having
the flu all the time.

181
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,416
Blurry vision, headache,
stomach ache, just --

182
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,786
it's been tough just,
you know, standing.

183
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,253
It's almost like,

184
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:46,826
uh, something is squeezing
my spine or something.

185
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,427
And it's very intense.

186
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:52,098
So I've mostly just
been bedridden,

187
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,900
because it's overwhelming.

188
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,637
Have you experienced anything
paranormal in this house,

189
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:58,837
anything unusual?

190
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,373
I've been scratched recently.

191
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,677
So how deep of a cut
are we talking about?

192
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,879
I -- I took a picture.

193
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,651
Let me see your nails.
All right.

194
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:12,951
You could scratch yourself

195
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,154
but you don't think
you did it yourself.

196
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,356
I don't think I did it.

197
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,489
Okay. Anything else?

198
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,294
I've been having
these nightmares.

199
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,028
Okay.

200
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,531
What kinda nightmares
are we talking about?

201
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:29,636
It feels like I'm
leaving my body.

202
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,870
All I see is black.

203
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,874
And then when I do wake up,

204
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:37,042
I wake up startled

205
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,829
and I wake up gasping
and shoot up in bed.

206
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:42,582
Okay. How often are you
having this dream?

207
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,649
Um, weekly.

208
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,154
I can't say that what's going
on with you is paranormal.

209
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,675
Um, I kinda hope it is,
to be honest with you,

210
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,161
so maybe Amy can come up
with something to fix it.

211
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,828
Yeah, I want to be independent.

212
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:02,569
And it's very hard for me
to have to live like this.

213
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,203
I bet it is.

214
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,074
Somebody's in the bed.

215
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,696
Ew, aye-yi-yi-yi!

216
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,782
Oh, dear God.

217
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,950
I feel sick.

218
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,855
Nah, I hear a woman screaming.

219
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,121
She's gasping.

220
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,760
She's waking up
from a nightmare.

221
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,796
So yeah, they're having a lot --

222
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,233
a **** ton of issues here.

223
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:35,669
And I feel sick, horribly ill.

224
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,305
I don't like this bed.

225
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,692
I don't like
this area.

226
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,737
I just see the word death.

227
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,747
I just see
the word death.

228
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,363
♪♪

229
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,437
So, Donna, Brittney's gotta
be concerning for you.

230
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,736
She's a beautiful girl.

231
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,872
You wouldn't think she's sick.

232
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,706
And she's real sick.

233
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,610
She was active and she had
to give up her school

234
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:20,112
and file for disability.

235
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,214
Breaks my heart.

236
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,317
What kind of experiences
have you had, if any?

237
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:27,104
I was standing
at the stove, cooking,

238
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,856
and a magnet
flew off the fridge at me

239
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,323
and landed right by me.

240
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,710
It's like somebody picked it up
and threw it at me.

241
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,063
I can't see how the hell
that could have happened.

242
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,296
I'm amazed myself.

243
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,533
'Cause, I mean, I was in shock.

244
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,735
All right.
Anything else happen?

245
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,437
I was making coffee

246
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,836
and, uh,

247
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,675
I felt someone come up
and put their arms around me.

248
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,277
- Okay, I'm assuming you thought
it was your husband? - Yeah.

249
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,112
So what happened?

250
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,347
- You turn around and
there's nobody there? - Yeah.

251
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,483
I think I would
have freaked out.

252
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,850
I did.

253
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,852
After going through everything
that I've gone through,

254
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,625
I don't want my daughter to have
to go through it or my children.

255
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,161
What do you mean,
after what you've gone through?

256
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:12,564
Um, I was molested
when I was 7 years old.

257
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,636
It was traumatizing,
someone I trusted.

258
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,170
Yeah, no doubt.
Well, I'm glad

259
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,540
you, uh, opened up
to me about that.

260
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,007
That's why we called you guys.

261
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,376
We need help.

262
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,112
Okay.

263
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,836
I think that somebody
who is here

264
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:35,589
was horribly abused as a child.

265
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,688
Uh, a living person

266
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,026
who lives here
was horribly abused.

267
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,964
I -- I don't know
how they were abused.

268
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,865
This person has PK.

269
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,371
PK manifestations usually come
from a living person.

270
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:52,770
And when that person gets angry,

271
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,675
it subconsciously sends energy
to that entity.

272
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,944
And that's when all hell
can break loose.

273
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,646
How does
the PK manifest?

274
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,314
[ Rattling handle ]

275
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,317
Lots of this sh--
kind of crap.

276
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,120
Things disappear.

277
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,424
And, like, literally
they're disappearing.

278
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,492
Like, I mean, like,
into thin air.

279
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,845
I do see, like,
people getting hurt.

280
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,198
So she's essentially
torturing herself.

281
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,938
Okay, so, Donna,
this is your master bedroom.

282
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:25,589
Yes.

283
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:26,170
Mm'kay.

284
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,306
So I assume
you brought me in here

285
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,407
because you've had experiences.

286
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,476
Yes, I have, several.

287
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:30,475
Okay, what happened?

288
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,395
Um, my husband was laying here

289
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,245
and I was laying next to him.

290
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,250
But I saw a dark,
dark black mass just

291
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,451
hovering over him.

292
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,104
Kind of a swirly light,
but it was solid black.

293
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,723
And it was nothing
coming from outside causing

294
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,824
that that you could tell?

295
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,575
I looked.

296
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,291
Okay.

297
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,758
Anything else in here?

298
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,130
A few times when I would be
about ready to go to sleep,

299
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,850
I felt like something
just jumped in me.

300
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,535
So now, when Amy talks
about getting jumped,

301
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,488
she's talking
about a dead person

302
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,372
actually jumping into her body.

303
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,975
Is that the same feeling
you're getting?

304
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,475
- Yeah, that's what
it feels like. - Okay.

305
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,713
Just queasy feeling all over.

306
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,432
Doesn't feel well.

307
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,081
I'm afraid to ask

308
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,484
if anything else
is going on in this room.

309
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,904
Uh, yeah.
I've had something

310
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,254
crawl across my legs in the bed.

311
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,691
I mean, I could feel
the indentation in the bed.

312
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,091
Now you have a small dog,

313
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,428
so you know
what that feels like.

314
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:22,693
Oh, yeah.
But, uh, she --

315
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,130
she doesn't even
come in this room.

316
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,396
She won't sleep in here.

317
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,165
So she sleeps in with Brittney.

318
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,835
I mean, how the hell
are you sleeping at night?

319
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,570
We don't much.

320
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,810
This thing's, like,
laying like that.

321
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,313
And then it, like,
went like this and then

322
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,114
it went like that.

323
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,584
And then it had a head,

324
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,854
arms and hands.

325
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,425
I'm confused about what it is.

326
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,995
It's been attached to a female

327
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,864
since she was little.

328
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,666
I think that she's seen it.

329
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,504
I think it's caused a lot
of problems

330
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,405
throughout this person's life.

331
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,143
I think that there's been
struggles

332
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:13,179
with addictions manifesting,

333
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,046
OCDs on and off.

334
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,450
And it's because of this thing

335
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,820
that has been
latched onto her.

336
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,074
It takes your energy from you.

337
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:28,327
And so then you can't stand up

338
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,261
and you can't walk.

339
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,096
You have to just lay down.

340
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,299
Her and the ****
thing take energy.

341
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,405
And so that's bad for anybody
who, like, lives with her.

342
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,107
Is it
trying to hurt her?

343
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,673
Yeah.

344
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,860
It does, her whole life.

345
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,013
Is it trying to
kill her?

346
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,927
So I've already reached
out to a bunch of locals:

347
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,300
cops, journalists, historians,
anyone who might give me a lead.

348
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:09,402
I just got a call
back from a genealogist,

349
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,469
who says a previous owner
of the property

350
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,205
was a well-known
attorney general

351
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,639
who went after the mob

352
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,742
and may have paid
for it with his life.

353
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,033
So Diane, this guy
you were talking about

354
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,818
on the phone
to me sounds pretty interesting.

355
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,017
What's his story?

356
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,821
He was an interesting guy.

357
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,555
This is Robert Bushnell.

358
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,492
When did he wind up
buying my client's property?

359
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,395
In 1944, he bought it
with his mother, Mary.

360
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,331
And they were going
to develop it

361
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,484
as a business interest.

362
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,567
Okay.
So did he live here?

363
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,071
No, his mother did.
He would come down...

364
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,305
...and visit often.
- Okay.

365
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,159
And you mentioned he was
an attorney general.

366
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,944
Yes, he was, in the state
of Massachusetts.

367
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,049
Okay, so what kind of a guy
was he as an attorney general?

368
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,649
He had a reputation
of being really tough.

369
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,920
He was known to be very
short-tempered as well,

370
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,855
in and out of the court room.

371
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,725
Now, Diane, you mentioned
he went after the mob.

372
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,257
Uh, what did you mean by that?

373
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,596
Well, in Boston there was
a very popular nightclub...

374
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,163
...run by the mob,
called the Cocoanut Grove. - Okay.

375
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:18,036
And in 1942,
there was horrendous fire

376
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,806
there that killed 492 people.

377
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,005
Wow.

378
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,310
There were code violations,
clearly.

379
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,610
Doors were locked.

380
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,565
And Robert Bushnell
went after the owners

381
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,519
and got convictions
for 19 manslaughters.

382
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,786
In fact, there was
an article here.

383
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:41,694
The main owner was put away
for from 12 to 15 years.

384
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,628
Well, the way it sounds,

385
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,129
how this guy went
after the mob,

386
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,334
he might have, uh,
had some targets on him.

387
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,737
I'm sure he did, yes.

388
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,744
I'm seeing the old guy
who grabbed me again.

389
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,678
You know anything
about him in life?

390
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,446
I know he moved here.

391
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm gonna say probably from back
east somewhere.

392
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:09,320
He's talking about ownership.

393
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,491
He owned, like,
a business, I think.

394
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,311
I feel like he was,
like, established.

395
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:18,062
He's gotta
control everything, I guess.

396
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:23,436
There was also something
important about a fire.

397
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:31,176
And so the fire,
that was a problem.

398
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,947
I'm getting the fire big time,
big time, again.

399
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:37,181
Whew!
****

400
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,052
Ooh-wee, it's hot.

401
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,608
So, Diane,
I understand his death

402
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:47,226
might've been
a little suspicious.

403
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:48,593
So what happened?

404
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:54,033
In 1949, he returned from
Washington, D.C. one night

405
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,702
and went up
to his residential suite

406
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,569
in a hotel in New York City

407
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,906
and gave instructions
to the front desk people

408
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,407
not to disturb him
for the weekend.

409
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,580
And a couple of days later,
he was found dead in his bed.

410
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,514
Okay.
So I got a few questions.

411
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,117
I mean, what was the cause
of death, number one?

412
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,585
They ruled it a heart attack.

413
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,088
Okay.
How old was he at the time.

414
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,322
He was only 53.

415
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,257
Any health issues?
Was he obese?

416
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,028
He was a little bit
overweight for his size,

417
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,429
but nothing that came out,

418
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,034
as far as a disease
or anything like that.

419
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,771
He had few friends
and many enemies.

420
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:34,507
It could have been
a number of things.

421
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:43,014
This guy who grabs people
is kind of...

422
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,417
chubby, overweight.

423
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,820
So he didn't eat well.

424
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,254
His heart, man.

425
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,390
Something with his chest
is so wicked bad.

426
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,927
Like, he can't let go of that
****.

427
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,429
He died from, I think,
a heart attack.

428
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,168
Any idea how old
he was when he died?

429
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,571
You know, uh, uh, I would say,

430
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,973
like, you know,
like 60s, 50s,

431
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,339
60s.

432
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,575
So angry that he died.

433
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,214
Maybe he was looking forward
to moving here.

434
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,185
So far, I've got a family
being terrorized

435
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,352
by bizarre activity
on a property

436
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,254
that was once owned
by an attorney general

437
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,789
who died mysteriously.

438
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,357
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

439
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,062
Searching through old records,
I find Charles Cessna,

440
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:31,496
one of the original owners

441
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,816
of the property
and the town's founder.

442
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:36,135
Turns out he was also
a scam artist.

443
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,422
I don't think Donna
and Steve have a clue

444
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,640
the town founder
owned their property.

445
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,410
I'm heading over to meet
with a local journalist

446
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,743
who says Charles Cessna's life

447
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,115
was filled with fraud, lies
and violence.

448
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,222
So Jeffrey, before we get
to this guy, Cessna,

449
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:57,755
and his scams, uh,

450
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,658
what were you able
to find out about him.

451
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,097
Steve, here's the picture
of Dr. Charles Cessna.

452
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,331
He was a medical doctor
in Chicago.

453
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,366
- He was a legitimate doctor?
- No, he was not.

454
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,503
He also was selling placebos

455
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,540
through newspaper
advertisements.

456
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,845
Okay, so this guy was like
a snake oil salesman basically.

457
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,277
Yes.
Yes, sir.

458
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,880
All right.
How'd that work out for him?

459
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,148
He did get busted twice for that

460
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,618
and had
his medical license revoked.

461
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,053
All right.
So let's move onto the scams

462
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,455
in, uh, Santa Rosa Beach.

463
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,259
When does he come down here
and start doing stuff?

464
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,993
- He comes in 1910 and starts
purchasing property. - Okay.

465
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,028
Then, in 1911,

466
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,066
he purchases the property
that your client lives on now.

467
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:44,070
All right. So how's the scam
work for him down here?

468
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,436
Here's an advertisement here

469
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,407
that shows he is selling
10-acre farmland for people.

470
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,043
And when they get here,
much of looks like this,

471
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,645
which is not good farmland,
like is advertised.

472
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,714
- So he tried selling 'em
this crap? - Yes.

473
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,549
What about this scam?

474
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,853
Does he get caught,
go to jail?

475
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,253
Apparently he does not.

476
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,857
In fact, he makes millions
on selling the land.

477
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,426
All right. So, Jeff, you had
mentioned on the phone

478
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,361
about violence --
what'd you mean by that?

479
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:13,498
Well, 1917, Mr. Cessna
is a married man

480
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,068
with three children who's
carrying on an affair

481
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,604
with a young woman
that was working for him,

482
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,038
named Julia Murphy.

483
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,340
Here's a photograph of her.

484
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,345
As they were breaking up,
Cessna flips out, beats her

485
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,247
and drags her around the office
by the hair.

486
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:29,546
All right.
So what happened?

487
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,817
I mean, he just
gets away with it?

488
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,216
He does not.
She --

489
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,354
she ultimately sues him
for firing her.

490
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,321
Okay, so how's that lawsuit go?

491
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,461
He eventually has to pay
$30,000 to Miss Murphy.

492
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:42,694
That's a lot of money back then.

493
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,364
It certainly is.

494
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,303
I'm seeing a young woman.

495
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:55,291
This dead girl,

496
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:59,210
she got an impact

497
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:04,449
on the right side
of her head and neck.

498
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,185
There's something
about her being, I think,

499
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,054
on a date when she got killed.

500
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,424
She has, like, brown hair

501
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,793
to about here and brown eyes.

502
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,160
And she's pretty.
She's young.

503
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,197
I'd say, like, you know,
between, like, I dunno,

504
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,166
like, 17 and,
like, 25, maybe.

505
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:24,035
She's confused and lost.

506
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,270
But she's really angry.

507
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:30,142
She's always running
around the house.

508
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:33,979
She makes people
feel panicky here.

509
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:37,349
She makes them feel fear here.

510
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:40,685
And then they can hear her, um,

511
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,921
yelling out, yelling.

512
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,726
And, like, I'm having neck...

513
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,695
really bad.

514
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,630
Oh **** ****.

515
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,902

00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,738
unexplained activity

and we'll help if we can.

520
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,656
So another thing
caught my eye in research:

521
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,327
The original owner
of Steve and Donna's property

522
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,530
seems to have suffered
a lot of tragedy.

523
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:25,663
I'm heading over
to meet a local historian

524
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,534
who says his story
will definitely help my case.

525
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,409
So Brenda, I came
across this guy,

526
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,780
Henry Reddick, uh, who lived
on my client's property.

527
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,312
And I know he'd lost a few kids.

528
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,417
But before we get to that,
what do you know about this guy?

529
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:48,686
Henry Reddick was born
in Macon, Georgia in 1833.

530
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:52,424
Sometime after that, he moved to
the northwest Florida panhandle...

531
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:53,957
...and -- and settled here.
- Okay.

532
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,293
What'd he do when he came here?

533
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,162
He was in the mill business,
the timber business.

534
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,396
All right.
So if he's born in 1833,

535
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,967
I assume he winds up fighting
in the Civil War.

536
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,686
Yes, he does.
He joins the Confederacy

537
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:07,371
and soon after
that he goes to fight

538
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,275
in his first battle at
what is now Fort Walton Beach.

539
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,242
Uh, how's the war go for him?

540
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,229
Doesn't necessarily
go well for him at all.

541
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,181
He ends up in one of the most
horrific battles

542
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:18,816
of the Civil War
in Franklin, Tennessee.

543
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,055
Over 9,000 are killed and 6,000
of those are Confederates.

544
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,356
He's assigned to burial duty.

545
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,060
He's in charge of burying
all those people.

546
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,331
There's, like,

547
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,300
this big, fancy graveyard.

548
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:40,739
I've never seen,
like, so many graves.

549
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:43,275
It's, like, packed,

550
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,742
packed, full of graves,

551
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,679
one on top of the other,
one on top of the other,

552
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,866
one on top of the other.

553
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,983
There's so many dead people.

554
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,720
This was all bad ****
that went down.

555
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,191
All right.
So I know he survives the war.

556
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,024
So does he come back here?

557
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,727
Yes, he does come back
to the area.

558
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,047
And he marries.
And he and his wife

559
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:07,332
have two children:
Ellen and Etta.

560
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,102
Shortly after Etta was born,
his wife died.

561
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:12,871
All right.
So I know he remarries again.

562
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,472
Uh, when did that happen?

563
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:18,744
In 1874, he marries a widow
whose name is Elizabeth.

564
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,244
Any kids together.

565
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,848
Henry and Elizabeth
have eight children together.

566
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,014
What happened?

567
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,248
Well, out of
those eight children

568
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,586
that Henry and Elizabeth
had together,

569
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,322
three of them died.

570
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,988
Three of the boys

571
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,658
that had died
are buried on that property.

572
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,562
There was a female.

573
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,568
And she has, like, short,
curly, brown hair.

574
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,235
And she's little.

575
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,337
This was back a ways.

576
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,407
And she's, like, freaking out.

577
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,378
She is banging
on a dining room table.

578
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:56,747
She, uh, lost her child.

579
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,351
Her child died.

580
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,860
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk.

581
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,226
But the creature
that's torturing

582
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:13,331
a living woman had me
the most concerned.

583
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:17,201
There was a gigantic bed
in the room.

584
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:23,309
And then this thing
lifted its head to look at me.

585
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,312
It had a human arm

586
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,415
and leg.

587
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,953
Amy, is this what you saw?

588
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,389
Yes.

589
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,644
STEVE: Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

590
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,812
we're ready
to reveal our findings

591
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,746
to each other and our clients

592
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,713
for the first time.

593
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,282
Amy, I'd like you to meet Donna.

594
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,687
This is her daughter, Brittney,
and her husband, Steve.

595
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:11,340
Now everybody's having
a bad time here.

596
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,959
But Steve is convinced
that whatever's here

597
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,660
is trying to kill Brittney.

598
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,399
Now, she may look fine, uh,
but she's not doing well.

599
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,967
She spends most
of her days in bed.

600
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,336
Uh, it's actually
a pretty big deal...

601
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,737
...that you're even sitting here with us,
to be honest. - Yeah.

602
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,071
So, with that,

603
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,041
I'm gonna have Amy
tell us about her walk

604
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,810
and see where it takes us.

605
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:36,064
When I first entered the house,

606
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,283
I saw this enormous graveyard.

607
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,820
It was packed with bodies.

608
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,186
I kept being told

609
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,622
that this was
extremely important

610
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,695
and that it does have something
to do with the land here.

611
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,198
Then, I was shown this female.

612
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,632
And she was pounding on a table

613
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,570
and screaming that her --
I guess a child...

614
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,371
...of hers had just died.
- All right.

615
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,709
So there's a few things
that you should know about.

616
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,642
First off,
there's a graveyard nearby.

617
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,712
I think it's just over a half
a mile from here.

618
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,748
And it was part
of the original property line.

619
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,214
Oh.

620
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,885
Now one of the original owners
of the property

621
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,487
has a direct connection
to the graveyard here.

622
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,791
This guy, Henry Reddick,
he was around in the 1800s,

623
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,258
fought in the Civil War.

624
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,960
Now Henry
and his wife, Elizabeth,

625
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,394
had eight kids together.

626
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,266
Three of them,
including a young infant, died.

627
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,268
And they're all buried
in that cemetery.

628
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,575
The next individual
that I ran into was a male.

629
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,241
And he was older.

630
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,646
Uh, and he's kind
of a big issue here.

631
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:44,400
I saw him attacking
living people,

632
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:47,084
trying to physically
torture people.

633
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,621
Like, I encounter this guy
and he's got a grip on me.

634
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,289
Like, he's holding me.

635
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:57,229
I think he can possibly
jump people as well.

636
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,498
Donna, tell Amy
what you experienced.

637
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,733
Yeah, I'm getting
ready for bed.

638
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:03,534
And I'm just relaxing.

639
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,355
And I feel just
the weirdest feeling.

640
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,066
It's almost like choking,
nausea.

641
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,708
And I just jumped totally
out of bed.

642
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,012
I felt like somebody
just went through me,

643
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:15,047
just terrorizing me.

644
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,513
It's shocking.

645
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:21,186
The reason why he does
this is to dominate and control.

646
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:25,824
I think that the living
would experience this dead guy

647
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,359
in several different ways.

648
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:28,825
Uh, so I think
the head, neck

649
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,631
and upper back would be uh,
a issue when he's around.

650
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,366
- Now, you've also been...
- Touched...

651
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,768
Tell Amy how you...

652
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,905
In the kitchen,
I felt somebody come around

653
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,373
and grab me around my waist.

654
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,661
I gotta show you
something else.

655
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,914
Brittney here
has been scratched.

656
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,483
Okay.
Wow.

657
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,053
I woke up one morning,
looked into the bathroom

658
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,888
and I notice these scratches

659
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,823
here, uh,

660
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,792
along here and down on my leg.

661
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,926
And it's just...

662
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,781
I didn't have
an explanation for them.

663
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:09,893
And this is what happened
to Steve's son.

664
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,936
He came out of his room
and he was terrified.

665
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,141
Uh, we knew we had
to call somebody at that point.

666
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:18,343
Okay. Any idea who this guy
might be in life.

667
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,779
I think he moved here
at some point

668
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,379
or was about to.

669
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,833
I saw that he had
a business back east.

670
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:27,217
Uh, I got
that there was a fire, uh,

671
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,988
that played a very important
role in his life.

672
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,188
Uh, in fact, my --

673
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,658
my back caught fire
and I --

674
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:36,794
I could feel it burning.

675
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,146
Why'd you guys
have that reaction

676
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,958
when she told you
about this guy?

677
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:43,700
'Cause she's always
got burning pain.

678
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,370
I got that he dropped dead
in his 50s or 60s,

679
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,839
I think from a heart attack.

680
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,009
I got
that he was slightly chubby,

681
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,476
didn't eat very well.

682
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,479
And he's extremely pissed off
about his death

683
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:59,083
because he was really, really
looking forward to moving here.

684
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,085
There is somebody
that could fit the bill.

685
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,584
There's a previous owner
of the land

686
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,755
that comes to mind, actually,
this guy Robert Bushnell.

687
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,557
Uh, he was the attorney general
of Massachusetts.

688
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,913
Uh, in 1944, him and his mother
purchased your property.

689
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:16,235
He didn't live here,
but he came down a lot to visit.

690
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,769
Now this guy was a lawyer
that was known

691
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:18,936
for his hot temper.

692
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,440
His biggest case
that caught my attention

693
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,676
that killed over 490 people.

694
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,842
Now, this fire took place

695
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,796
at a nightclub in Boston
called the Cocoanut Grove.

696
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:31,716
Now Bushnell went
after the Mafia-connected owner

697
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,185
of the nightclub
and sent him to prison.

698
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,654
Now the other thing
was, you said...

699
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:39,255
...the guy died of a heart attack
in his 50s or 60s. - Uh-huh.

700
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,393
In 1949, at the age of 53,
he dies of a heart attack.

701
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:44,194
Wow.

702
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:50,168
Actually found a photo
of him in his 40s.

703
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,070
Is it possible
this is who you saw.

704
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,039
Yes.

705
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,313
The next thing was
down the hall, uh,

706
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,280
and then the right.

707
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,715
So the first thing that I got,

708
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,154
when I walked into that room,
was the word death.

709
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:12,357
Uh, I got that the living female

710
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,425
that is in that room, uh,

711
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,261
is dealing with a lot of issues.

712
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,365
And it's many different types
of issues.

713
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,899
I felt extremely sick in there,

714
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,071
stomach pain,
intense stomach pains.

715
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,874
I saw this female screaming, uh,

716
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,643
gasping, waking form nightmares.

717
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,212
It was a bad situation.

718
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:36,747
That's Brittney's room.

719
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:37,883
That's your room?

720
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:40,016
Interesting.

721
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,218
You know, I look fine,

722
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,506
but inside, it's torture.

723
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:49,793
Um, stomach pains, back pain.

724
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,595
That's what I go through.

725
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,398
And when I'm standing,
it feels like,

726
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,534
almost as if someone's, like,
choking my spine. - Mm-hmm.

727
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,236
I hate to say it,

728
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,672
but it feels like I'm dying.

729
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,910
Now you had nightmares
that we talked about.

730
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:08,644
Yeah, um, it's...
I dream...

731
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,750
I -- I almost feel
like I'm leaving my body.

732
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,919
And this fear overwhelms me.

733
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:20,559
And I'm yelling at myself,
screaming to wake up.

734
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:22,124
Mm-hmm.

735
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,730
And I wake up just
terrified, startled.

736
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:33,238
The next thing
that I encountered was

737
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:34,470
in the master bedroom area.

738
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,007
I got that there was
a living female in there

739
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,110
who was horribly
abused as a child.

740
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,047
I got that she has struggled
with addictions

741
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,713
and possibly struggles with OCD.

742
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,884
Uh, this living woman
is also a sensitive,

743
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:50,653
possibly a physical medium.

744
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,556
I was hoping we were gonna
have to bring this up.

745
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,160
But it's kind of important
at this point.

746
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,396
You had some abuse issues
as a child.

747
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,166
Yeah, I was
7, 8 years old.

748
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,453
And somebody I trusted,

749
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:07,705
uh, attempted to molest me.

750
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,645
And I thought that's something
I put behind me.

751
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,980
Obviously you didn't put it
behind you.

752
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:17,716
Probably not.

753
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,637
So the thing I'm most
concerned about

754
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:25,556
was in the master bedroom area
as well.

755
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,859
While I was in there,
I thought I saw, like,

756
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,693
a big throw blanket

757
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,330
at the end of the bed, um,

758
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,230
but no, it wasn't.

759
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,033
So I'm looking
and I'm like, "Huh."

760
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,635
And it raises its head.

761
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,408
And then it just slid
right off the bed.

762
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,377
It's attached
to the living woman.

763
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,312
Uh, it's been attached
to her since,

764
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:50,213
actually, she was very young.

765
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,717
And I saw a scene
of this thing with the --

766
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,186
with the female in bed.

767
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,621
And I had that sketched.

768
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,827
Well, this ain't good.

769
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,729
BRITTNEY: Oh, my gosh.

770
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,298
Oh, yeah.

771
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,335
- That's probably what I saw
hovering over you. - Yeah.

772
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,540
Probably what I saw that night.

773
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,010
At least I know I'm not nuts.
But I feel nuts.

774
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:20,879
I felt something
crawl across the bed.

775
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,714
So you think it might
have been that?

776
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,483
Yeah, I'm sure.

777
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,182
Looks like it.

778
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,121
That thing
is a PK manifestation.

779
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,628
What is so fascinating about it
is that this is something

780
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:39,064
that you've had attached
to you since childhood,

781
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,366
which I've never,
ever, ever seen before.

782
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:46,971
Because it has somewhat
formed a personality of its own,

783
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,374
it can now do things
separate from you, uh,

784
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,674
to living indi--
individuals.

785
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,562
Um, so if you get angry,
it gets angry.

786
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:57,416
So the scratch marks
and the bruises,

787
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,217
could that be coming from Donna?

788
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:02,385
From your subconscious.

789
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,972
And when she gets angry
or upset,

790
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:07,490
she's able
to make objects disappear.

791
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,563
Yeah, she's always complaining
that something's missing.

792
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,598
Well, that's something
that's common with --

793
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,965
with mediums in general.

794
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,386
But she's not the only one
with abilities.

795
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:21,738
So the thing is,
I sat down at the table,

796
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,376
the first thing I got with you
was psychic empath healer.

797
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:28,680
And the problem
with being a psychic empath

798
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:31,784
is that you're
in close proximity

799
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,853
with someone
who is a physical medium

800
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,053
who has flaring PK.

801
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,174
And so she's drawing
a lot of energy

802
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:41,225
from everyone in the house
to the point

803
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,028
where it's draining you
and making you sick.

804
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,628
Oh, God.

805
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,734
Like, a lot of people will refer
to it as psychic vampirism.

806
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:54,406
Did all this start because of
what happened to Donna as a kid?

807
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,039
Yeah.

808
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,226
So it's like you're
torturing yourself.

809
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:00,154
You blame yourself for a lot
of ****

810
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:02,047
that happened
when you were a kid.

811
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,216
Yeah.

812
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,885
Like, um, in a dream or...

813
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,588
It don't seem right.
That's for sure.

814
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,357
Surreal.

815
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,427
Well, guys, we got a lot
of answers tonight.

816
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:36,179
We know why Brittney's
been so sick, uh,

817
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:39,884
why everybody's been
so depressed and drained, uh,

818
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:43,086
and why things have actually
gotten so physical.

819
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,523
But what we still don't know is
whether you guys can stay here

820
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,924
and live together peacefully
as a family.

821
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,194
Uh, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

822
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,532
This is something
that can be dealt with,

823
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:59,270
although it will require
lifestyle changes and things

824
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:00,705
that you'll have
to do consistently

825
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,340
for the rest of your life.

826
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,913
Donna, I would like you
to find a psychotherapist.

827
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,346
You need an outlet.

828
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,250
And that's going to be
a really good outlet

829
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:14,069
for you to feel comfortable
in a space

830
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,854
that you can share
anything and everything

831
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,320
that's bothering you.

832
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,226
And by you verbalizing it
and getting it out of you,

833
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,995
you're taking away power
from this --

834
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,797
this sucker that's formed.

835
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,732
Steve: Will that make this thing
that's manifested

836
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,967
start to dissipate?

837
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,304
Yes, yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

838
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,041
And the thing is,
is by doing all of these things,

839
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:38,441
um, it'll --

840
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,211
it'll lead you
on a very interesting path

841
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,446
in your life.

842
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:45,049
The other thing
now is for Brittney.

843
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,484
You need to learn reiki.

844
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,357
Uh, this is going to balance
your energy and your abilities.

845
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:56,061
You're never gonna be completely
back to normal.

846
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,866
But you'll start having
more better days than worse.

847
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,052
I am thankful, like, for this.

848
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:06,613
I -- I am so grateful, um,

849
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,694
just to better, you know,

850
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:10,741
even a little bit better.

851
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,910
That works for me.

852
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,314
The other thing is,
as far as the house and, like,

853
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,214
all the energy that's here,

854
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,384
you need a reiki master
to come in

855
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,686
and completely balance
the energy here,

856
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,323
remove what doesn't need to be
here anymore and bring in light,

857
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,156
love and positivity

858
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,160
and to set up boundaries
for the dead.

859
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,528
So I never heard you say

860
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,631
before reiki master
removing the dead before.

861
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,166
They're gonna remove
negative energy.

862
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,237
But what they'll do
is also set up boundaries

863
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:41,871
so that the dead
can't come in anymore.

864
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,676
So does that mean this guy
Bushnell will be out of here

865
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,463
or he'll be not allowed back
in the house?

866
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:50,215
Yeah, he won't be allowed
back in the house.

867
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,782
You gonna take
her advice, Britt?

868
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,118
Definitely.

869
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:54,135
Okay.

870
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,118
- Donna?
- Oh, yeah.

871
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,753
You're on board.

872
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,157
Now I just gotta make sure
they do what they're gonna do.

873
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,942
I mean, this is a big relief.

874
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,692
I mean, just the mentalness

875
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,431
of her knowing that something
can be done is a lot.

876
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:07,864
- It's hard to forgive yourself.
- Yeah.

877
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,299
All right.

878
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,337
But you're not doing just
for you now.

879
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,004
You're doing it for your family.

880
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,272
Yes.

881
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,975
That's important to me.

882
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,444
And you can't be guilty.

883
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,381
I mean,
my family's too important to me.

884
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,352
And I'll do what I gotta do.

885
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,522
AMY: I can't imagine
the pain Donna

886
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,892
feels, knowing
she's manifested an entity

887
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,793
that's tormenting her family.

888
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,963
But, with the help
of a psychotherapist

889
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:40,330
and a reiki master,

890
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,600
they can banish the dead
and weaken the PK,

891
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,304
allowing them to lead
a peaceful life.
