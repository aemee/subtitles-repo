1
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:12,745
Somebody's gonna die over there.

2
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:16,363
This house wants people's soul.

3
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,167
There's this man. He
makes them kill themselves.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,638
They each suffered
fatal blows to the head.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,839
She was attacked.

6
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,710
Mommy wasn't acting
right. Something's wrong.

7
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,545
He's insane.

8
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,649
This seems like a possession.

9
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,319
I just hear death.

10
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,588
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,222
God.

12
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:44,224
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

13
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:45,326
I see dead people.

14
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:46,594
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,329
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,131
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

17
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,533
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,068
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,204
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:59,206
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

21
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,774
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,343
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,078
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,579
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

25
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,782
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:09,950
They're everywhere.

27
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:11,352
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,420
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

29
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,223
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:18,258
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,493
...until the very end...

32
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:21,161
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

33
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:23,030
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,132
That's it.

35
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,400
...or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:30,638
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,022
I'm in East Flat Rock, North Carolina.

38
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,457
It's about 30 minutes from Asheville.

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,860
I got a call from a
young woman named Briana.

40
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,262
Now, this poor kid's
story broke my heart.

41
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:58,298
Both her parents died violently
while living in the house,

42
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,067
and she blames it on the paranormal.

43
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,603
Now, she thinks whatever killed them

44
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,238
wants to take her out next.

45
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,545
Before Amy arrives,
I have to clear the area

46
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,014
of anything that could
influence her findings.

47
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,686
Personal items, photographs,
and religious texts

48
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,821
have to be covered or removed.

49
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:24,391
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

50
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:37,805
There's something
weird about religion here.

51
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,673
Their faith has been lost.

52
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,975
Who is it you're
saying lost their faith?

53
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,944
The people who live here.

54
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:47,414
There's this man...

55
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,849
and he's creepy.

56
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,352
This crazy, manic guy

57
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,757
manipulated them into
losing their faith.

58
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,394
He's, thin, tall, white.

59
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,629
He looks young. You
know, he looks like...

60
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:05,165
I don't know...
you know, 20s maybe.

61
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:08,469
He turns you from the good to the bad.

62
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,540
That has something to do with
why they lost their faith.

63
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,376
And it's because he's just...

64
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,012
He's rancid.

65
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,121
So, Briana, when
we spoke on the phone,

66
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,255
you sounded pretty upset.

67
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,623
Now that we're here,

68
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,459
what are you hoping
that we can do for you?

69
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:35,162
I want to be able to keep this home

70
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,798
and not be afraid to come in here.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,100
I grew up here.

72
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,736
I just don't want to give it up.

73
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:45,939
There's just so much
family history here.

74
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:49,042
So, before we get to that,
what's going on in the house?

75
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,178
I hear sounds.

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,247
I see shadows.

77
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,716
Things move on their own.

78
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:58,752
And while we're in the house,

79
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:03,690
we have health problems and mood swings.

80
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,392
So now, who do you live here with?

81
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,494
My fiancé, Tracy.

82
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,264
So obviously, the
activity here now is bad.

83
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,966
Was it like that when
you were growing up?

84
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,101
Yes.

85
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:19,239
But when my dad passed
away, it really picked up.

86
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,542
Let's talk about what
happened with your father

87
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,644
and how he died.

88
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,679
He was going down the road.

89
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:30,884
And they found his truck
flipped over on its side,

90
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,719
no skid marks, nothing.

91
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,489
The truck barely looked wrecked.

92
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,691
- Did they deem it an accident?
- Yes.

93
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,626
What do you think happened?

94
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,962
Whatever is in here

95
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:46,900
could have messed with
him or the vehicle.

96
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:52,472
It seems like we're not meant
to have anybody in this house.

97
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,010
So I know this is tough
to talk about, sweetie,

98
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,679
but what exactly happened with Mom?

99
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,949
She committed suicide.

100
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,284
It'll be 2 years in November.

101
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:10,057
Mom was the happiest,
nicest person in the world.

102
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,792
Was there anything in her life

103
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,694
that might have got her depressed?

104
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:16,063
There was a renter,

105
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,299
about 8 months before my mom passed,

106
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,335
she found passed away.

107
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,736
You remember her name?

108
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,104
Laquada.

109
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,840
They were very good friends.

110
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:28,542
How did your mom commit suicide?

111
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:32,112
With a shotgun that I bought her

112
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,481
on the back porch.

113
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:41,154
I feel real... really guilty
since I bought her the gun.

114
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:43,190
Don't blame yourself.

115
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,727
If people want to commit
suicide, they're gonna do it.

116
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,228
Do you think the paranormal

117
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,664
had something to do
with your mom's death?

118
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,967
Whatever is in this
house is very strong.

119
00:05:53,969 --> 00:06:00,207
I think it could have got
to her and made her do that.

120
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,944
This house wants people's soul.

121
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,018
Okay. Somebody's
talking about a suicide.

122
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,588
Something from in this direction

123
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,391
made somebody kill themselves.

124
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:20,427
And somebody's talking about,

125
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,062
"It makes you feel depressed.

126
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:24,064
It makes you feel weak,
weak, weak in the knees.

127
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,399
Weak in the knees."

128
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,667
Okay. Okay.

129
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,202
Really bad neck pain
here, really **** bad.

130
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:31,872
****

131
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,975
****

132
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:40,013
I'm seeing something
crawling out of water,

133
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,748
something, a man.

134
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,083
Nasty, nasty.

135
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,718
He died bad, bad.

136
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,354
And he's, like, revenge.
He's all about it.

137
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:53,160
He influences people that he dislikes,

138
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,429
and then he makes them kill themselves.

139
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,466
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

140
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:09,142
I haven't moved
much since she passed.

141
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:12,279
I just want to keep
things how she left it.

142
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,347
So tell me about

143
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,681
some experiences you've had in the room.

144
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,651
About a month after my dad passed,

145
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,019
I wrote a note,

146
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,855
this note right over here.

147
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,123
Okay. That's the note?

148
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,725
Yes.

149
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,195
And I wrote, "I love you, Dad.

150
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,930
Please sign this every night."

151
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:34,534
He initialed it.

152
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,005
Are you sure your mom didn't
get up in the middle of the night

153
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,606
and sign this for you
to make you feel better?

154
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,607
I'm sure.

155
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,509
You can see her handwriting on the back.

156
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:45,946
It doesn't match up.

157
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,781
Anything else going on in this room?

158
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,917
One day, I went to get in the shower.

159
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,686
I laid my phone down.

160
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,588
And I came out,

161
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,857
and my phone was in
three different pieces.

162
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,658
Anybody else home?

163
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,827
Tracy was outside doing yard work.

164
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,162
Have any kids in the
neighborhood that...

165
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,564
We don't talk to nobody around here.

166
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,199
It was right after I contacted you guys.

167
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,401
You're kidding.

168
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,769
Whatever's here,

169
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,905
to me, don't want you guys here.

170
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,345
Poltergeist, poltergeist,

171
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,247
poltergeist, poltergeist, poltergeist.

172
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,948
Damn.

173
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,785
They think they have a poltergeist,

174
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,086
but it's really him.

175
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,188
- Who?
- The creepy guy.

176
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,489
He's a manipulator.

177
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,292
There are two powerful
dead people here...

178
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,894
the vengeful guy outside

179
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,563
who wants the living to kill themselves

180
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,964
and the creepy guy in the house

181
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,633
who makes people lose their faith.

182
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:48,275
And I'm, like, seeing this,
like, dark...energy

183
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:53,046
coming in, onto the floor, onto the bed.

184
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,282
It's the creepy guy again.

185
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,616
Aah.

186
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,888
It's like somebody just came
up behind me and went... fomp!

187
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,990
On my back.

188
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:07,160
I can't breathe, and it hurts a lot.

189
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,100
This seems like a possession to me.

190
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,769
Yeah. Somebody's being
possessed by this dude.

191
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,871
I want to say it's a woman.

192
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:21,141
So that's bad.

193
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,483
Okay, so tell
me about the experiences

194
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,685
that you have when you're here.

195
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,488
I see shadows, really tall.

196
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,656
You can see an outline
of, like, a person.

197
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,692
Okay. So where do you see it?

198
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,327
In this corner.

199
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,132
It'll move, like, from
the corner to the door.

200
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,268
It feels evil. It doesn't want us here.

201
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,303
Okay. Why do you say that?

202
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,306
I'll get, like, sick to my stomach

203
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:55,275
when I feel it's there.

204
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,110
My chest will hurt.

205
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,446
My heart will start racing.

206
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,981
Yeah. It sounds like an anxiety attack.

207
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,315
Do you suffer from that?

208
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:03,416
No.

209
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,085
Are you sure?

210
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:08,455
I've tried talking to my
doctor about how sick I feel.

211
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,590
She's like, "You're okay."

212
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:11,925
Anything else?

213
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:16,363
Very weird mood swings
when I'm in the house.

214
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,331
Do you take any kind of
medication on a regular basis?

215
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,466
Nothing.

216
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,568
- And it's only when you're here?
- Yes.

217
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,605
When I leave, maybe 5 minutes, I'm good.

218
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,742
I'm really scared

219
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:32,345
that it's gonna try and
make me take my life.

220
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,452
Okay. So somebody in here is possessed.

221
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:42,322
What is he making them do exactly?

222
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:43,690
He's making them bad.

223
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,560
They're, you know,
turning into a bad person.

224
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,696
Boy.

225
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,965
Okay, it's bad in here, you know?

226
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,969
You've just got the bad
guy coming and going,

227
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,804
coming and going, coming and going.

228
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,073
How would he affect
the person in this room?

229
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,542
They would think they
were losing their minds,

230
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:08,982
feeling weird pains,
illnesses, um, feeling drained.

231
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,617
Do you know what he
wants from the living?

232
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,553
Yeah, you know, make them
kill everybody in, you know...

233
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,055
- In the house?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,990
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,858
That's his goal. That's what he wants.

236
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,627
Why? Why does he want them to die?

237
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,095
Because he's insane.

238
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:44,990
So, Tracy, I talked to Briana,

239
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:46,239
and, she's going through a lot.

240
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,538
She was telling me

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,874
how she's changed emotionally
while she's been here,

242
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,476
mood swings and stuff like that.

243
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,610
Have you noticed that?

244
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,112
Yes. I've noticed mood swings with her.

245
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,214
So what about yourself?

246
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,602
Have you had your
own experiences here?

247
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:57,949
Yes.

248
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,417
Okay. Tell me about what's going on.

249
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,916
We were sleeping in
the middle of the night.

250
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:04,316
And I was awakened by the door opening.

251
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,049
And it startled me so much

252
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,993
to where I had retrieved my handgun

253
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,993
to see who was coming in the house.

254
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,828
There was no one in the house.

255
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,830
Is it possible that the
door slammed out here

256
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,398
at one of your neighbor's houses?

257
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,168
Well, it's a different sound.

258
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,903
Windows open that night?

259
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,438
No windows open.

260
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,239
Okay. So anything else?

261
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,875
One weekend, as soon
as I opened the door,

262
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,011
it just hit us right in the face.

263
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,046
It was a horrible smell.

264
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:35,717
It smelled like a rotting
carcass, roadkill.

265
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,186
- Really?
- Yes.

266
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,921
You never found any
remains of any animal

267
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,489
that was dead or anything like that?

268
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,324
Nope, no remains.

269
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,893
Even under the house, there was nothing.

270
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:48,530
Now, Briana told me about
a physical reaction she gets

271
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,965
when she's upstairs.

272
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,401
To me, it sounds like anxiety.

273
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,003
Do you get any kind
of feeling like that?

274
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:54,403
Yes.

275
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,005
I can't fall asleep and get good sleep.

276
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,441
I'm always anxious and nervous.

277
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,509
Okay.

278
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,214
This creepy guy smells
like rotting dead things,

279
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,783
and it can make the living feel sick.

280
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,351
They're always nauseous.

281
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,186
I don't think anybody sleeps here.

282
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,222
I think it would be **** impossible.

283
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,526
It's too **** loud.

284
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:23,298
And because of this, I
would say that the people

285
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,238
become very, um, angry...

286
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,174
short, um...

287
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:35,344
argumentative.

288
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:38,046
I, like... I'm literally
getting, like...

289
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,581
Like, "Shut up."

290
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,618
God. There's too much. Stop it.

291
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,959
So, Kim, I understand

292
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:52,995
you're really good
friends with the family.

293
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,329
Right.

294
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,398
Briana seems to think
that her mom's suicide

295
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,566
had something to do with

296
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,601
the activity that's
going on in this house.

297
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,136
- Do you agree with that?
- Yes.

298
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,404
Okay. Why?

299
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,239
She always was really sweet and nice,

300
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,507
and she just seemed like...

301
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,776
All of a sudden, she seemed real evil.

302
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:08,911
I can't say for sure,

303
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,712
but she could have been demon possessed

304
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,147
the way she was acting.

305
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,417
Like, I got cold chills right
now just thinking about it.

306
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,286
So what about yourself? Any experiences?

307
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,820
I was by the steps.

308
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,122
Okay.

309
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:22,190
And all of a sudden, just
felt like some kind of force,

310
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,093
like, almost pushed me down the steps.

311
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:27,162
So how hard did you get pushed?

312
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,864
Just push me so I can
get an idea what you...

313
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,832
It was kind of like this,
and it was like... like that.

314
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,768
Okay. So you went off balance.

315
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,136
Right.

316
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,905
All right, so enough where
it could have broke your neck.

317
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,173
Right.

318
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,409
It scared me so bad I didn't
want to ever come back.

319
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,110
And I just feel like it's still here.

320
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:45,714
Now, do you think Tracy
and Briana are in danger?

321
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:46,651
Yes, I do.

322
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,850
I think there's something evil in here.

323
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,086
I'm afraid, if we don't do something,

324
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:52,487
that they could be hurt.

325
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,159
Okay.

326
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,027
We've got a lot going on up here.

327
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,800
It's the bad guy.

328
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,802
He's blocking the **** out of me.

329
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,809
He, has been trying to, jump me

330
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,144
'cause he wants to
control me and stop me.

331
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:19,248
This man is hanging upside down.

332
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,518
He's, like, glued to the ceiling

333
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,854
on his hands and knees.

334
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:29,791
And he's, like, making
his, like, mouth open,

335
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,394
you know, and his tongue
is, like, hanging out.

336
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,964
He wants everybody, you know, to die.

337
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:51,645
So, I haven't even started
my investigation yet,

338
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:55,047
and I know about three deaths
on my client's property...

339
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,448
Briana's mom's suicide,

340
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,749
her dad's weird accident,

341
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,152
and the renter who died
right on the property.

342
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:02,921
Now, I managed to track
down that woman's daughter,

343
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,357
and she thinks there's
something suspicious

344
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,625
about her mom's death.

345
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:12,831
Savannah, I want to
thank you for meeting me.

346
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,967
I know this is a tough
thing to talk about.

347
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,569
So, before we even get to what happened,

348
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,205
what could you tell
me about your mother?

349
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,340
She's a beautiful lady.

350
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,041
I actually have a picture of her.

351
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,644
- She was pretty. Wow.
- Yes.

352
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:27,846
Everybody remembered her.

353
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:30,282
If it wasn't her name,
it was her personality.

354
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,117
And your mom's name was...

355
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,552
Laquada.

356
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:35,387
All right, but she wound up living

357
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:37,856
in my client's house at some point?

358
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:42,427
Yes, in July 2012, and passed June 2013.

359
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,962
All right. So what happened?

360
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:46,899
She did gain a good amount of weight,

361
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,801
um, within a year, about 70 pounds.

362
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,870
- Seventy pounds in one year?
- Yeah.

363
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,839
Did she fluctuate in weight before?

364
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:56,708
Nope. She was always 120 pounds.

365
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,944
Now, I know you did
some digging into this

366
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:00,913
because you were a little suspicious

367
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,481
about the circumstances of her death.

368
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,783
Yes. I did manage to get

369
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,785
a medical examiner's death certificate.

370
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:08,287
Okay.

371
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:14,226
Okay. So Mom was 54 when she died.

372
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:15,594
Okay.

373
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:18,830
And here is the autopsy
report I was sent.

374
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,306
So, sweetie, she's got an
awful lot of medication in her.

375
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,340
Yes.

376
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,808
What was the reason for all that?

377
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,945
She was in a very serious
car accident in 1997.

378
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,179
Okay.

379
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,380
Well, this is strange.

380
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,516
The contributing factors
leading to her death

381
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:38,817
were undetermined?

382
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,486
I don't know.
Something just isn't right.

383
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:42,888
Did something fail on her?

384
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,524
Did she have a massive heart attack?

385
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:49,661
What would all of a sudden just
cause a decently healthy woman

386
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,230
to just not wake up the next day?

387
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:53,298
It hurts.

388
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:58,236
I can imagine it would hurt.

389
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:00,939
Nothing worse than not knowing

390
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:03,709
what the hell the answer is.

391
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:09,915
I feel that something just isn't right.

392
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:14,686
And I have no closure,
no answers, no reasons.

393
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,254
You don't think it's a suicide?

394
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,522
I don't.

395
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:18,957
So let me ask you.

396
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,626
Do you think the house

397
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,527
might have had something
to do with your mom's death?

398
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,596
Yes.

399
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,539
I'm seeing, like, a dead lady,
probably in her mid to late 40s.

400
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:38,944
And she's short, white, plump.

401
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:41,647
And she's got bleached blond hair.

402
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,415
You know, she curls it.

403
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,117
She's wearing, like,

404
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,519
a sweatshirt and jeans and tennis shoes.

405
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,056
So she's recent, you
know, like, by her clothes.

406
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,325
And she's blaming the house.

407
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:57,162
She said, "The house, the house.
I know the house killed me."

408
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:09,307
I feel fear, a lot of fear.

409
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,345
It's almost like somebody
got their head cracked open.

410
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:15,647
Like, it feels like that to me.

411
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,684
This is very, very bad, very, very bad.

412
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:21,720
My God.

413
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:23,889
I don't know what the
**** is going on here.

414
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:30,028
Like, it's, like, a vise
grip on my **** head here.

415
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:34,566
So far, I've
got three tragic deaths

416
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,635
associated with Briana's property,

417
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:40,372
two of them her own parents.

418
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:42,441
But I need to see if
there's anything else

419
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:44,142
that could help my investigation.

420
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:45,911
Searching through old records,

421
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,380
I see the previous owners, the Shipmans,

422
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:51,183
lost not one but two of their children

423
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:53,285
right on my client's property.

424
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,220
So I'm on my way to
meet with a genealogist

425
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:57,089
who looked into the
Shipman family for me.

426
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:58,857
She says she's got information

427
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,059
that will definitely help my case.

428
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,933
So, Edith, you mentioned on the phone

429
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,768
the Shipman family
had a pretty tough time

430
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,703
on my client's property
when they were there.

431
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,171
When exactly did they get there?

432
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,474
They bought the property in 1952.

433
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:17,809
They held on to it till 1994.

434
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:20,078
Okay. So who exactly moved in?

435
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,149
Well, Clarence, his wife,
Elsie, and their son, Sherwood.

436
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:26,718
What were you able to find
out about Clarence himself?

437
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,587
Well, here's a picture of him.

438
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:32,224
He did farm those 13 acres
that he was living on,

439
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:34,092
and he was also a cook
in a local restaurant.

440
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,093
Okay.

441
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,661
I know they lost a couple of kids

442
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,096
while they were living on the property.

443
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,331
Who was the first?

444
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,234
So I have the death certificate
here of Martha Verda,

445
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:45,170
who was the first
child to die at age 44.

446
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:46,938
She died of cancer.

447
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,374
The second child to
die young was Sherwood.

448
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:52,244
He died of a sudden heart
attack at 59 years old.

449
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,846
Now, when he died,
he was pretty wealthy.

450
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:57,215
He had several successful businesses.

451
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:59,618
Okay. So what happened with Clarence?

452
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,720
Here's the death
certificate for Clarence.

453
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,088
He died of a heart ailment,

454
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,723
and he might have been ill for some time

455
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,857
leading up to that.

456
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,893
Okay.

457
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:10,095
Well, I appreciate you really
looking into this for me.

458
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,997
You know, there's something else I found

459
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,732
when I was looking into this family.

460
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:16,234
One of the most gruesome
murders in Henderson County

461
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,637
occurred in the '60s,

462
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,438
and one of the victims was a Shipman.

463
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,446
Heart attack, heart attack.

464
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:34,820
Somebody died here from a heart attack

465
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:37,556
or at the hospital, whatever,

466
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,525
but they had a ****
heart attack here.

467
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:43,328
I wonder if it happened in
the house or right outside.

468
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,664
He's old. I know that. He's **** old.

469
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,668
And then this dead lady,

470
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,736
the one who says the house killed her,

471
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,638
she points to the little dead man.

472
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,775
And she says, "And I'm pretty
sure that it killed him, too."

473
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:59,244
Yeah. This place is very bad.

474
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:01,079
****

475
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,919
If you need us to investigate

476
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,621
unexplained activity in your home,

477
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:12,557
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

478
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,359
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

479
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:15,393
and we'll help if we can.

480
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,108
So Edith's tip checked out.

481
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,444
Turns out, there was a
triple homicide back in 1966.

482
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,047
And one of the victims was
a relative of the Shipmans.

483
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,617
I'm on my way to meet
with a local crime reporter

484
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,986
who says the case remains
unsolved to this day.

485
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,093
So, Emily, thanks for
looking into this case for me.

486
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,562
I appreciate that.

487
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,931
Let's start from the beginning.
The victims, who were they?

488
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:52,968
The first victim was
62-year-old Louise Shumate.

489
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,436
What do we know about her?

490
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,572
She lived in a town a few miles away

491
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,906
and worked at a music company.

492
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:01,009
She was kind of a mystery
for the investigators

493
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,045
in connection to the other two.

494
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,212
Okay.

495
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:06,448
The second victim was Vernon Shipman.

496
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,150
So this is the guy

497
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,018
that's related to the people
that owned my client's property.

498
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,187
Yes. He was 43.

499
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,056
He owned the Tempo Music Store,

500
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:16,658
which is just a couple
of doors down from here.

501
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,759
All right.

502
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,995
He actually had a romantic relationship

503
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:23,498
with the third victim,
36-year-old Charles Glass.

504
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,502
Glass was the manager
of Tempo Music Store.

505
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,305
So what do you know
about this guy, Glass?

506
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:32,774
He kind of lived a flamboyant life.

507
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:36,545
He didn't seem to care too
much about public opinion.

508
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:40,649
He wrote a book on voodoo or a magazine.

509
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:41,950
On voodoo?

510
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:43,619
On voodoo. Really?

511
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,220
This could be interesting for the case.

512
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,295
I'm seeing the revenge guy.

513
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:54,730
He was murdered.

514
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,733
Any idea when this was?

515
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:01,036
I'm getting like '40s, '50s.

516
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,571
Okay.

517
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,040
This vengeful guy who gets
people to kill themselves

518
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,308
is showing me how he died,

519
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,010
and it's beyond brutal.

520
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:09,778
He was on his way home from work.

521
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,914
To me, it seems like he was attacked.

522
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,452
Seems like there's multiple people,

523
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,254
at least four people.

524
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:22,224
It's nighttime. He's scared.

525
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,792
He's scared.

526
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:27,396
They kill him. They kill him.

527
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,133
And, and they, like,
leave him there to rot.

528
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,169
And now he's taking revenge.

529
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:39,074
The bodies were found July 22, 1966.

530
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:42,010
They were discovered in a grassy
field near a body of water.

531
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:45,180
They were found laying
in this semicircle,

532
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,948
and they were all facing up

533
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,850
and they all had
objects on their bodies.

534
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:50,519
Really?

535
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,554
You know, I've seen
cases like this before,

536
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:54,589
where bodies will be
displayed in a certain manner.

537
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,591
A lot of times, it's a sociopath

538
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,860
that's just trying to send a message.

539
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,662
I think, the way they were found,

540
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:03,331
a lot of people thought it
was ritualistic in nature.

541
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,766
Interesting.

542
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,536
So, what is the official
cause of death of each victim?

543
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:10,272
Well, according to
the death certificates,

544
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,841
they each suffered
fatal blows to the head.

545
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:15,477
Fractured skull, fractured skull.

546
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:18,780
Was anybody ever arrested and charged?

547
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,615
There were several suspects,

548
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:24,653
but no official arrests were ever made.

549
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,689
50 years later, it remains unsolved.

550
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:29,591
Okay.

551
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:34,496
Every time I walk inside,
the creepy guy flips out.

552
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:36,832
He's trying to jump
me and get me to leave.

553
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,434
He's making my head hurt really bad.

554
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:41,803
Yeah. He's pissed now.

555
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:43,371
He's not happy.

556
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:46,174
He doesn't want me to
know anything about him,

557
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:48,944
and he's doing everything
he can to screw with my head.

558
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:50,679
He ain't giving me ****

559
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,248
All I know is, he liked opera.
He liked classical music.

560
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,883
He was wealthy. He liked theater.

561
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:57,052
He liked literature.

562
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:00,122
Are you okay?

563
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:05,026
He was definitely in a mental
institution that's nearby.

564
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:07,329
He's very upset about this.

565
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,531
He was deranged his entire life.

566
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:20,709
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

567
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:24,312
so I'm meeting with a sketch
artist to describe two of them.

568
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,681
First, the woman who
said the house killed her.

569
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:31,853
She was probably in
her early to mid 40s.

570
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:35,757
Her face was pretty roundish,

571
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,126
definitely had some
lines around her mouth.

572
00:26:40,697 --> 00:26:42,631
Next, I describe the creepy man

573
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:45,901
trying to possess someone
in the bedroom downstairs.

574
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:51,840
There was this black fuzz coming up,

575
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,809
onto the bed.

576
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:58,013
And it's surrounding the person
that's closest to the window,

577
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,981
engulfing them.

578
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,490
Is this what you saw?

579
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,892
Yes.

580
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:33,026
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

581
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,595
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

582
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:38,731
and our clients for the first time.

583
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,969
So, Amy, I want you meet Briana,
and this is her fiancé, Tracy.

584
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,604
I don't want to give away too much,

585
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,873
but this poor kid's been
through hell in this house.

586
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,309
As the night goes on,
you're gonna see why

587
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:52,345
she so desperately wants
to hold on to this house.

588
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,347
The trouble is, she
thinks that whatever's here

589
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,416
is after her and that she's in danger.

590
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:59,953
Now that Amy knows just a
little bit about you guys,

591
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:02,455
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

592
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,661
There was a lot of stuff going on.

593
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:10,230
Right away, I got something

594
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,232
about people losing their faith here.

595
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:14,868
Then, I went to the backyard.

596
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,605
And a woman came forward

597
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:22,008
and said that she believed
that this house had killed her.

598
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,879
She was pretty short.

599
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:29,582
She was, like, I want
to say pleasantly plump.

600
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,619
She had bleached blond hair.

601
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:35,555
You might be onto something here,

602
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:38,825
but I don't want to
jump the gun just yet.

603
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:40,894
Did you get anything
else from this woman?

604
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:43,830
Not really. It was a
very short exchange.

605
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:47,534
But I did have a sketch done of her.

606
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,408
It's a really damn good sketch.

607
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:01,414
Look like anybody to you?

608
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:04,784
Yeah. But the hair's
throwing me off a little bit.

609
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,386
I don't know if you noticed,

610
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,988
but one of the bedrooms
upstairs has no furniture in it.

611
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,456
It's, like, hardly anything in it.

612
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,524
Yeah.

613
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:14,894
In 2012, a renter moved into that room.

614
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:17,830
Her name was Laquada Cantellops.

615
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:19,666
Now, in June of 2013,

616
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:22,001
she wound up dying
in her sleep upstairs.

617
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:25,772
Interesting.

618
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:27,840
I have her death certificate.

619
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:31,377
Now, to this day, there's still
no official cause of death.

620
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,012
It's still undetermined.

621
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,615
Now, when I spoke with
Laquada's daughter,

622
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,750
she gave me a picture of her mom.

623
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:39,619
And when I show you the picture,

624
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:43,489
you're gonna know why
that sketch blew my mind.

625
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
This is Laquada right here.

626
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,699
Does this look like the
person you might've seen?

627
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,501
Yeah. It looks very much like her.

628
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,438
The resemblance is uncanny.

629
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:04,744
I went into the backyard.

630
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,779
I got that somebody killed themselves.

631
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:11,250
I didn't get much
information on who it was,

632
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:15,221
but I did feel, um, some
very horrible neck pain.

633
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:20,159
And the person who did this

634
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:24,664
was influenced by a deceased male.

635
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:29,569
And what he does is,
he actually goes around,

636
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:34,007
and he will draw the
depression out of someone

637
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,144
to the point where they
will then kill themselves.

638
00:30:39,614 --> 00:30:45,451
Mom committed suicide on the
back porch with a shotgun.

639
00:30:47,255 --> 00:30:50,923
Um, it was unexpected.

640
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:54,327
Nothing was left...
no note, no nothing.

641
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:58,598
I've always thought
something pushed her to do it.

642
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:02,468
I got a photo of her mom.

643
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:10,810
I did manage to track
down the death certificate.

644
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:14,047
All right, so this is the
official cause of death.

645
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:15,848
That's probably where
the pain's coming in.

646
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,116
Yeah.

647
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,218
Tell Amy how, the last
couple of weeks, though,

648
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,353
she did change.

649
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:24,157
Her attitude changed, more worried.

650
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,093
She wasn't the type of
person to stand up to anyone.

651
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,461
Okay.

652
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:29,862
And over the past couple weeks before,

653
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,164
she started standing up to people.

654
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:37,203
So now, this dead guy
you're talking about

655
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,272
that influences people
to kill themselves,

656
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,307
how's he do that?

657
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,377
I saw him crawling
out of a body of water.

658
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:46,612
And he does not look good.

659
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,081
And what he does is,

660
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:51,017
he gets vulnerable
people to do things...

661
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,619
things like shoot themselves,
cut themselves, take pills,

662
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:57,690
turn the car on, anything
to get the job done.

663
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:59,992
Okay, so you think that this dead guy

664
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:02,428
influenced Briana's mom to kill herself?

665
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,964
Yes.

666
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,568
Now, Briana's lost her father, too.

667
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,538
I got a photo that Briana had given me

668
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,640
of her and her dad.

669
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,745
Tell Amy what happened to your dad.

670
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,847
He was working on his truck one day

671
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,783
at one of his friends' homes.

672
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:26,919
And the truck had flipped
over on its side...

673
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:31,924
no skid marks, no witnesses, no nothing.

674
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:35,495
The cops couldn't
tell us why he wrecked.

675
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,663
This is why Briana's so determined
to hold on to this house.

676
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,733
This is the last of her
connection to her parents.

677
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:45,972
I just want to stay where my family was.

678
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:50,409
It means so much to me to be
able to stay in this house.

679
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:53,713
I recognize that I'm
pretty much the only family,

680
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:56,015
the only support group she has left.

681
00:32:57,752 --> 00:33:00,620
So whatever we need
to do to keep her safe,

682
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:01,854
it's exactly what we're gonna do.

683
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,027
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

684
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,898
Yeah. I think that he
died fairly recently.

685
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,200
I got the '40s or the '50s.

686
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,368
He died at night,

687
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,804
and he was on his way home from work.

688
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:21,908
I got that he was attacked
by at least four people.

689
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,376
He was terrified.

690
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,078
They killed him somewhere else,

691
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,147
and then they threw him in the water

692
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,283
to get rid of him.

693
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:33,619
So he was murdered violently.

694
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:35,721
Now he just is very angry

695
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,991
and just functioning off of one thing,

696
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,960
and that is revenge.

697
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,361
That terrifies me.

698
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:45,932
There's a couple of
things that you were saying

699
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,100
that remind me of a triple homicide

700
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:50,036
that occurred in town in 1966.

701
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:51,838
Now, the police theorize

702
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,041
that the victims were
murdered in one place

703
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:56,642
and then left near a lake.

704
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,845
One of the victims of
that triple homicide

705
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,379
was this guy, Vernon Shipman.

706
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,181
He was a
43-year-old male.

707
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:03,816
He was actually related

708
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:06,052
to one of the original
owners of the property here.

709
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:09,355
The second victim was
this guy, Charles Glass,

710
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:10,790
who was 36 at the time.

711
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,192
Now, Charles was his lover.

712
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:16,829
Now, thing about Glass,
which was interesting,

713
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:19,665
is that he wrote about voodoo.

714
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,400
What?

715
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:24,971
He self-published a book

716
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:28,074
about tales of voodoo and black magic.

717
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:31,244
Now, there was a third victim,

718
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:35,314
who was a 62-year-old
female named Louise Shumate.

719
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:38,084
Now, I got death certificates for them.

720
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:41,487
All three were basically
bludgeoned to death in the head.

721
00:34:43,324 --> 00:34:45,391
Now, this happened almost 50 years ago,

722
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:47,360
and it's still unsolved to this day.

723
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:53,299
So the thing that interests
me here is the voodoo thing.

724
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:57,503
If he practiced the black
magic and the voodoo,

725
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,239
I would think it would be him.

726
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:02,341
Pretty mad if it's the one

727
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:05,211
that made my mom do what she did.

728
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:10,983
Anything else?

729
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,985
I met another person.

730
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,187
And this person seemed to me

731
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:19,926
to be a much larger,
direct threat as of now.

732
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,161
He was extremely tall, very creepy.

733
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,896
This person was extremely wealthy.

734
00:35:23,898 --> 00:35:25,865
He was very into music.

735
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:29,135
I got that he had been in
and out of mental institutions

736
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:30,269
when he was alive.

737
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:33,172
He is very unstable.

738
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,441
So the guy that you were describing,

739
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:37,910
when I pulled the deed for the property,

740
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:39,812
it was a 13-acre farm.

741
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:42,815
And it was just basically
hardworking people here

742
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,951
nobody that fits that description.

743
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:46,752
But when you mention music,

744
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:48,821
all three of the murder victims
worked in the music industry.

745
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:50,189
Okay. Interesting.

746
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,558
But I don't think this creepy guy

747
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,627
is connected to any of them.

748
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:59,332
The other thing with him is
that he smells really bad.

749
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:02,001
We'd been away for about a week.

750
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:05,638
When we came back up
and we opened the door,

751
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,807
and this awful, awful smell

752
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:09,709
just hit both of us right in the face.

753
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,644
It was terrible.

754
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:13,346
This **** what else does he do?

755
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:15,982
He can cause physical problems.

756
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:18,150
What I got was, like,
feeling physically sick,

757
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:22,388
being nauseous, and feeling drained.

758
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,957
He makes the living
feel like they're crazy.

759
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,126
He'll make you feel intense anxiety.

760
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,528
And people will feel manic.

761
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,131
And the reason why he's so dangerous

762
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,301
is because he can change
and influence people.

763
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:39,905
He can make people see good people

764
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,074
as being bad or evil.

765
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:45,478
I'll get really sick on my stomach,

766
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,513
and my energy's just gone.

767
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:51,817
And my head hurts all the time.

768
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:54,053
Do you guys ever get manic episodes?

769
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,521
Enraged, yes.

770
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:58,924
I'll be happy one minute,

771
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,727
pissed off at him for no reason,

772
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,329
and then depressed.

773
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:04,764
Well, you're, you know,

774
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,932
basically living with a sociopath.

775
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:14,740
So, when I was in the
downstairs bedroom,

776
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:18,544
I saw this black mist thing coming in,

777
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:21,580
dipping down onto the floor

778
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:24,683
and then coming up around the bed.

779
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:26,886
It was this sociopath.

780
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:29,221
He was influencing and affecting

781
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:32,191
and trying to possess this person.

782
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:34,393
I felt that it was a female

783
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:39,465
and that what he was attempting
to do or doing was a possession.

784
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:40,900
****

785
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:42,068
That was your mother's room.

786
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,969
She's the only person
that slept there, right?

787
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,271
Yes. All right.

788
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:48,941
So I had a sketch done of what I saw.

789
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,218
I'm sorry, honey.

790
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,619
I don't even want to
show you this, but...

791
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:07,626
I think this is probably what
was going on with your mom.

792
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:09,595
My God.

793
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,569
I'm really pissed off.

794
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:18,537
My mom didn't deserve that.

795
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,074
She didn't deserve to be picked on.

796
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:24,844
That's kind of the way
that I felt like she was

797
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:25,911
towards the end.

798
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:29,014
The life was being strangled out of her.

799
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,484
Do we think he's going after Briana now?

800
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:33,285
That's what I'm afraid of, yeah.

801
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,057
What he wanted to have happen

802
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:42,294
and what he would like to
eventually see happen here

803
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:46,265
is to cause the individual
to kill everyone in the house.

804
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,415
So, Briana, when we first met,

805
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:06,949
you had told me you thought
that your mother's suicide

806
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:08,358
had something to do with the paranormal.

807
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:11,059
- Yes.
- And it turns out, you were right.

808
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:14,663
Now we need to find out how
to kick these dead people out

809
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:16,197
so that you can honor your parents

810
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,499
and raise your family

811
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,267
here in the house that
you so badly want to be in.

812
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:22,601
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

813
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,487
It's my belief that your
mother was, unfortunately,

814
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:33,292
being influenced by two
very unsavory characters,

815
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:34,960
one being the dead guy

816
00:39:34,962 --> 00:39:38,063
that influences people
to kill themselves

817
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,499
and another being a dead male

818
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:44,836
who was trying to possess
her to harm others.

819
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:48,006
I think your mother, on some level,

820
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:50,976
knew that this was happening

821
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:54,012
and that, in fact, she
had a choice to make.

822
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:58,283
And she chose to take the option

823
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:01,587
that would not harm
anybody else but her.

824
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:04,189
Do you see what I'm saying?

825
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:05,791
- Yep.
- Yeah.

826
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:08,093
She would do anything to protect me.

827
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:12,130
What I would like to see happen

828
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:18,837
would be to have a priest come
and bless the property line.

829
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:22,307
And this is, you know,
going to keep him away.

830
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,843
All right. So what about
the **** inside the house?

831
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,913
The more intense thing

832
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:32,985
is to have a priest do
an exorcism of the house

833
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:35,787
to get rid of him.

834
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:38,624
It might get a little intense.

835
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:43,829
I also believe that the dead want you

836
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:49,901
to return to being more religious.

837
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:53,005
They feel like that's
something you need.

838
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:59,144
Up until now, I was mad
at God for taking my mom,

839
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,612
letting her do what she did.

840
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,047
If that will help...

841
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,921
...get this gone

842
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:13,625
and me to be strong enough
to get my faith back,

843
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:16,194
I will.

844
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:18,230
If these guys do what you told them,

845
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:21,400
could she start a family and live here?

846
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:22,668
I believe so, yeah.

847
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:25,704
As long as whatever it is is gone.

848
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:28,207
I mean, we're gonna do what
we can to get it out of here.

849
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,509
I'm ready to get this started

850
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:32,244
and get whatever it is gone.

851
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:36,048
If Briana and
Tracy follow my advice

852
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,583
and bring in a priest

853
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:40,219
to bless the property
and perform an exorcism,

854
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:42,588
they'll be able to safely raise a family

855
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,291
in the childhood home
Briana loves so much.
