1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,910
The living
don't stand a chance here.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,380
I feel like
we're being watched.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,850
- You do.
- Yes.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,350
I feel like he would
hunt me down and kill me.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,190
I had a couple cases
of beer.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,520
Right after I left the room,
they fell.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,530
There's also, like, a lot
of sex and bad --

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,930
it's so bad.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,230
A lot of times,

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,430
these women would get
black market abortions.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,270
This man was a killer.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,000
I just hear death.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,270
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,010
God.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,180
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,340
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,550
Her face was all demonic.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,350
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,250
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,650
...and they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,620
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,320
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,220
Something happened.
Bam. Bam. Bam.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,390
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,930
I'm Steve Di Shiavi.

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,660
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

28
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,270
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,170
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,970
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,340
But Steve and I
never speak...

32
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,410
We never communicate
during an investigation...

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,680
...until the very end...

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,280
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,080
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,250
That's it.

37
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,150
...or time to get out.

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,520
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

39
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm in Paso Robles, California.

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,970
It's halfway between LA
and San Francisco.

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,980
I got a call
from a guy named Ron.

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,440
Now, he owns a historic bar
in town,

43
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,780
but activity's so bad employees
are quittin'

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,220
and regular customers
are staying away.

45
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,850
The last thing he wants to do
is shut the place down,

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,350
but if Amy and I can't help,

47
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,460
that's exactly what
he's gonna have to do.

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,800
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,830
of anything that might
influence her findings.

50
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,240
This is a large space with a lot
of artwork and signs

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,940
that need to be covered.

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,940
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

53
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,810
for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,950
Boy. I don't like this.

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,990
So there's a female.

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,060
I got...
really creeped out by her.

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,730
She's almost...

58
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,270
like, a<i> real</i> shadow person,

59
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,170
but she's a dead person.

60
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,570
After she died,
she plucked out her eyes

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,340
because she didn't wanna
see anymore.

62
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,880
She made her face just a skull

63
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,950
so that other dead people, like,

64
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,590
around here and around town

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,260
call her "The Reaper."

66
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,360
She definitely makes me
very uncomfortable.

67
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,260
She is very angry.
She's bent on revenge.

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,510
So, Ron, when we spoke
on the phone,

69
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,510
you sounded pretty upset

70
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,940
about the things
that are happening here.

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,280
I mean,
what the hell's going on?

72
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm hearing things
from my employees.

73
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,450
I'm hearing things
from my customers.

74
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,050
Something's happening.

75
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,350
I'm not sure what it is,

76
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,290
but whatever it is, I need
to get it taken care of

77
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,550
before somebody actually
does get hurt.

78
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,220
Okay. Tell me, what -- what are
things that are going on here?

79
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,560
Well, my customers and employees
are telling me

80
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,900
they're hearing noises,
they're seeing apparitions.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,970
Things are moving around,

82
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,540
and it's gettin'
physical, so...

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Sounds like this is
all happening to other people.

84
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,640
Actually, I have seen
a few things myself.

85
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,140
Okay. Like what?

86
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,410
One of them was,
I was --

87
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,550
I was standing
at the end of the bar

88
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,120
and just looking down
the bar,

89
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,250
and I saw this shot glass
go from here to here.

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,090
The second thing was
by my coffee machine over there,

91
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,490
I had a jar

92
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,630
that literally went over the top
of some wine glasses

93
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,160
and just went off
on the ground.

94
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,370
Was anybody around
to knock it over?

95
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,570
No.

96
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,670
Why don't you just
sell it and walk away?

97
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,910
Well, one reason
is because my mom

98
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,010
started this place
45 years ago,

99
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,110
and, you know, and I took it
over about 5 years ago,

100
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,580
and I wanna keep it going
for her.

101
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,850
There's also another reason.

102
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,580
It's kind of like a mainstay
in this town.

103
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,690
It's one of the oldest buildings
in Paso Robles.

104
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,020
There's a lot of weird things
happening around here.

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,390
I need some help.

106
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,060
I need to know what it is
and I need to get rid of it.

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,890
Okay.

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,000
It doesn't feel very right.

109
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,200
It doesn't feel right.

110
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,140
The shadow woman
is like a hunter.

111
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,580
Her voice sounds like...

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,410
death.

113
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,180
Like, if you hear it,
like, she's coming for you.

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,120
You get that cold down --
all the way down,

115
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,360
like, from the neck
and all the way down.

116
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,190
So she can get
physically violent here.

117
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,560
I know, too, she definitely
follows somebody

118
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,170
and has, tried to,

119
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,300
harm them, in their homes

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
on several occasions.

121
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,340
So why'd you bring me
in here?

122
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,150
Well, I've had many reports
of things happening in here.

123
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,420
Okay. Did you ever see
any of this stuff?

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,120
No, I never did, so I decided
I'd stick some cameras in here.

125
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,590
All right.
Did you catch anything?

126
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,420
I did.

127
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,400
I had a couple cases of beer
just went off the stack

128
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,670
right after I left the room,
and they fell.

129
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,400
We're in California. You sure
it wasn't an earthquake?

130
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,170
Yeah, I'm sure because if
it was an earthquake,

131
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,110
half of my storeroom
would've been on the floor.

132
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,880
And I can't figure out
how the hell this...

133
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,210
This could be dangerous.

134
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes. Yes.

135
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,210
Anything else going on
in this room?

136
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,950
I had an employee workin'
back here in the bar,

137
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,550
and she was looking
over in that corner.

138
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,290
There was about
an 8, 10-inch knife

139
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,990
laying on a tray,
and the knife just went...

140
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,760
Like that.

141
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,560
And it missed her by...

142
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,790
It could've been worse,

143
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,960
and we just lucked out
on that one, I think.

144
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,300
Yeah. She could've gotten
seriously hurt.

145
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,770
The shadow woman,
she's physically capable

146
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,170
of hurting people.

147
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,640
- How?
- She runs around with a knife.

148
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,740
Maybe they feel sharp pains
or something.

149
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,810
I don't know.

150
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,880
She also attacked people
in their throat area.

151
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,090
She's so creepy.
She's so **** creepy.

152
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,920
And she's, like,
really freaking the **** out.

153
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,330
She's hurtin' me.

154
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,400
Ay. She's hurtin' me.

155
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,710
So, Ron, what's the story
with the second floor here?

156
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,610
The history is it used
to be a brothel,

157
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,410
but I use it strictly now
for my customers

158
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,910
as a place to rest when they've
had too much to drink.

159
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,520
All right. So is anything
going on up here?

160
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,720
Some people have told me

161
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,320
about somebody was hanging
from the ceiling.

162
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,260
All right. So, how did they
describe this thing to you?

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,860
They told me that
they saw something hanging

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,690
or like they were holding on
to the ceiling.

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
And they -- they --
they described him

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
as like a mannequin
or like a person.

167
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,570
Okay. Anything else?

168
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,370
I had a couple
from down South.

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,140
When they came back down,
I noticed the lady was,

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,570
like, 5, 6 shades lighter.

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,670
And I was like,
"What the heck?"

172
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,910
I said, "What'd you guys do
up there?"

173
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,640
And the wife,

174
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,380
just out of nowhere, said,
"It grabbed my butt.

175
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,210
It grabbed my butt," and that's
all she could say, was,

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,980
"It grabbed my butt."

177
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,220
I have a camera
that's up here in the corner.

178
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,790
Well, I thought,
Okay, let me check and see

179
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,390
if it's in that camera,
and by golly, I found something.

180
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,590
I did keep the video
of that one.

181
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,800
Wow.
Something touched her

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,700
because you can tell by
her reaction that's not acting.

183
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,010
You know, most of the time,
I get photos,

184
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,180
and I look at them
with a...

185
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,550
You know, like, "Hey,
any photo can be doctored."

186
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,980
Right. Right.

187
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,880
But unless you got some tech guy
that can fix video like this,

188
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,950
this is some pretty compelling
evidence you got.

189
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,820
- Yes.
- If Amy suggested

190
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,660
that you should leave,
how would you take that?

191
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,920
It'd be pretty tough.

192
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,430
This has been in my family
for 45 years.

193
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,900
I don't wanna get rid of it,
and I will do whatever it takes.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,330
Okay.

195
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,640
The shadow woman,
she's also able to jump people,

196
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,580
living people
who are sensitives.

197
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,820
The shadow woman is up here.

198
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,520
She kind of goes in between

199
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,660
where the ceiling
and the walls meet,

200
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,260
and then she'll
spread herself out,

201
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,000
and she can put her face
and her arms down.

202
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,540
I feel like this is a very,
very, very bad thing.

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,740
Like, I feel panicked.

204
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,300
So, Kim,
I was talking to Ron.

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,570
He said you worked here,
but you recently left.

206
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,730
Yes, I did.
Okay. How long
did you work here?

207
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,170
Almost 7 years.

208
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,640
Why'd you leave?
I'm curious.

209
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,980
I think the paranormal activity
is becoming more, um,

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,850
direct, more violent.

211
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,220
For my safety,
I had to go.

212
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,750
So now Ron mentioned
to me about,

213
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,290
customers havin'
experiences up here.

214
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,120
Now have they told you
the same thing?

215
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,420
Yes, many, many times.

216
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,660
I have customers that refuse
to come back up here.

217
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,160
There are customers
that have been so scared

218
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,600
that they will not return
to the saloon.

219
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,640
Okay. So what have you seen
or experienced?

220
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,470
Anything that you can
tell me about?

221
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,740
Yes.
We have a vacuum upstairs

222
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,440
that was moving up here
in the hallway,

223
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,480
but the electrical cord
was wrapped all the way around.

224
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,350
It was moving freely,
as if somebody was vacuuming.

225
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,720
So you didn't see anybody
holding it.

226
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,090
There was nobody holding it.

227
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,890
There was nobody up here.

228
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,190
That scared me.

229
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,160
That convinced me.

230
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
Okay. Anything else?

231
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,360
There is a presence
that you feel

232
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,600
when you come into
this place.

233
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,730
You always feel
like you're being watched.

234
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,500
I won't stay up here.

235
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,800
By doing that,

236
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,940
I'm challenging or welcoming
something to happen to me.

237
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,140
Are you feeling
any of that now?

238
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,610
I feel like
we're being watched.

239
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,680
- You do?
- Yes.

240
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,980
There is an energy
in this building.

241
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,820
By coming up here,
I become a target.

242
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,690
Okay.

243
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,190
There's, like, somebody saying,
"I know you. You know me."

244
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,730
"I know you. You know me."
"I know you. You know me."

245
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,430
And this is a dead person.

246
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,630
He's like, "I know you.
We've met."

247
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah, I don't like him.
I don't like him.

248
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,100
There's something wrong.

249
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm feeling pain right here...

250
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,010
and right into my throat.

251
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,740
It feels like I'm being stabbed.

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,080
My leg -- I feel like
I'm being stabbed there.

253
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,680
Who is this person?
I don't know.

254
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,890
He's crazy, totally insane.

255
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,560
I don't like this.
I feel threatened.

256
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,960
I fe-- I don't feel safe at all
with this person.

257
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,660
He thinks, like, I'm -- like I'm
ratting on him or something.

258
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,570
I'm thinking that he can
probably do a lot of bad things,

259
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,870
like, really, really ****
bad things.

260
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,140
Like, I feel like -- like --
like he would

261
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,740
hunt me down and kill me.

262
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,710
He's totally crazy.

263
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,380
My God, like,
totally **** out there.

264
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,480
After meeting with Kim,
I started talking

265
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,890
to other employees and customers
of the Pine Street Saloon...

266
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,750
I witnessed,

267
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,760
for the first time
in my life,

268
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,720
a full apparition.

269
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,830
I even verbalized
to my friends,

270
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,060
"Are my eyes deceiving me
right now?"

271
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,060
...and everyone --
and I mean<i> everyone,</i>

272
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,530
had experiences to share.

273
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,130
All right.
So, you heard footsteps.

274
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,540
What else is going on?

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,300
Objects, you know,
being thrown.

276
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,010
That's a little strange.

277
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,370
Once I noticed
the activity here,

278
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,350
things started happening
at my own home as well.

279
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,980
With all the stories
I'm hearing,

280
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,880
I'm surprised
Ron's still in business.

281
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,120
The mirror up there
just, like, psh.

282
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,490
Like, if I would've been
sitting there,

283
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,920
my face would've
been cut up.

284
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,790
And I went, "What the hell?"

285
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,660
One night,
I was sitting on the bed

286
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,090
when I looked up and seen
somebody goin' into the room.

287
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,430
So what you saw
was an apparition?

288
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,630
Yes. He -- he was
a little creepy, you know?

289
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,300
I even looked away,
and when I looked back,

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,470
he was still looking at me.

291
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,770
There's something here.

292
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,440
There's definitely --
There's something here.

293
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,510
I feel like the man
knows everything.

294
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,950
He can, like, hurt you

295
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,890
and, like, control you,

296
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,220
and you can't escape from him.

297
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,560
You can't hide.

298
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,860
Like, he just owns you.

299
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,570
He can mess with your mind.

300
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,030
You feel like you need to run,
you need to get out of here.

301
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,140
You would feel frightened.

302
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,310
You would feel panicked,
scared.

303
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,080
He's gonna find you
and he's gonna get you.

304
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,820
He can manipulate them
and brainwash them.

305
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,490
People would have
nervous breakdowns.

306
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,890
They would be very sick.

307
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,390
They would have a lot
of physical attacks on them.

308
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Living don't stand
a chance here.

309
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,570
Just, they don't
**** stand a chance.

310
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,680
So the minute
I get to a location,

311
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,890
I reach out to journalists,
local cops, genealogists,

312
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,460
anybody that can help me
with my case.

313
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,430
I just got a call back
from a local reporter

314
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,490
who says the original owner
of the property

315
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,960
has a story so colorful
it should be made into a movie.

316
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,910
So, Peggy, I appreciate
you helping me with this.

317
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,070
But let me ask you.

318
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,340
Why'd you bring me
all the way up here?

319
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,810
Well, this is a winery now,
but this property

320
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,450
was actually owned originally
by the Blackburns

321
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,320
that had the property
that you are investigating.

322
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,290
It was two brothers,
James and Daniel.

323
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,020
When did they get here, and how
much property did they have?

324
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,530
1857, they bought 26,000 acres
of what became Paso Robles.

325
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,500
And they split it evenly
between the two of them,

326
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
13,000 acres each.

327
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
Daniel went ahead
and took the portion

328
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,370
that actually is now
the, um, Pine Street Saloon.

329
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,040
Okay. So what do we know
about him?

330
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,540
Daniel was kind of
the dominant brother.

331
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,380
He was a very ambitious man
and he was a clever man.

332
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,710
And to protect his property,

333
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,320
he had himself
appointed sheriff.

334
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,020
He actually even had a vigilante
group that he directed.

335
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,360
They had 200 deputies
that were charged primarily

336
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,630
with removing Native Americans
and Mexicans from the property.

337
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,960
And very sadly,

338
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,000
a lot of people were killed
by this vigilante group.

339
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,370
Now, Peggy, you said
this guy Daniel had

340
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,800
a pretty rough time with things
while he was here.

341
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,640
Yes, he did. He --

342
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,200
he had married a woman
named Cecelia Dunn,

343
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,710
and this is her later
in life, of course.

344
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,340
And they had three children.

345
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,210
And in 1871,

346
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,480
she was in a carriage
with the three children,

347
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,750
and something spooked
the horse,

348
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,050
and, their
1- year-old daughter Jenny

349
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,590
was thrown out
of the carriage.

350
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,120
A soapbox flew out
of the carriage

351
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,790
and struck her in the head...

352
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,390
and it killed her instantly.

353
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,760
- This was a 1-year-old?
- Yes.

354
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,630
That's pretty tragic,
especially the way it happened.

355
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,800
Yes.

356
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,960
All right, so, Peggy,
when did they get around

357
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,370
to building the saloon
I'm investigating?

358
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,300
They built it approximately
in the mid-1880s.

359
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,100
So what happened after that?

360
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,840
Around the mid-1890s,

361
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,210
Daniel Blackburn's health
started to fail,

362
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,050
and he passed away in 1901.

363
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,250
Even in his death,

364
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,680
there were legal problems
over the property.

365
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,390
- And what happened?
- Daniel's widow, Cecelia,

366
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,890
had been left
all the property,

367
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,820
but he didn't leave anything
to the two sons.

368
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,590
And, within a year or so,

369
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,190
the two sons turned around
and sued their own mother.

370
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,730
Now according
to this article,

371
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,970
Daniel Blackburn actually was
mentally incompetent.

372
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,300
That's what the court found.

373
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
They did win the lawsuit,

374
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,870
and that was the end
of the saga of the Blackburns.

375
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,720
The creepy guy
is really dangerous.

376
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,190
Like, he feels, like, ownership.

377
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,920
I was seeing...

378
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,760
something actually
about a horse accident,

379
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,900
and it killed the rider.

380
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,600
I feel like this man
was a killer.

381
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,570
There's victims around him.

382
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,910
There's victims.
Like, I feel like --

383
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,810
like this man is,
like, unhinged.

384
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,650
He can hurt you and, like,
control you.

385
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,820
It's so scary.

386
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,690
There's something
about a code of silence.

387
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,130
You can't hide.
You can't escape from him.

388
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,830
Like, he just owns you.

389
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,640
So Ron mentioned
the upstairs area of this hotel

390
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,210
used to be a brothel.

391
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,380
Turns out it's true.

392
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm on my way to meet
with a local crime writer

393
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,550
who says the conditions
were absolutely horrible.

394
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,990
So, Skye, thanks for
helping me out with the case.

395
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,190
I appreciate that.

396
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,690
We can assume then
that Ron's right

397
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,530
and upstairs might've been
a boarding house or a brothel.

398
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,270
Yes. It was kind of
widely known, um,

399
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,400
that a lot of the bars had
these sort of operations

400
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,570
that were happening upstairs.

401
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,340
Um, they were called
boarding houses.

402
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,610
That was the code word,
the kind of cover word.

403
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,440
They would operate above bars
like Pine Street.

404
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,950
Okay, so when would this
have been going on?

405
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,580
It started in, like,
the late 1800s,

406
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,320
and then into
the 21st century.

407
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,450
There was a real boom,
with the prostitution trade,

408
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,790
around World War I

409
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,920
because there was a large influx
of military personnel.

410
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,760
Now I did a lot of cases
with these brothels,

411
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,430
and I know the conditions
were horrible.

412
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,860
Did that happen here?

413
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,330
The conditions were terrible,
a lot of drugs and drinking.

414
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,540
And a lot of times,
they would abuse the women,

415
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,670
beat the women.

416
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,870
Then, of course,
it was not sanitary.

417
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,640
They didn't have access
to good medical care,

418
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,410
so a lot of times,
these women would get pregnant

419
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,480
and have to get
black market abortions.

420
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,320
There's these people,
they seem young.

421
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Like, I'm just seeing,
like, people on drugs,

422
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,360
strung out, partying.

423
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,530
Drugs, drugs, drugs. Okay.
I feel like I'm on drugs.

424
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,540
There's also, like,
a lot of sex going on,

425
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,170
like, a lot of sex.

426
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,370
It's, like, so thick and bad.

427
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,110
It's so bad.

428
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,880
They're bad people.

429
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,380
I don't like it.

430
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,350
I don't know how anybody
could, like, for 1 minute,

431
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,920
be up here and be okay.

432
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,890
All right, so these girls

433
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,260
that had to get
these illegal abortions,

434
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,920
was there a doctor
in town they went to?

435
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,130
Well, actually,
there was a gentleman named,

436
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,960
Christian Thomas
who was a bartender

437
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,230
who moonlighted as,
an illegal abortionist.

438
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,400
What?

439
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,470
So I actually have a photo
of Thomas.

440
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,010
That's him there.

441
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,010
He actually worked in a place
called Lyle's Cocktail Lounge

442
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,180
about 300 yards away
from Pine Street.

443
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,910
All right. So where'd this guy
do these abortions?

444
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,580
He would bring his clients
back to his apartment,

445
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,120
which was
right around the corner.

446
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,920
We actually have
a picture of it as well.

447
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,760
So that was the room where
he would do the procedures.

448
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,890
So this is where
these poor girls were going.

449
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,790
Do we have any idea
how many he performed?

450
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,160
He admitted to 12.

451
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,600
Okay, you said he admitted
to doing 12 abortions.

452
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,030
So what happened?
Did he get caught?

453
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,500
In, -
So September 1, 1953,

454
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,640
he had a client, um,
that he botched the procedure,

455
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,970
and she ended up dying.

456
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,410
Okay. So what do we know
about the victim?

457
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,910
Her name was
Virginia Grider.

458
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,710
This is a picture of her.
She was 30 years old.

459
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,580
She was actually
from San Francisco.

460
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,350
Does he go to jail?
What's the story?

461
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,120
Thomas was arrested,

462
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,990
and later found guilty
of second degree murder.

463
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,530
She's still out here.

464
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,930
Who?

465
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,600
The shadow woman.

466
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,830
No one helped her.

467
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,270
She feels like she was, like,
a younger person when she died.

468
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,010
But she's from the '20s or '30s.

469
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,380
And I did keep seeing a knife,

470
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,950
so I don't know
if she was stabbed by a knife.

471
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,080
She says, "I was not a whore,"

472
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,120
but I think she was murdered.

473
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,490
Very disturbing.

474
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,990
If you need us to investigate

475
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,900
unexplained activity
in your home,

476
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,770
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

477

to submit your story,

478
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,870
and we'll help if we can.

479
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,380
So far I know Ron's bar
was home to a brothel,

480
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,820
and his property used to be
owned by a ruthless sheriff

481
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,220
who was behind several
vigilante murders.

482
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,450
But I need to see
if there's anything more.

483
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,460
Searching through old records,

484
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,930
I find a man
named William Crawford.

485
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,890
Turns out, he was found dead

486
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,060
right outside
the Pine Street Saloon.

487
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm on my way
to meet with a local lieutenant

488
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,640
who says this case
was truly bizarre.

489
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,380
So what can you tell me
about William Crawford's case?

490
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,120
July 4, 1947,
he was dead on the doorstep,

491
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,950
on the back porch actually,
of -- of the hotel.

492
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,950
What were the circumstances?

493
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,320
Mr. Crawford was
a 60-year-old ranch hand

494
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,160
that was living
in an upstairs room,

495
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,930
and he'd been drinking
all night long.

496
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,760
So he was found
by some of the dishwashers

497
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,430
that were working at the hotel
the next morning.

498
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,730
They thought
he was passed out,

499
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,730
so they called the police
to come and investigate.

500
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,340
- Okay.
- So when they got there,

501
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,870
what they found was
that he was actually dead.

502
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,210
He died from an injury
to the back of his head.

503
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,080
All right, so what do we think
happened with this guy?

504
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,940
So we think he got
locked out of his room.

505
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,820
He was drunk the night before,
ended up on the back porch,

506
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,150
tried to climb up,

507
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,590
probably slipped off the ladder,
and injured himself.

508
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,990
They ultimately did the,
the coroner's investigation

509
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,120
that he had a,
fractured skull

510
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,490
on the back of his head,

511
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,230
and he died of
a brain hemorrhage.

512
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,380
Ew.

513
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Like, some guy,

514
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,250
like, rolling around
on the floor crawls up to me.

515
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,280
He thinks he's still alive.

516
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,020
Can you see who this is?

517
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,960
Did this guy jump you?

518
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,760
Yes...

519
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,830
I can't even think straight,

520
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,870
Like...so messed up my head.

521
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,340
I feel like...
I feel very confused.

522
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,980
I feel like I'm drunk.

523
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,710
I have this weird...

524
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,250
very weird taste in my mouth.

525
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,790
My teeth hurt.

526
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,960
Somebody broke their teeth.

527
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,890
My head, my head.

528
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,830
My neck hurts.
My neck hurts..

529
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,860
I see, like, blood on my hands.

530
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,070
I feel like I'm yelling
or screaming inside,

531
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,470
and then there's blood
everywhere.

532
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,470
Seems like he wants help.

533
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,410
Is he making you move
like that?

534
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,320
He can make you move,
like a doll.

535
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,790
Do you know if this is something
he does to others?

536
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,390
Yes.

537
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,860
Is this something that could be
dangerous to the living?

538
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,630
Yeah.

539
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,500
Like, you could have, like,
a heart attack, I think.

540
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,370
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

541
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,770
Okay.

542
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,870
Getting out of here.
I'm going now. I'm leaving.

543
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,580
I saw several dead people
during my walk,

544
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,650
but the shadow woman
who can jump people

545
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,880
concerns me the most.

546
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,760
She's spread out
over the entire...ceiling,

547
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,930
but her face
is just a skull.

548
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,360
Her arms are coming down,

549
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,500
and they're coming
for my throat.

550
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,540
Amy, is this what you saw?

551
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,240
Yes.

552
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,330
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

553
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,730
we're ready
to reveal our findings

554
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,300
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

555
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,140
So, Amy,
I want you to meet Ron.

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,310
He's owned this place
for the last 5 years.

557
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,610
The activity is so bad here

558
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,740
that he's having a hard time
keeping employees,

559
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,250
Kim being one of 'em.

560
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,480
She quit a few months ago

561
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,080
because she thought she was
in danger.

562
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,990
Ron doesn't even know if it's
safe for anybody to be here,

563
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,790
but he's determined to keep
the doors open for one reason --

564
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,960
his mom.

565
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,960
She ran this place for 40 years,

566
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,930
and Ron is not gonna let
the paranormal ruin her legacy.

567
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,230
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's happening here,

568
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

569
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,910
There's three deceased
individuals here

570
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,940
that I'm most concerned
about.

571
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,880
The first individual
was a woman

572
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,420
that I met
when I was out back.

573
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,990
And the thing
that unsettled me about her

574
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,060
was that she looks so much

575
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,930
like a real shadow person.

576
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,800
It was extremely unnerving
for me.

577
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,500
And after she died,
she said to me

578
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,170
that she didn't wanna see
anymore,

579
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,470
so she actually
plucked her eyes out,

580
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,470
and then her face
became a skull.

581
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,680
I- I do feel like she could
be dangerous, um,

582
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,480
to the living here.

583
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,950
She goes after necks,

584
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,790
like, grabbing people
and poking at their throats.

585
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,390
She's very disturbed.

586
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,460
She carries a-a knife
with her.

587
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,330
I think she wants
to kill people with the knife.

588
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,440
I had a experience with one
of my employees in my back bar.

589
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,940
She was looking over this way,

590
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,870
and the knife was
on the other side,

591
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,410
and then it just went
off the shelf.

592
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,650
And so she turns around
and looks and looks at it

593
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,520
for about a minute
and just takes off running.

594
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,580
- Wow.
- Yeah.

595
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,850
Now Ron here is a skeptic...

596
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,220
...because he doesn't have
many experiences

597
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,090
except for the couple things
he's seen.

598
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,030
But you got so many complaints
from customers and employees,

599
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,100
you decided to put in cameras.

600
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I gotta show you something
that's pretty compelling.

601
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,170
There's a backroom here
where they keep, um, stock.

602
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,040
There's Ron.

603
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,610
Wow.

604
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,840
I thought maybe
with the weight, you know,

605
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,250
top heavy
and all this other stuff,

606
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,110
but it wasn't.

607
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,350
My God.

608
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,420
So is this woman responsible
for all the stuff

609
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,920
that's moving around down here?

610
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,290
Yes.

611
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,890
So is it possible that
knife thing might've been her?

612
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,260
Yeah.
I would think if...Yeah.

613
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,830
I mean, she's all about
the knife, so...
Yeah.

614
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,270
I did have a sketch
done of her,

615
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,200
and it's from
the point of view of someone

616
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,210
seeing her hanging
from the ceiling.

617
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,410
What?

618
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,580
Hold on a second.

619
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,690
Wait till you see this.

620
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,890
- Wow.
- Wow.

621
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,300
Wow.

622
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Eyes are creepy.

623
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,270
About 4, 5 years ago,

624
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,940
rooms 2 and 3 had
two people in each room.

625
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,300
I asked them how their stay was,

626
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,670
and they said,
"Yeah, everything was great,

627
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,070
except we saw this mannequin
hanging from the ceiling."

628
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,440
****.

629
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,180
- Can I flip this?
- You can flip that.

630
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,880
It just creeps me out.

631
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,250
Yeah.

632
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,550
Any clue about her in life?

633
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,320
I got that she died young.

634
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,390
I think she died
in the '20s or '30s.

635
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,590
I wasn't certain
if she killed herself

636
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,630
or if she was murdered.

637
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,160
But I saw her holding
a knife,

638
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,830
so I think she might've
been killed with one.

639
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,370
She kept saying
that she's not a whore,

640
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,410
nobody cared about her,
nobody helped her,

641
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,640
and that she's angry
and she wants revenge.

642
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,940
So she's got a knife.

643
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,280
She died young and she told you,
"I'm not a whore."

644
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,450
Yeah.

645
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,180
I mean, this could be
a long shot.

646
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,490
There was a guy named
Christian "Tommy" Thomas,

647
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,990
who was a bartender

648
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,720
that performed illegal abortions
right here in town

649
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,690
from the '30s to the '50s.

650
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,560
Actually got a photo of him.
He's pretty...

651
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,130
- God.
- Ew.

652
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,300
- That's creepy.
- Really?

653
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,470
Now I got a photo here
of his apartment

654
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,070
where he actually did
these abortions.

655
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,380
As you can see, it's the most
unsanitary-looking place

656
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,510
you can find.
- My.

657
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,480
Now, of course, abortions
were illegal back then,

658
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,820
and he, um, was
the only game in town.

659
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,390
On September 1, 1953,
a woman named Virginia Grider

660
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,790
came to Paso Robles
looking for Thomas.

661
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,930
This is her.

662
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,330
She was from the Bay Area,

663
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,700
and her husband drove her
down here to do it.

664
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,700
But the abortion was botched...

665
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,500
and she died.

666
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,870
- Wow.
- Thomas was arrested.

667
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,240
He plead guilty.

668
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,540
He had a sentence of 5 years to
life, and he did 5 years.

669
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,380
Sad.

670
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,620
Okay, so what else?

671
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,320
I ended up in the attic,

672
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,630
and I had a very negative
experience up there with a male.

673
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,560
I didn't even understand
what was happening,

674
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,600
but he just got me good.

675
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,770
He jumped me, which means
he literally went into my body.

676
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,340
And I think that
he's extremely good at --

677
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,110
at doing this,
which makes me nervous

678
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,450
because I think that he could
affect living people.

679
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,320
He can make you move,
like a doll.

680
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,850
I can't even think straight.

681
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,860
Like...so messed up my head.

682
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,100
Somebody could have
a heart attack.

683
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,700
Any idea who this guy
might've been that jumped you?

684
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,870
What I was able to get

685
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,140
was that he is stuck
in his death state,

686
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,940
which might indicate

687
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,440
that he died suddenly.

688
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,450
I had incredible neck pain,

689
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,250
and then my mouth,
my teeth,

690
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,820
in particular,
felt very strange.

691
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,320
I felt drunk, confused.

692
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,760
There was blood everywhere,

693
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,590
and I know
that he wants help.

694
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,130
He wants out.

695
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,460
Now listen, a lot of people
have come through this place,

696
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,900
so it could be anybody.

697
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,740
But when you talk
about somebody dying suddenly,

698
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,800
teeth smashed in, drunk,
one person comes to mind.

699
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,110
Um, on July 4th, 1947,

700
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,910
there was
a 60-year-old farm hand

701
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,350
by the name of William Crawford
that was staying upstairs.

702
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,020
He was drinking at the bar.
He was hammered.

703
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,420
According to witnesses, left,

704
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,990
tries to get into his room,
he's locked out.

705
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,720
And at that time, there was
a ladder that went upstairs.

706
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,520
They surmised that he fell
trying to get into his room.

707
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,960
He had a fractured skull,
teeth caved in,

708
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,660
the whole nine yards.

709
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,100
Now does this sound
like the guy who jumped you?

710
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
- Yeah. I know it was him.
- Okay.

711
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,940
All right, what else?

712
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Okay, so...
on the second floor,

713
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,650
the residual energy up there
was so strong,

714
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,050
it was physically
making me sick.

715
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,350
Wow.

716
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,520
And I don't think that
living people would be able

717
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,920
to stay up there for very long
and feel comfortable.

718
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,530
I was seeing,

719
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,330
people, like, dancing,
singing, drinking,

720
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,660
doing drugs,

721
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,930
some people
being strung out.

722
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,640
Um, I saw a lot of,
sex happening.

723
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,970
Well, when I spoke with Ron,

724
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
he said that there might've
been a bordello

725
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,610
or a brothel upstairs.

726
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,510
So I checked it out,
and you were right.

727
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,680
- Really?
- Really?

728
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,280
- Yeah.
- It was a bordello?

729
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,220
From the 1800s all the way
up into the 1920s and '30s.

730
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,990
Girls were working here
and exposed to drugs,

731
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,320
alcohol, and violence.

732
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,590
- Right.
- You know...

733
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,230
Wow.

734
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,760
So the thing about
the second floor

735
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,070
was that I encountered
a male.

736
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,700
And then I felt, like,
this deep sadness,

737
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,670
and I felt that he was
experiencing a lot of loss.

738
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,910
And this upset him greatly.

739
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,350
I was seeing something actually
about a horse accident,

740
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,020
and it killed the rider.

741
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,180
I absolutely think

742
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,990
that this individual is
completely insane.

743
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,660
I felt that he had
killed people,

744
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,830
and/or had individuals
do this for him.

745
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,530
The thing about
this place

746
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,130
is that he feels
a sense of ownership.

747
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,170
Like, anywhere
this person's ever been,

748
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,640
he feels like he owns
that space and time.

749
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,070
So the guy says he feels
ownership of the place,

750
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,610
killed people,
and had mental problems.

751
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,810
Yeah.

752
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,550
Okay, there is somebody
that it could be.

753
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,110
Now his name
was Daniel Blackburn.

754
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,380
I got a photo of him.

755
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,690
Um...this is him right here.

756
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,260
Wow.

757
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,160
His eyes are
kind of creepy.

758
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,530
Now Daniel was
a wealthy investor

759
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,330
who owned 26,000 acres
of land here,

760
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,060
including your property.

761
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,300
You said the guy either killed
people or had them killed.

762
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,440
So when he came into town,

763
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,870
he formed a vigilante group
of about 200 men,

764
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,040
and he basically got rid
of all the Mexicans

765
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,480
and all the Native Americans
that were here...

766
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,750
And displaced them.

767
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,480
More than likely,
he just killed a lot of them.

768
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,610
Wow.

769
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,920
And you said he was upset
about a loss.

770
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,820
Blackburn's wife was
in a horse and carriage

771
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,620
with their 1-year-old
when the baby was

772
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,030
tossed out from the horse,
getting spooked,

773
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,030
and the baby died.

774
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,300
Now you said
he was mentally unwell.

775
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,700
Check out this article.
It's pretty interesting.

776
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,140
After his death,

777
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,770
courts decided that Blackburn
was mentally incompetent

778
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,040
at the end of his life,

779
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,040
and, he wasn't of sound mind
to make a will.

780
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,450
Now you're the only one that
got a look at him.

781
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,150
What do you think?

782
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,150
I'm not sure
if it's him or not.

783
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,620
The only thing is --
is the eyes.

784
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,820
Like, the eyes,

785
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,560
'cause he had light eyes
and he had thick brows.

786
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,130
His energy
was extremely terrifying.

787
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,870
I got that he was
a telepath.

788
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,400
Telepaths are able to,

789
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,510
really
heavily influence people.

790
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,010
You can't escape from him.

791
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,480
You can't hide.

792
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,550
He can mess with your mind.

793
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,380
You feel like you need to run,
you need to get out of here.

794
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,950
He's gonna find you
and he's gonna get you.

795
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,060
You do feel a sense of panic
and anxiety upstairs,

796
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,760
from all of
this negative energy.

797
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,090
Everybody said
they had the feeling

798
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,400
of being watched up there.
- Yes. Yes.

799
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,670
There are some people
who will not return up there.

800
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,000
A year, year and a half ago,

801
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,000
I had a couple from out of town
that wanted to see

802
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,840
the architecture
of the building upstairs.

803
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,070
And when they came back,

804
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,040
the next thing
the woman said was,

805
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,680
"It grabbed my butt," and that's
all she could say was,

806
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,350
"It grabbed my butt."

807
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,820
And I actually have it on video.

808
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,220
Wow.

809
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,750
Let me show Amy
what we're talking about.

810
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,050
So the husband's
just, like, you know,

811
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,460
I'm going in first, take a look.

812
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,520
He's not paying attention
to her.

813
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,630
And all of a sudden, bam.

814
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,900
- Wow.
- Yeah.

815
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,330
My concern would be
being influenced

816
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,540
over a long period of time.

817
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,570
You could have
nervous breakdowns,

818
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,340
get physically attacked.

819
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,040
Eventually, people could
get killed here.

820
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,950
Is there any place safe
in this building?

821
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,220
No. No, not right now.

822
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,020
Living don't stand a chance
here.

823
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,820
There's something pretty much
in every nook and cranny.

824
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,190
Wow.

825
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,890
Wow is right.

826
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,130
I didn't realize
there was that much going on.

827
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,460
I mean, I...

828
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,330
I love this bar.

829
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,870
There's something special
about this place

830
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,840
and everybody here.

831
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,640
I put my heart and soul
in this place, and -- and...

832
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,840
the...
****

833
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,760
So, Ron,
I know you were adamant

834
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,630
about keeping the doors open
to honor your mom

835
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,240
and all the hard work
she put into this place,

836
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,410
but after hearing what Amy said
about what's going on here,

837
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,610
you're lucky
nobody's gotten hurt.

838
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,740
But I know you wanna fight this,
so I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

839
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,980
to see if there's any way
you can make this place safe.

840
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,620
Let me start with the male
up in the attic, Mr. Crawford.

841
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,090
He wants help.

842
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,660
He wants help,
so you need a medium

843
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
who is going to move
Mr. Crawford on.

844
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,330
The female...Okay,
so I wanna give her a chance.

845
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,000
I wanna give her
a fair shot.

846
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,770
So on another day,
you have a female medium come,

847
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,640
work some issues out,
and then move on.

848
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,740
If she doesn't go,

849
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,110
then I want you to contact
a demonologist.

850
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,720
And what the demonologist
will do

851
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,160
is basically do
an exorcism.

852
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,060
Wow.

853
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,900
Also, you need
a Reiki master.

854
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,130
This is
very, very important.

855
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,000
This person would come
two times per month

856
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,940
for 6 months...
- Whoa.

857
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,370
...to remove
all of the residual energy

858
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,310
that has collected upstairs.

859
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,580
And that's...
Yeah, that's a beast.

860
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,120
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

861
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,150
So if the Reiki master comes in

862
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,290
and is able to get rid
of all that residual stuff...
Yes.

863
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,220
...the creepy guy
will go along with it.
Yes.

864
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,320
Yes.

865
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,630
It'll be<i> very</i> quiet here.

866
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,700
Yeah.
- Sorry.

867
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,630
No, it's okay.

868
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,130
You gotta be relieved.

869
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,470
Yes. Yes.

870
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,240
You gonna take Amy's advice?

871
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,140
- Yeah.
- Whatever it takes. Yes.

872
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,480
If they can
clear things up here,

873
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,980
would you come back to work?
- Yes.

874
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,710
I do it because I love it.

875
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,750
It's an honor to work here

876
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,790
and to serve
the people in here.

877
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,790
Ron has a lot of work to do
if he wants

878
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,930
to keep his employees and guests
out of harm's way,

879
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,730
but with the help of a medium
and a Reiki master,

880
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,160
the dead will move on,

881
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,570
and Ron will be able to keep
this restaurant in his family

882
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,300
for generations to come.
