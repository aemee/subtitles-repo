1
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,812
My head hurts<i> so</i> bad!

2
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,413
There was a female figure.

3
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,749
She was hitting me.

4
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,318
She does attacks in here.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,453
This is one of
the worst stories

6
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,321
I've ever heard
about a guy's life.

7
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:25,092
Get it away.
Get it away from me now.

8
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:28,028
I'm overwhelmed.
I need answers.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,565
This is my room.
Get the **** out.

10
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:34,701
He's a problem.
He's a problem.

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,904
I just hear death.

12
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,206
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,741
God.

14
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,810
He was like,
"I'm going to get you."

15
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:43,944
I see dead people.

16
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,179
Her face was all demonic.

17
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,981
I speak to dead people...

18
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,717
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

19
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,118
...and they speak to me.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,653
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

21
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,790
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,792
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

23
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:59,293
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:00,928
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,663
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

26
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,165
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

27
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,735
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,937
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,840
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

30
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,809
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:16,877
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,079
...until the very end.

33
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,680
Is this dead guy
doin' that to her?

34
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:21,849
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

35
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,584
That's it.

36
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,753
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:29,223
Somebody is gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

38
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:46,373
I'm out here in the small town
of St. Charles, Michigan.

39
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,477
It's about 45 minutes northwest
of Flint.

40
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,178
I got a frantic call
from a woman

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,415
who says she and her daughter
are under attack.

42
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,884
They're both scared
for their lives, and they said,

43
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,953
"If we don't get there fast,
somebody's gonna get hurt."

44
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,261
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

45
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:10,998
of anything that could influence
her findings.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,833
This home is filled
with family photos,

47
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,670
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

48
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:20,107
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,254
There's something about, like,

50
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:37,458
this male that lived here.

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,726
He had a family.

52
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:44,498
He has this strange idea

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,035
that him and his family
were cursed.

54
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:51,739
And he's saying that
because of the curse,

55
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,108
everybody died.

56
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,577
He's a problem.
He's a problem.

57
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,052
When we spoke on the phone,

58
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:09,757
the only word that can describe
how you sounded was pure panic.

59
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,825
Yeah.
It's like a pressure cooker.

60
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:14,929
Like, everything's falling to
a head And it's gonna explode.

61
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,664
I mean, that's how I feel
in the house.

62
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,299
Okay. So what's goin' on?

63
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,501
We hear banging and knocking,

64
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,670
screams, voices,

65
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,673
things being thrown,
and now physical attacks.

66
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:33,514
My daughter, Kaleigh,
has woken up with scratches.

67
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,816
Um, her health
is pretty bad.

68
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,840
- What's she dealin' with?
- Stomach migraines and a racing heart.

69
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,891
Okay.
How old is Kaleigh now?

70
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,392
-20.
-20.

71
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:47,529
And she won't
stay in here by herself.

72
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,732
Okay. Now who's
living here right now?

73
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:51,933
Me and my daughter.

74
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:54,068
My husband, he's overseas.

75
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,337
And he comes back
in 18 months.

76
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,705
What's he doin' over there?

77
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,874
Construction in Africa.

78
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,377
When exactly did you guys,
move in here?

79
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,545
2002.

80
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,613
When the activities start?

81
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,815
Immediately,
but it was small.

82
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,183
When did it get violent?

83
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,754
2013, after Mike's mom
passed away.

84
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,522
She had cancer.

85
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:17,058
We have her ashes.

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,259
Where? Here in the house?

87
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:20,862
- Yes. I...
- You're kiddin' me.

88
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,571
What can you tell me
about your mother-in-law?

89
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,940
Um, she was 65
when she died.

90
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:34,342
- Okay.
- Her name was Ruth.

91
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,078
And those are
some pictures of her.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,681
How was Mike's relationship
with his mom?
Bad.

93
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,416
- It was bad?
- It was bad.

94
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,851
She was
a very controlling woman.

95
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,927
You all right?

96
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:57,865
She brought men home
in front of Mike.

97
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,701
I know there was infidelity.

98
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:00,902
So let me get this
straight...

99
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,438
While Mike's mother
and father were married?

100
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,674
So how did he deal
with it?

101
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:09,444
From what I gather,
at the time that he was 16,

102
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:12,046
he quit talking for a year.

103
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,681
Quit talking to her
or just quit talking?

104
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,583
Quit talking.

105
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,118
This looks like
it upsets you.

106
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,353
It does.

107
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,722
Yeah.
Here, take those.

108
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:30,865
I don't think a child
should have to go through that.

109
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,939
When we got together,
she didn't like me.

110
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,973
Do you know why?

111
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,709
I was 26
when I ended up pregnant.

112
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:45,013
When we told her that I was
pregnant, she's like,

113
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:47,281
"Well, I thought you weren't
that type of girl."

114
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,285
She wasn't a nice lady.

115
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,361
So there's this dead lady.

116
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,466
She gives a creepy vibe.
I don't like her.

117
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:08,469
She's, like, young mentally.

118
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:09,971
She's a pretty girl.

119
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,639
She was disgraceful.

120
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:14,142
I think that she might have been
married a few times.

121
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:16,944
Something about babies.
I don't know.

122
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,413
And I don't even know
who the ****

123
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,248
she was with to have the babies.
Like, you know what I'm sayin'?

124
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,450
Like, these other men...

125
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:25,753
She's creeping me out.
She's creeping me out.

126
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,764
Okay, so why'd you bring
me into the kitchen?

127
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,132
One day,
I was doin' the dishes...
Okay.

128
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,301
...and a box of tea bags
came flyin' at me

129
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,970
and almost hit me,
landed behind my feet.

130
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,572
- A box like that?
- Yes.

131
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,741
Okay, so what you're tellin' me
is it was up here?

132
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:51,112
Yes. Laying flat, yes.

133
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:54,048
- All right, so...

134
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,684
Me flingin' it a little bit,
it only lands here.

135
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,019
- Yes.
- All right.

136
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,154
Well, you got a main road
out here. Trucks go by a lot.

137
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,556
I saw when I was comin' up.

138
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,624
Right, but that won't make
a box of tea bags fall off.

139
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,960
- Well, not to where you were.
- No.

140
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,196
Okay. Anything else
in the kitchen?

141
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:11,432
I always have the unnerving
feeling of being watched.

142
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,668
- You feelin' it right now?
- Yeah.

143
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,336
Where you feelin'
it's comin' from?

144
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:18,539
Like, right here,
like I'm in its space.

145
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,675
Interesting.

146
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,643
All right, anything else?

147
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,113
I hear a woman's voice
saying, "Where's Mike?"

148
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:27,615
- "Where's Mike?"
- "Where's Mike?"

149
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:29,450
All right.
The obvious question is,

150
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,519
did it sound like
your mother-in-law?

151
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,956
Yeah.

152
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,391
You got some strange
stuff goin' on.

153
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:38,593
- Yeah.
- You okay?

154
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:41,028
Yeah.

155
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,797
It's a lot.

156
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,637
The dead lady,

157
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,974
she's, like, um,
a creeper, man.

158
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,776
She gets creepy
up on the back of you.

159
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,044
So then your --
your hair goes up.

160
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,846
She just smothers everybody.

161
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,915
She just starts screaming
and being weird.

162
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:07,989
<i> What</i> the ****?

163
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,427
Really likes this room, a lot.

164
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,264
She -- she very much likes
the closets.

165
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:24,672
I saw her, like,
throwing shoes or something.

166
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,881
Okay, so what's goin' on
in here?

167
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:37,652
I've been wakin' up
with bruises,

168
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:41,088
I just started
noticing them, like fingers.

169
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,924
- Just recently?
- Yes.

170
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:44,258
Have you had
any blood work done

171
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,194
to see if you have
any immune system problems?

172
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,396
Nothing's wrong.

173
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,264
Okay.

174
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,533
So this seems like a pretty
terrifying room for you.

175
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:55,002
Yeah.
Um, this morning,

176
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,904
at 4:00 in the morning,
woke up,

177
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:59,774
and there was a female figure,
saw the outline.

178
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,843
She was hitting me.

179
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,111
Who'd the female
look like to you?

180
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,647
Short hair. I mean,
the outline was short hair.

181
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,082
Do you think
it's your mother-in-law?

182
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,984
Yeah.

183
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:12,486
But I don't wanna say
that it was her.

184
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:15,056
Why would she slap me?

185
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:17,024
- Well, she didn't like you.
- I know.

186
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:22,396
You okay? Okay.

187
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:26,767
To see something
coming at me to hit me...

188
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,403
I don't know
how to explain it.

189
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,305
What do you think's
goin' on here?

190
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,841
I think
I made somebody angry.

191
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,376
Why do you say that,
sweetie?

192
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,712
Possibly angry
because Mike's overseas,

193
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,314
and she didn't want him
to go.

194
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:41,682
And who are you gonna tell?

195
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,752
I mean, people are gonna
think I'm crazy.

196
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:47,221
I don't think you're crazy.

197
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,456
All right?

198
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,093
All right. It's okay.

199
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:57,131
Somebody yelling in here,
"Don't be a stupid ****!

200
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,034
Don't be a stupid ****!"

201
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:02,570
It seems like

202
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:05,673
she does attacks in here.

203
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,341
What does she do?

204
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:11,279
Very slowly opening the door...

205
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,613
then she'll rush.

206
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:21,889
I feel like the living people
feel her open, open, open, open

207
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:24,058
and then attacking.

208
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,927
It's really bad in here.

209
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,828
I guess this is her space.

210
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,331
Like, I think
she's claimed this room.

211
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,532
It's, like, direct.

212
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,801
"This is my room.
Get the **** out."

213
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,324
So, Kaleigh, I had

214
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,659
a pretty emotional,
discussion with your mom.

215
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,795
Are you worried about her?
- Yeah.

216
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,430
What about Dad bein' away?

217
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:03,764
I don't like that he's gone.

218
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:07,068
But, I mean,
it's also kind of nice

219
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,005
because we don't have
to walk on eggshells.

220
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,406
What do you mean by
"eggshells"?

221
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:16,310
He gets really mean
when he's in the basement.

222
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:19,981
But after he's up here
for a while, it's fine.

223
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,182
Interesting.

224
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,217
So, Kaleigh, when I was
talkin' to your mom,

225
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:26,354
she said the activity
picked up enormously

226
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:29,857
after your grandmother's ashes
came into the house.

227
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,392
So do you agree with mom

228
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:33,694
that she may be here
and haunting you guys?

229
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:37,298
Yeah.
She was just a mean old lady.

230
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,299
Okay.

231
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,135
She treated me like crap.

232
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:43,237
Okay. So I know you guys
are havin' experiences.

233
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,372
I wanna hear about yours.

234
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:47,908
I hear knocking
coming from the closet

235
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,910
that's connected
to my bedroom.

236
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:54,448
Like, you know, like,
almost like something's falling.

237
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,251
But there's nothing in there
that could have fallen.

238
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:00,187
That's strange.
Anything else?

239
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:03,324
Um, I sometimes wake up
with scratches on my face.

240
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,326
- On your face?
- Yes.

241
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:08,262
So the scratches,
how often do you get them?

242
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:10,698
Maybe
once every couple weeks.

243
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,934
Let me see your fingernails.

244
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,771
Well, it's not your nails.
What about the cats?

245
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,172
The cats
don't come in here.

246
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,841
So, Kaleigh, do you think
you and mom

247
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,777
are in danger in this house?

248
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,246
- I do.
- Okay.

249
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,917
There's, like, a child here.

250
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,688
He has on, like,
overalls, lederhosen.

251
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,792
And there's some relationship
between him

252
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:40,628
and the guy who thinks
he's cursed.

253
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,765
Some of the things
that he does...

254
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,901
It's terrible. It's terrible.

255
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,103
He touches people.

256
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:52,073
You know, he touches them.

257
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:55,476
What he does to other kids,
not good.

258
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:58,879
The thing with him
with other kids, he'll glom on.

259
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:00,448
Like, get in them
for a little bit,

260
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,316
just a short period.

261
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:05,252
How people would see the kids

262
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,955
being influenced
by this dead kid...

263
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,324
Yeah?
...Is that
they would see, like,

264
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:13,427
the living kid
being, like, spaced out

265
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:16,330
because they're absorbing
dead energy.

266
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,998
They could have
heart problems.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,201
And the more he does it
and the more the living kids

268
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,203
are exposed to him,
the worse...

269
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,404
You see what I'm sayin'?

270
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,573
It could be bad,
really, really bad.

271
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:36,350
Lord, what the ****?

272
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,954
Get it away.
Get it away from me now.

273
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:41,755
What just happened?

274
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:45,359
Something...impacted my head.

275
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,628
I was talking about the little
boy, and that happened.

276
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,266
My head hurts
so ****<i> bad.</i>

277
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,301
Ooh!

278
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,210
Even though
Mike's halfway across the world,

279
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,980
I need to know what he thinks
is goin' on at home.

280
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,149
So I've arranged a meeting
with him over the Internet

281
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:09,817
to see what he's got to say.

282
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,419
So, Mike, I understand you're
over in Africa, correct?

283
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,754
<i> -Yes.</i>
- Okay.

284
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,356
I'm gonna be blunt.
Are you -

285
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,124
Do you believe what your wife
and daughter are sayin'?

286
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,426
<i> I believe it</i>
<i> to a certain extent.</i>

287
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,462
Okay. Your wife thinks
when your --

288
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:23,764
your mom's remains
came into the house,

289
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:24,798
things changed then.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,700
Do you -- Does that make
any sense to you?

291
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:27,868
<i> It does.</i>

292
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,637
<i> And I'm beginning to wonder</i>

293
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,840
<i> if we need to do something</i>
<i> sooner than later.</i>

294
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:35,009
Okay. Talkin' to your wife,
she said that

295
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:37,478
you and your mom
had a difficult relationship.

296
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,347
<i> Yeah. It wasn't -- </i>
<i> it wasn't very pleasant.</i>

297
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:43,417
<i> You know, and she was always,</i>
<i>...you know,</i>

298
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,219
<i> trying to get</i>
<i> into everybody's business</i>

299
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:48,889
<i> and trying to tell them how</i>
<i> to live, and stuff like that.</i>

300
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,558
Okay.

301
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:59,033
The dead man who thinks
he's cursed likes it down here.

302
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,568
I think that people
get really sad --

303
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,736
really, really sad down here.

304
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:04,505
There's a living male here.

305
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,974
The male has issues,
big-time issues.

306
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:09,777
It's, like, emotional ****.
Like, emotional problems.

307
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,880
He comes and goes.
He comes and goes.

308
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:15,482
I mean, I don't think
he was A-okay to begin with.

309
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:16,483
You know what I mean?

310
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,352
So he was, like,
a really easy target

311
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,654
for this cursed dead guy.

312
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,922
And what does he do
to him?

313
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:26,660
He influences him to act angry.

314
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,933
Mike, have you had
any experiences in the house?

315
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,002
<i> I've, you know,</i>
<i> seen, like, shadows</i>

316
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,437
<i> out of the corner of my eye.</i>

317
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,772
<i> You know, I'd be</i>
<i> in my workout room,</i>

318
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:40,574
<i> and I got some big mirrors</i>
<i> down here.</i>

319
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:42,710
<i> And -- and it would seem</i>
<i> like I'd see it</i>

320
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:45,079
<i> out of the corner</i>
<i> of my eye in the mirror.</i>

321
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,281
So how often
were you seein' this?

322
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:49,917
<i> Maybe once every couple</i>
<i> of weeks or so.</i>

323
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,353
Okay. Anything else?

324
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:55,155
<i> I've had, like,</i>
<i> a-a breath or something,</i>

325
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:58,659
<i> like, on my neck when I was,</i>
<i> you know, on the treadmill.</i>

326
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,027
Okay.

327
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,830
Could you figure out if it came
from a vent or anything?

328
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:05,666
<i> There -- there's not</i>
<i> a vent, right there.</i>

329
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,434
All right. So I don't know
how much of a skeptic you can be

330
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,303
after experiencing
something like that.

331
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,704
<i> Right.</i>

332
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,977
The guy
who thinks he's cursed,

333
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:20,114
he feels like this is<i> his</i> hell.

334
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,348
But his main focus

335
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,751
is just to get these
living people out of here.

336
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:27,721
He pushes weird,
emotions on them.

337
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,324
They feel ashamed for no reason.

338
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,393
They feel guilt for no reason.

339
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:34,528
They feel sad for no reason.

340
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,464
How do you think
prolonged exposure to this guy

341
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:38,832
would affect the living?

342
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:44,004
I think that he would drive
the living male insane.

343
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,254
The second I get
to a town, I work the phones --

344
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:03,257
cops, historians,
local journalists.

345
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,825
I try to see if anyone has
a lead.

346
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,927
I just got a call back
from a genealogist

347
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,530
who says one of
the original owners of the land

348
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,565
has pretty amazing
and tragic story

349
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,167
I'm definitely gonna
wanna hear about.

350
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,342
You had mentioned
on the phone

351
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,710
one of the original owners
of the property

352
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,579
I'm investigating
had a pretty tragic time there.

353
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,614
But before we get to that,
who was this guy?

354
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:28,982
Well, John Baumler.

355
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:33,053
He came over from Germany,
immigrated in 1880.

356
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,755
He was 29 years old.

357
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:37,458
This is John Baumler's
immigration record.

358
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,393
He came with his wife Anna

359
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:42,596
and two children --
Leonard and Frederica.

360
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,465
Okay. It says here
he's a farmer.

361
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:47,301
He's a farmer.
Six days after they got here,

362
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:50,404
their 9-month-old daughter
dies.

363
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:53,974
And 8 days after that,
their son dies.

364
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,175
My god.

365
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:57,344
I managed to track down
the death records.

366
00:17:57,346 --> 00:18:00,147
And here they are,
the two children.

367
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,684
Do we know what
they died of?

368
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,852
No.

369
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:07,321
They may have contracted
something on the boat.

370
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:08,856
Okay, so at some point,

371
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,424
they make it to St. Charles
with no kids.

372
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,425
Correct.

373
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,426
Do they try to start
a family again?

374
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,495
Yes.
They had two more children.

375
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:17,498
And then tragedy strikes again
for John Baumler.

376
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,732
What happened?

377
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,068
In 1884, his wife dies.

378
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,936
Do we know why or how?

379
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,872
No, we don't have
the records,

380
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:27,474
but we think it probably
was childbirth.

381
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,742
Okay.

382
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:36,583
This cursed guy,
he's very much like,

383
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,219
"I lived here.
I lived here. I died here."

384
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:42,756
So he...
I don't know how he died.

385
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,892
Do you know what
he did in life?

386
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:48,095
I believe he was a farmer.

387
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:52,533
I saw him working with land
and cows and horses and stuff.

388
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,938
Something happened
to his entire family.

389
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,706
He feels responsible.

390
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:04,411
Already this guy's life
is a sad story.

391
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,180
- Yes.
- Wh-- what happens next?

392
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:08,515
Well,
over the next 31 years,

393
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,619
he actually marries three times
and loses each of his wives.

394
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:13,887
What the hell happened?

395
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,957
The next wife,
whose name was Minnie Kutzbach,

396
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,126
she died in 1890.

397
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:21,128
Okay, so she dies, say it --
what is says here is,

398
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,764
"consumption," which is...
- Tuberculosis.

399
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:27,234
The next wife's name
was Wilhelmina Wall.

400
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:28,368
Okay.

401
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,505
She dies in 1913
of an infection

402
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:36,577
which affects her heart
and her kidneys.

403
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,279
He marries again
in less than a year,

404
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,814
in 1914.

405
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:41,915
Okay.

406
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,051
And their marriage
was the shortest of all.

407
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:47,221
And within a year
and a half, she dies.

408
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:51,225
She is struck and killed
by an automobile.

409
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,260
Okay, I'm almost
even afraid to ask

410
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,695
if this guy
got married again.

411
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,396
Yes, he did, Steve.

412
00:19:56,398 --> 00:20:00,300
In 1918, he marries
a 47-year-old widow

413
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:03,904
by the name
of Christina Barnekow.

414
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:05,506
Okay.

415
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,074
And in 1920,

416
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,243
he buys
your client's property.

417
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:11,645
All right, so they're on
my client's property.

418
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,980
Please tell me it went well
for these guys.

419
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:14,815
Well, it did for a while.

420
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,517
But in 1929,

421
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,253
John Baumler
was struck and killed

422
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,922
by a hit-and-run driver.

423
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,657
A hit-and-run,
so nobody ever got caught?

424
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,959
No one ever was caught.

425
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,461
This is one of
the worst stories

426
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,962
I've ever heard
about a guy's life.

427
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:30,464
It was a very tragic life.

428
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,804
I think that a lot
of things went wrong, like,

429
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,775
with his business
and his family.

430
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,878
His whole family dies.

431
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,314
L- like, I feel a wife.

432
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:50,784
I feel like there were kids.

433
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,921
But I do think

434
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:55,856
that they died from an illness.

435
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:58,625
And I think
that he feels responsible.

436
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,427
They got sick
and -- and they died,

437
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,330
and he feels that somehow
he contributed to that.

438
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:08,368
And then he said
that everybody died.

439
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,773
And so he felt
like he was cursed.

440
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,709
It feels like there's still
a curse here existing,

441
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:17,344
like it never ceased.

442
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,316
This curse, he thinks
it's like a monster.

443
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:31,858

445

to submit your story,

447
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:38,665
and we'll help if we can.

448
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,308
So far, I've got
a mother and daughter

449
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,742
being terrorized on a property

450
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:52,212
that's had several
tragic deaths.

451
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,813
But I need to see
if there's anything more

452
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:57,083
that could help
my investigation.

453
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,219
Searchin' through old records,
I find a man

454
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:01,387
who was crushed to death
right in front of his son.

455
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,123
Turns out it happened
in a coal mine

456
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,892
just a few thousand feet
from my client's property.

457
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,095
So I just spoke
to a mining expert

458
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:12,499
who says that tragedy
is just the tip of the iceberg.

459
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,833
He says that St. Charles' mines

460
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,401
were nothing less
than deathtraps,

461
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:17,570
and he's got the headlines
to prove it.

462
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,378
So I came across
that tragic accident

463
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,747
that happened in the mine
right near my client's property.

464
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,449
But before we get to that,

465
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:32,252
what was mining like
in St. Charles at that time?

466
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:34,988
Well, it starts
right around 1896, Steve.

467
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,090
Okay.
Um, and it's kind
of an accident in and of itself,

468
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,491
what all that happens.

469
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:41,427
Um, you got a guy
that's diggin' a water well...

470
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,695
Okay.

471
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,130
...and, he basically hits
a bunch of black rock.

472
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,932
Turns out to be coal.

473
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:48,134
And,
the next thing you know,

474
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,969
basically you got a little bit
of an economic boom goin' on.

475
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:51,638
Who would have worked
these mines?

476
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,840
A lot of,
Eastern European immigrants

477
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,108
that came into the area.

478
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,342
And you know,
you gotta remember,

479
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,877
this is before labor laws.

480
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,181
And so you got literally kids
workin' in these mines.

481
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:04,384
So, T.J., I know
mining's dangerous,

482
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:05,785
but what were
the conditions like

483
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:07,253
for the mines
here in St. Charles?

484
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,922
You got cave-ins.

485
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:10,089
You got,

486
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,025
highly explosive gases
that are down there.

487
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:14,627
I mean, all you gotta do
is look at pictures like this.

488
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:17,730
And all you can see there's --
there's the guy's legs.

489
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,933
Jeez.

490
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,801
Okay, so now the accidents
that happen

491
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:23,703
near my client's property,
what're we talkin' about?

492
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:24,904
How close was it?

493
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,806
Well, you're lookin' at
less than a 1/2-mile.

494
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:28,641
I got a map here

495
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:32,612
that actually shows
the Robert Gage No. 8 mine.

496
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:35,181
And, your client's
property's right about here.

497
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:36,482
Okay, almost towards
the end of the mine.

498
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,318
Yeah, exactly.

499
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,253
So when did
this accident happen?

500
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:41,955
The year was 1901.

501
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:45,792
And, the victim's name
is Albert Newman.

502
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,727
He and his son,
were working

503
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,529
in one of the rooms
in the mine.

504
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,130
And, he was evidently

505
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:53,533
testing out the roof
of that room

506
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,835
to, get ready
to drill into it.

507
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:57,470
Sent his son
out to another room,

508
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,840
and, the son heard what
he thought was water rushing.

509
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:04,611
And it turned out it's,
basically his dad's own blood.

510
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:07,146
He walked back
into the room to find that,

511
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:10,617
about 50 tons had,
dropped onto his dad.

512
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,118
That's a pretty sad story
when, you know --

513
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,687
you know, a son's finding
his father like that.

514
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,256
So now, T.J.,
you mentioned on the phone,

515
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:18,758
you found some more accidents
near my client's property.

516
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,095
Basically December of 1907,
we have a Ray Clipper.

517
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:25,231
Again, here's a guy
that's crushed to death.

518
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,233
What a way to go. Mnh.

519
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:29,369
This guy's only 21 years old.
- Yeah.

520
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,237
In April 1920,

521
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,274
Nelson Carl Smith
fell 20 feet.

522
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,608
All right, so, T.J.,

523
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,777
you said it started in 1896
with the mining.

524
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,281
Do we know how long the mine
by my client's property lasted?

525
00:24:41,283 --> 00:24:45,218
The Robert Gage No. 8 mine
lasted until roughly about 1931.

526
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:51,424
This cursed dead guy
is talking about tunnels,

527
00:24:51,426 --> 00:24:53,126
something about a tunnel.

528
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:54,627
Tunnels, tunnels, tunnels.

529
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,365
There's, like, multiple bodies,

530
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,234
and he's just, like,
rambling about it.

531
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:02,468
Where are they?

532
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,836
They're just lyin' on the floor.

533
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:09,442
How many?

534
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:10,877
Three or four.

535
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,145
Can you describe them?

536
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,847
It's, like,
this mangled mess of flesh.

537
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,849
He just says, "There's tunnels
all over the place,"

538
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,485
and that we should put
the bodies in the tunnel

539
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,887
'cause that's where they belong.

540
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:29,862
I saw a lot of disturbing things
on my walk,

541
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,798
but the dead lady
tormenting a living woman

542
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,434
had me the most concerned.

543
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:39,038
It was in
a small, blue room.

544
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,643
She had eyes...
- Okay.

545
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:46,279
...but they were not
human-looking.

546
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:51,718
And then her face
looked like a witch.

547
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:58,224
Is this what you saw?

548
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,026
Yes, that's what I saw.

549
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,982
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

550
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:24,283
we're ready
to reveal our findings

551
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:27,920
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

552
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,222
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Janice.

553
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:31,023
This is her daughter Kaleigh.

554
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:35,128
Um, to put it bluntly,
what's goin' on here sucks.

555
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,197
These two have no life.
They live in fear.

556
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,199
And the worst part is they're
goin' through this alone.

557
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:43,569
Now Janice's husband Michael...

558
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:49,675
He's away in Africa working
for about 18 months.

559
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:52,678
Now, they can't afford to leave,

560
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,981
but they can't go on like this,

561
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:58,384
so hopefully we can
help them out tonight.

562
00:26:58,386 --> 00:26:59,852
So now that Amy
knows just a little bit

563
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,053
about who you are,

564
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,923
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk.

565
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:07,860
There are three conscious,
dead people

566
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:11,264
that are causing issues here.

567
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:14,734
But before I get
into discussing them,

568
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,236
I wanted to tell you something

569
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:20,606
that I got when I was
in the basement.

570
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:24,510
When I was down there,
one of the deceased individuals

571
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:28,414
was going on and on
about something about tunnels.

572
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:32,819
And he was showing me maybe,
like, three or four dead people.

573
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,720
But they were such a mess.

574
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,924
Just, like, a clump of gore.

575
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:43,729
And he told me that
these bodies needed to be moved

576
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:46,332
into the tunnels
where they belonged.

577
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,601
I didn't really have to think
about this one too long.

578
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:49,969
Back in 1896,

579
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:52,672
St. Charles became a really big
mining town for coal.

580
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:57,477
Take a look at this map of...

581
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:00,079
the Robert Gage No. 8 mine.

582
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:02,482
Your house sits right here.

583
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,150
This is the end of the mine.

584
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:06,252
Yeah, that makes sense.

585
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:08,621
As you guys probably know,
mining's dangerous work.

586
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:09,789
The expert I spoke to told me

587
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,057
there was a ton
of accidents here --

588
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,359
cave-ins, explosions,
the whole nine yards.

589
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:14,560
I've actually got a photo.

590
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,429
This is a picture
of what it would look

591
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,397
like when a mine
caved in on somebody.

592
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,300
- My god.
- Wow.

593
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:22,635
In 1901,

594
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:25,571
an accident just like this
happened within 5,000 feet

595
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:26,839
from your property here.

596
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:31,277
The man working was basically
crushed to death.

597
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,411
Wow.

598
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,619
The first dead person
that I'm going to talk about

599
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:42,288
is the female
that I encountered.

600
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,890
She's very creepy.

601
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:45,691
She kind of spooked me.

602
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,895
She likes to torture
living people.

603
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:51,664
One of the things
that I saw her doing

604
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,467
was messing around
with shoes and, like,

605
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:57,236
throwing them
and moving them about.

606
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:02,575
And in the very back bedroom,
um, I saw her smother people.

607
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:04,243
Like, they couldn't breathe.

608
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,345
Is it possible that these guys
would be able to see her?

609
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,347
It's possible.

610
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,349
Janice encountered a female.

611
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:11,751
Tried to slap me.

612
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:14,520
Ooh! Okay.

613
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,821
Tell her what happened
in the kitchen.

614
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:17,323
I was doin' the dishes,

615
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:19,191
and the tea bags
were on the top shelf.

616
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:22,662
And they came flying off
and landed, um, behind my feet.

617
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,196
Okay.

618
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:25,932
Does she do anything else,
this woman?

619
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:30,636
Yes. One of her things to do
is to creep up behind people.

620
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:34,040
One of her favorite areas
is this blue room here.

621
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:39,612
I saw her, like,
creeping out of the closet.

622
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:43,516
Very slowly opening the door,

623
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:44,884
then she'll rush.

624
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:53,059
I thought that maybe
the living would experience,

625
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:56,162
like, kind of a panic attack
kind of feeling...

626
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:58,564
- Associated with this.

627
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:03,002
That closet, um,
is also connected to my bedroom.

628
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:05,104
- And I'll here, like,

629
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:07,440
knocking noises, almost like
stuff is falling over.

630
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,775
- Interesting.
- She watches.

631
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:10,943
- I feel...
- Yeah.

632
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:13,346
...constantly watched
wherever we are.

633
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:16,182
I mean, I always feel like
I have to look over my shoulder

634
00:30:16,184 --> 00:30:19,285
and make sure that, you know,
there's nobody there.

635
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:23,055
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw her doing.

636
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:27,760
****.

637
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:33,399
- My god.
- My god.

638
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,239
I don't like that.

639
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,215
That's creepy.

640
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,784
She's...in my room as well?

641
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:52,918
Which room is yours?

642
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,454
- The pink one.
- İn the closet.

643
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:58,557
And that's why I don't
like my closet.

644
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,364
Who do you think
this woman might have been

645
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,699
when she was alive?

646
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:09,468
She was actually pretty.

647
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,972
I got that she had either
a lot of men in her life

648
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:15,975
or was
married multiple times.

649
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:19,545
Um...her family tried

650
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,048
or did have her locked away
at some point.

651
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,318
They thought that she was kind
of a disgrace to the family.

652
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,656
And I got that she is jealous
of a female here,

653
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:33,125
and that's why
she's acting out so much.

654
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,265
Well, we got the elephant
in the room to talk about.

655
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,368
I know the three of us are
thinking about the same person.

656
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,770
You know what? This is
who we're talking about.

657
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:48,908
These are the remains
of her mother-in-law Ruth.

658
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,444
In 2013, Ruth dies of...
leukemia?

659
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:52,578
Yes.

660
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,046
Now, when they brought
the ashes home

661
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:55,414
is when things got violent.

662
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,749
Wow.

663
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,884
Do me a favor, Janice.
Tell her how she was in life.

664
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:02,421
She wasn't a very good person.
She traumatized Mike.

665
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:08,561
When she was married
to Mike's dad,

666
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:12,832
she had multiple lovers,

667
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,668
and did it in front of Mike.

668
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,003
She didn't like you either.

669
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,406
No, she didn't like me.

670
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,374
I got photos of her
at different ages.

671
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,747
Wow.

672
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:31,484
Any idea if this might be
who you saw?

673
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:32,885
- Yes.
- Okay.

674
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:35,321
Her face is
exactly like that.

675
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:46,398
What else is goin' on?

676
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,769
Then I saw a dead child.

677
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:54,006
So I'd actually put him
between 7 and 8 years of age.

678
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:56,442
And he was wearing
a funny outfit,

679
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:58,577
kind of resembled
lederhosen.

680
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:04,350
He interacts consistently
with the living here.

681
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:06,552
I saw him touching
living people.

682
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:10,156
Um, specifically,
caressing faces,

683
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,158
playing with their hair.

684
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,328
The problem with him is that if
there's any living children

685
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,030
within the vicinity,

686
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:23,335
he will try to, like,
glom on to them.

687
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:29,708
It's very bad for the living
because it can make them sick.

688
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,378
It can cause
major health problems,

689
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,816
one of which
could be heart issues.

690
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,719
He can also become
violent.

691
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:43,889
When I was talking to him
in the middle room,

692
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:49,662
I suddenly had, like,
a horrible blow to my head.

693
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,833
Well, that just about hit
every friggin' experience

694
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,201
you guys are goin' through.

695
00:33:55,203 --> 00:34:00,039
I have had stomach problems
ever since I was a baby.

696
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,941
Now on top of that,

697
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:05,077
there's something wrong
with my heart.

698
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,345
Wow.

699
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:08,047
They still have no idea
what's wrong.

700
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:18,624
See, I think she's doing this.
I think she's doin' you.

701
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:23,062
I think the kid's doin' you.

702
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,901
It's like you're his toy.

703
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:32,938
You said there are
three dead people

704
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,640
you're concerned about.

705
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:38,043
The other person was
this guy,

706
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,312
and he is
a pretty serious threat.

707
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:43,515
He's somehow related
to this little kid.

708
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:46,418
I don't know if it was father
or grandfather.

709
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,887
One of the things
about this guy

710
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,156
is that he feels
extreme sense of guilt.

711
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:53,425
Um, I saw him at one point

712
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,094
where he, like,
falls to his knees.

713
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:57,763
And he's like,
"Aah! It's all the curse.

714
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,132
It's the curse.
I caused the curse."

715
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,568
Somehow he lost
his entire family

716
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,271
and he feels completely
responsible for it.

717
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:07,606
What I got about him was
that he worked outside a lot.

718
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,275
I felt like he was a farmer.

719
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,277
He lived on the property,
died on the property,

720
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,145
was buried on this property.

721
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:14,647
So I do have one guy
in my research

722
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:16,415
that fits that bill.

723
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,650
One of the first owners

724
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:19,952
of the property
was a guy named John Baumler.

725
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:21,320
He was a German immigrant

726
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:23,923
who came to the country in 1880
at the age of 29.

727
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:27,026
So when she said "lederhosen,"
it kind of made sense.

728
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,094
Now you mentioned he lost
his entire family.

729
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:30,596
When he crossed the Atlantic
with his wife,

730
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,831
he had a baby girl
and a 2-year-old boy.

731
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,667
But within 2 weeks
of arriving in America,

732
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,302
they were both gone, both dead.

733
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:37,703
Jeez.

734
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:40,439
We think they died of some kind
of disease on the boat.

735
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,941
There's no records of it.

736
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,209
He must have felt guilty
about putting his family at risk

737
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,011
by bringing them over here.

738
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,280
Now I wish this was the end
of John Baumler's story,

739
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,516
but this was just the beginning.

740
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:53,986
Four years after gettin'
into town, Baumler's wife dies.

741
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:56,288
Now, get this --
over the next 30 years,

742
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,690
he's married three more times,

743
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:59,658
and every single one
of them died.

744
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,628
- That's insane!
- He marries a fifth time.

745
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,164
No.
He should've just stopped.

746
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,599
For 9 years, until 1929,

747
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,768
he lived right here on your land
where the house is built.

748
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,439
And, he gets killed
by a hit-and-run.

749
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:15,407
What?
I got
his death certificate here.

750
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:18,610
This guy had one of the most
miserable lives I've...

751
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:20,045
My god.

752
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,848
...ever come across.
- Wow.

753
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,684
Do you think this is
who you might've seen?
Yes.

754
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:31,557
Now you said you were worried
about this guy.

755
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,625
What's he do?
- This was interesting.

756
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:36,562
He can't do
anything physical,

757
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:41,533
but he's, like,
mastered emotional abuse.

758
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:44,403
Living people will become
extremely overwhelmed

759
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:47,439
by these sudden emotions.

760
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:51,410
One of them is shame, feeling
an intense amount of shame

761
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,680
for no reason,
guilt for no reason,

762
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:57,483
feeling sad for no reason.

763
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,719
I...

764
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:05,124
I feel guilty for not bein' able
to take care of her.

765
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:10,596
I feel guilty about things
that happened in my past.

766
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:13,132
I've been constantly saying
that I'm overwhelmed.

767
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:16,835
Do you think that this guy
could be influencing her?

768
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,170
Yeah.

769
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:23,675
His favorite area
is the basement.

770
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:28,981
When I was down there,
I got,

771
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:33,052
that he had his sights
set on a male.

772
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,456
He felt like this male was

773
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,592
an extremely easy target
for him.

774
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:44,196
I got that the living male comes
and goes from the house a lot.

775
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,733
I got that he does have
emotional issues.

776
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,903
And he will act out,

777
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:53,405
in anger and lash out.

778
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:54,840
I got that
if this living male

779
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:58,377
is exposed
to this dead male

780
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:01,180
for a long period of time,

781
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:04,583
that it would, like,
drive him insane.

782
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:05,784
You know we're talkin'
about Mike.

783
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,253
He's the only living male
in this house.

784
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:10,989
When he spend a lot
of time in the basement,

785
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:13,158
it's like
walking on eggshells.

786
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,095
He's agitated, angry.

787
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,530
We can't do anything right.

788
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,199
You know, he should be nicer.

789
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:23,936
But, I mean,
if he's in the basement,

790
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,804
it's horrible.

791
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,774
Does he recall these outbursts
that he has?

792
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:31,677
No.
Okay. It's worse --
worse than I thought.

793
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:35,180
This dead guy
you're talkin' about,

794
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,448
what does he want?

795
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:42,154
He views this entire space
as his personal hell.

796
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:46,291
He's very depressed
and he wants to be alone.

797
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:48,760
He is at the point
where he's willing to do

798
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:53,165
whatever it takes
to get y'all out of this space.

799
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,919
Well, Janice,
it's been a tough night,

800
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,821
but at least you got
a lot of answers.

801
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,456
The only thing
we haven't told you yet

802
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,125
is whether you can
make this home safe again

803
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,094
so you can finally
get the peace

804
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:26,498
you deserve for you
and your family.

805
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,135
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

806
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:33,405
The first thing
that you would need to do

807
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:37,409
is to find a male medium

808
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:40,612
and a priest.

809
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:43,315
The first day,

810
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:47,352
you're going to deal
with Grandma.

811
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:51,990
And the male medium
will start with her.

812
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:55,894
My hope is that
you'll let her vent,

813
00:39:55,896 --> 00:40:00,265
and some things can be
just kind of laid to rest.

814
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,800
And then she'll move on.

815
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:04,369
Now if she doesn't do this,

816
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:08,207
then the priest
will then make her leave.

817
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,576
Okay, so how's he gonna
take care of that?

818
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,578
He'll exorcise her.

819
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:18,750
For the boy,
bring the male medium back.

820
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,986
Male medium
will engage the boy --

821
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:22,888
this might be
for a few hours --

822
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,356
and will move him on.

823
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,192
Now another day,

824
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:30,662
again for a few hours,
male medium comes back,

825
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:34,499
and he's going to focus
on the cursed dead male.

826
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:38,604
Now, this male, as well,
may have a lot to talk about.

827
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,372
Just sit back
and listen,

828
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:43,342
and then he'll move on.

829
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,016
The look on your face
went from sobbing to, like,

830
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:52,584
"Hey, I can stay in my house."

831
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,286
I can stay in my house.
Yeah.

832
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:57,556
- How's that make you feel?
- Wonderful. Yeah.

833
00:40:57,558 --> 00:41:00,592
I'm gonna take Amy's advice.
Yeah.

834
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:02,094
Okay.

835
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,962
That's the first time
I've seen you smile in a week.

836
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,330
Yeah.

837
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:08,066
- How do you feel, Kaleigh?
- Relieved that we can stay.

838
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,736
Will her health issues
get better?

839
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,104
- Yes.
- Cool.

840
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:14,106
What about Mike,
when he comes home?

841
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,407
If they do all this,

842
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:17,643
will his attitude change
when he's in the basement?

843
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:21,346
Yeah. Yeah.

844
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,382
I'm very happy with...

845
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:25,884
That we got answers, for one.

846
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:29,554
Yeah, 'cause we've been dealing
with this for a while.

847
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,527
With the help
of a male medium and a priest,

848
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,797
Janice and Kaleigh
can set the dead free,

849
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:42,234
giving them a safe and peaceful
home for Mike to return to.
