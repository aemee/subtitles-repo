1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,350
You're in trouble,
big, big trouble.

2
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:17,815
Tell us
what we need to do

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,985
to make this safe
for my girls.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,085
She's getting
bashed in the head.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,990
It's turned out to be
the house of horrors.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,090
They're living
here in danger?

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,625
Yes.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,670
This is not good,
not good at all.

9
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:35,887
I just hear death.

10
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:38,070
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,700
God.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,710
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

13
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:41,875
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,510
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,075
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,980
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

17
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,215
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,145
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,990
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,790
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

21
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,392
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,925
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,690
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,190
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,400
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:06,560
They're everywhere.

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,935
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,030
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,835
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,870
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,075
...until the very end...

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,745
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,640
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,715
That's it.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,010
...or time to get out.

36
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,250
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,830
I'm in the small town of Medina

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,900
between Rochester
and Buffalo, New York.

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,240
I got a call from a young
mom named Kelsey.

40
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,310
Now, she was sobbing
saying the dead

41
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,662
are going after her babies

42
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,945
and brainwashing her mom.

43
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,450
I'm not sure exactly what
the hell she meant by that.

44
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,720
But she sounded
so scared for her kids,

45
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,220
I had to take the case.

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,825
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,560
I sweep the house
from top to bottom

48
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,270
looking for
any leading information --

49
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:17,565
photographs, family heirlooms.

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,940
Even a baby's crib
can influence her findings.

51
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,280
So it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

52
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,675
When I'm done, the location

53
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,580
will be ready
for tonight's walk.

54
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,230
Boy.
This isn't good.

55
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,005
So there's, like, you know,

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,635
some dead people here who...

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,510
I think that maybe
they can ****

58
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:57,145
with living people.

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,510
And they're bad.
They're very bad.

60
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,720
And they want to do things
to living people.

61
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:06,855
I don't know why there's

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,520
so many **** dead
people in this house.

63
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,485
Maybe it was a hospital

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,790
or maybe it was
a crazy house at one time.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,365
Maybe it was a boarding house.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,170
And then, I hear there
are demons lurking.

67
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,045
So, Kelsey,
I'm glad I'm here because

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,050
when we spoke on the phone,
you sounded pretty upset.

69
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,745
What's going on
in this house?

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,320
My main concern
is my daughter Zoey.

71
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:40,387
Um, she's 3 years old.

72
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,420
She's seeing things.

73
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,155
She's afraid.

74
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,610
She won't go into
her room by herself.

75
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,030
And you have,
another child as well?

76
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:50,900
We have Lucy.
She's 2 months.

77
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,895
Two small kids.

78
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,700
Looks like it's
affecting you, too.

79
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,235
Yeah.

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,610
It's a daily struggle
just to keep the girls safe.

81
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,205
The girls
are my main concern.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,740
And I have to stay
strong for them.

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,430
As far as activity goes,
give me a --

84
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,110
kind of a list
of what's happening.

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,550
There's been loud screams,
things moving,

86
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:16,602
shadow figures,
apparitions.

87
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:19,620
And now
it's gotten physical.

88
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,030
Okay. So how long have
you guys been here?

89
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,925
We've lived here
18 months.

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,800
Now, when I pulled up,
this place looked like a --

91
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,835
a huge factory.

92
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,770
Um,
how big is this place?

93
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,487
It's 6,200 square feet.

94
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,170
And it has 12 rooms.

95
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,475
Wow.

96
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,880
Now, do you know any history
about the house?

97
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,275
We just know that it used
to be an inn.

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,480
- And how old is it?
- It's about 200 years old.

99
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:47,352
So who exactly
lives here?

100
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,238
Myself,
my daughter Zoey,

101
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:53,055
my daughter Lucy,
my mom.

102
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,460
You mentioned on the phone
your mom's got some kind

103
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,830
of strange connection,
obsession with the house.

104
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,965
What's that all about?

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,930
She seems to be
really attached to it.

106
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,170
She doesn't seem to ever
want to leave the house.

107
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:10,010
- That's strange.
- Since we've lived here,

108
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,740
her health has just
declined rapidly.

109
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,335
Is she the only
one getting sick?

110
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,780
We're all exhausted
all the time.

111
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:22,190
We all are sick
all the time.

112
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,825
It -- it feels like home.

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,660
But it feels like
we're sharing our home

114
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,460
with something nasty.

115
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,900
I don't even know
how anyone can stay here.

116
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,600
There are just so many dead.

117
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,575
I feel very dizzy.

118
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,040
Very sick,
horrible, horrible...

119
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,315
We can't focus.

120
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,410
I think that the living here

121
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,385
would experience
extreme sadness.

122
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,250
When I first walked in,
I literally wanted

123
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:58,520
to start crying,
extreme depression.

124
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,330
All right, Kelsey.
This is a pretty big room.

125
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:08,830
Why'd you bring me
in here?

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,140
Well, one night I was sitting
right outside that door.

127
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,640
All of a sudden,
I heard footsteps

128
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,905
walking towards the door.

129
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,745
And the door just slammed
right in my face.

130
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,550
And so you hear, like,
footsteps like this?

131
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:29,185
Yep.

132
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,320
Any doors and windows
open for ventilation

133
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,420
that this might've
slammed shut on its own?

134
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,490
No, this happened
just a few weeks ago,

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,000
when it was winter.

136
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,535
Like that?

137
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,735
Exactly.

138
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,400
That must've scared
the hell out of you.

139
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,910
Yeah.

140
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,945
Living people, they have
a problem with the doors.

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,780
The doorknob's always...
tch, tch, tch, always rattling.

142
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,490
And all I'm seeing is --
is, like,

143
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,327
the doors had blood on them.

144
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,095
There was blood
on the floor.

145
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,800
Something is trying
to get inside.

146
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,035
Anything else?

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,000
I looked up and saw
a woman walk

148
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,270
from our dining room
into our kitchen.

149
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,440
She was wearing
this long, white dress,

150
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,527
looked like from
a long time ago.

151
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,271
So did you go
into the kitchen

152
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,980
to see
what the hell it was?

153
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,115
The fear overcomes me.

154
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,250
And I just can't bring myself
to walk in and see.

155
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,855
Well, okay.
Anything else?

156
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,120
Um, one night, I was sitting
down here on the couch.

157
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,630
All of a sudden,
I heard this ear-piercing,

158
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:47,065
horrific scream
of a woman.

159
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,930
And it sounded like
she was being hurt.

160
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,100
That was what was
startling about it.

161
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,275
I'm hearing a woman screaming.

162
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,910
Is she trying to get in?
Or is she trying to get out?

163
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,120
They could see her, like,
as a full-body apparition.

164
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,180
What would they see?

165
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,890
Like a white dress
or something.

166
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:11,590
I guess maybe, like,
a nightgown.

167
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,305
Freaking out.

168
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,555
Her heart's pounding.

169
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,770
I think she was murdered.

170
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,610
So this is Zoey's room?

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,250
And the reason
I took the case,

172
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,880
um, what's going on
in here?

173
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,285
She would wake up,
start crying,

174
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,420
refuse to lay back down,
refuse to go back to sleep,

175
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:49,495
talking about shadow figures
and, mean men.

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,770
One day, Zoey had got away
from us and took off.

177
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:57,722
And we found her at the top
of the stairs

178
00:08:57,757 --> 00:09:00,640
holding what looked
to be someone's hand.

179
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,240
My heart dropped.
I -- I stopped.

180
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,445
I froze.

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,730
It was one of
the more scary things

182
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:08,980
that have happened here
for me.

183
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,750
Okay. Anything else?

184
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,015
Um, yeah.

185
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,150
I will be walking up
the stairs,

186
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:16,052
walking past this room.

187
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,885
And I'll look
in the room.

188
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,520
And there'll be
a black shadow figure

189
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,915
standing right
in the window.

190
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,265
It's happened three times.

191
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,665
And I was literally
afraid for my life.

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,030
So could there be
somebody standing outside

193
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,470
and a car going by
with the lights

194
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,070
and it reflecting
in here?

195
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,470
No. It was very solid.

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,910
Looked like an actual man
was standing there.

197
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,340
What are you hoping
to get out of all this?

198
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,675
Answers.

199
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,145
Tell us
what we need to do

200
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,420
to make this safe
for my girls.

201
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,920
Okay.

202
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,090
This person's
in big trouble,

203
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,630
big, big trouble.

204
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,400
This is not good,
not good at all.

205
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,610
And I feel like
these dead people

206
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,810
are very focused on this person.

207
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:14,010
Violent, very violent...

208
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,115
...anger, hatred,

209
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:26,855
being surrounded by these
very bad dead people.

210
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,490
And the only reason why they
would be focused on this person

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,795
is because they think
they can make

212
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,700
this person kill yourself
or kill everybody.

213
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,440
This living person is in danger.

214
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,160
So I was talking to Kelsey,
and she basically said

215
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:03,060
that you're kind of
obsessed with the house.

216
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,895
I guess that's fair.

217
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,015
I knew
three steps in the door

218
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,110
that this
is where we should be.

219
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,170
It's turned out to be,
at times,

220
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:17,005
the house of horrors.

221
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,310
I understand you've been having
some health issues, too.

222
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,080
I had to have
two back surgeries

223
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,915
and a hip surgery.

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,770
And I just can't seem
to heal here.

225
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,555
Have you had experiences
living here?

226
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,760
Yes. I've had experiences
with the walk-in closet.

227
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,895
I thought to myself,

228
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,160
"Maybe this is some
kind of a portal."

229
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,835
You hear
a woman screaming.

230
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,540
I mean, guttural,
painful screams

231
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,005
come out of that closet.

232
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,270
Well, how the hell
do you sleep in here?

233
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:49,705
I don't sleep in here.

234
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,810
I sleep in what
would be Zoey's room.

235
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,545
I started sleeping
in there,

236
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,065
thinking I would get
a better night's sleep.

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,550
But it has not worked
out that way at all.

238
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,615
Why not?

239
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm having
these horrific nightmares.

240
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,685
Okay, what
kind of nightmares?

241
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,590
Every single dream,
it has to do with somebody

242
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,295
in this house
who is in peril.

243
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,800
What do you think
is going on here?

244
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,035
It's like this house

245
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,170
is,
a paranormal highway.

246
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,920
The living person
in this room gets sick a lot.

247
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:26,040
There is a Satanic vortex
that's in their closet.

248
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,745
Everything in this room

249
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,320
that happens is due
to this **** closet

250
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:34,115
and this ****
vortex in there.

251
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,290
I think that they would
see things in there.

252
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:37,585
Like what?

253
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,920
I don't know,
maybe having dreams.

254
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,695
Lots of stress.
Lots of stress.

255
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,630
I see somebody, like,
crying so much

256
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,330
they puke kind of thing.

257
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,070
So scared, so scared,
crying and crying and crying.

258
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,260
So anything else?

259
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,405
The most significant

260
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,040
and the most
frightening experience

261
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,245
that I've had here
so far has to be

262
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,780
walking over to the window
and looking out.

263
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,790
And there were, like,
8 or 10 shadow figures.

264
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:17,460
They were shaped
like a human form.

265
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,965
But they were solid black.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,170
And they were just
staring right at the house.

267
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:26,600
And just one by one,
they turned around

268
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,070
and walked down
towards the river.

269
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,875
It terrified me.

270
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,440
You sure these were
shadow people

271
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,650
and not a bunch of people
that were dressed in black?

272
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,550
No. No, there's a street
light out there.

273
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,515
And it was lit up.

274
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,420
And you could see they were
this solid black forms.

275
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,120
They weren't people.

276
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,790
No.

277
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,330
It's like you're
constantly anticipating

278
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,495
what might happen next.

279
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,270
And it's really difficult
to live like that.

280
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,365
It takes its toll
on everybody.

281
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,940
There's not a lot of life left
in this house anymore.

282
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,510
I just saw, like, a really tall,
dark shadow man.

283
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,450
And he just walked
straight right back

284
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,487
and right into there.

285
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,455
He was **** tall, too,

286
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,520
'cause he must've been
right up on that tree there.

287
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,630
He says that there's more.

288
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,505
So those shadowed...things,

289
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,840
they've been here
for a long, long time.

290
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,145
I think that living people
would see them.

291
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,820
But it doesn't seem like
they're much interested in them.

292
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,450
Any idea how the living
would see them?

293
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,620
Like human-shaped shadow people.

294
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,530
Are the living here
in danger from them?

295
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:59,600
I can't say 100%
that they're safe.

296
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,255
Okay, Cindy,
why'd you bring me over here?

297
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,805
I was walking down
this set of stairs.

298
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,010
I got probably six
or eight stairs from the bottom.

299
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:18,850
And it felt like somebody
took their arm

300
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,185
and just swooshed

301
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,950
and knocked my knees out
from underneath me.

302
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,725
And I flew and hit hard.
- All right.

303
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,960
So when I came up these steps,
these seemed pretty sturdy.

304
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,565
They are.

305
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,400
- You could've got killed.
- It's possible.

306
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:40,005
And you're still
in this house?

307
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,910
And you're gonna say
you're not obsessed by it?

308
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,840
I don't want to leave it.

309
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,350
Okay.

310
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,385
There's a man.

311
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,705
I think it's a man.

312
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,730
But he sounds inhuman.

313
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:59,720
He doesn't want us here.

314
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,955
He grabbed my wrist and, like,

315
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,260
pinched it between
the bones, you know?

316
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,495
It, like,
almost felt like a ice pick.

317
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,900
And then, he was grabbing
my neck here like,

318
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,170
you know, this,
my shoulder,

319
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,857
and then my jaw.

320
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,475
He is very physical.

321
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,610
As far as being able
to touch people.

322
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,285
And then, I saw somebody
get shoved,

323
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,420
a living person, a female,
get shoved from behind.

324
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,690
So he's somebody
I would worry about.

325
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,255
I think it's dangerous.

326
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,530
I feel like he's, like,
trying to attach to me.

327
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:40,200
My God.
**** Get off of me!

328
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,065
So I made some calls,
and Kelsey's right.

329
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,630
The house is almost 200 years
old and used to be an inn.

330
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:01,165
I'm heading back there
to meet a local historian

331
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,300
who says the guy that built it
had such a tragic time there,

332
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,240
he probably wishes
he never laid his eyes

333
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,940
on it in the first place.

334
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,145
Sounds like my clients
were right.

335
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,600
This place was built
about 200 years ago.

336
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,812
Very close.
We found, um, that the house

337
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,955
was actually constructed
around 1837.

338
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,460
It's regarded as one
of the largest cobblestone

339
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:30,365
buildings
in North America.

340
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,770
She also mentioned
that it might've been an inn.

341
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,635
Yes, that is correct.
It was an inn.

342
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,055
Um, and it was there to cater
to the stagecoach traffic

343
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,440
that was traveling from Buffalo
to Rochester at the time.

344
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,110
And we actually have
a photograph here

345
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:47,910
from 1870
that shows, um,

346
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
what it would've looked like
from that time period.

347
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:51,850
And this picture makes it
a lot more bustling

348
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:52,985
than it is today.

349
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,320
- Absolutely.
- What do we know about the guy

350
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:57,155
that built this monster
of a house?

351
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,490
The inn was constructed
by Zachariah Spencer.

352
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,900
He was a wealthy farmer
from Connecticut.

353
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:03,982
So you mentioned
on the phone

354
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:04,995
that he's probably
even sorry

355
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,950
he set eyes on this location.
Why was that?

356
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:10,870
Yes, um, he turns the business
over eventually

357
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,305
to his son Henry,
um, in 1843.

358
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,595
Henry was about 28 years old
at the time.

359
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,850
And at that point in time,
he is a loner.

360
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:20,945
Um, he's not married.

361
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,065
And he has no --
no children to speak of.

362
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,150
That's kind of strange
for that time period.

363
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,415
Isn't it?
- Yes.

364
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,020
Okay. So now,
Henry's got the business.

365
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,325
What happens?

366
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,830
Um, from the best we can tell,
he runs it quite well.

367
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:37,530
And then, two years later,
he kills himself.

368
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,417
Okay, and how do
we know that?

369
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,235
We do have
a deed transfer

370
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,600
that reverts the property
back to Zachariah

371
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,875
that says, um,

372
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,405
Henry died at his own device.
- All right.

373
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,150
Could we assume he committed
suicide on the property?

374
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,515
Yes.

375
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,415
Now that Zachariah's
got the property

376
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,380
and the business back,
does he run it again?

377
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,715
Or does he sell it?

378
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,620
This time, he transitioned
the business to his other sons,

379
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,355
Burrall
and Samuel Spencer.

380
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,790
All right.
So how'd these guys do?

381
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,490
Um, they overextended
themselves.

382
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,230
And eventually ran
the business bankrupt.

383
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,330
Burrall started,
forging checks

384
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,270
about to
the extent of $270,000

385
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,735
at that point in time.

386
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,470
What are we talking about today?
What would that be?

387
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:23,240
By today's standards
of about $6 million.

388
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,640
Wow. Okay.

389
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,950
So this poor guy, Zachariah,
comes over, successful guy.

390
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:29,515
He's got all these kids.

391
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,150
One kid, Henry, who's 28
and winds up killing himself.

392
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,185
Yes.

393
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,555
And then,
the other two knuckleheads

394
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,190
wind up running the business
into the ground.

395
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,060
- Yes.
- All right.

396
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,065
There's, like, two guys.

397
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,270
It feels like
older teens maybe.

398
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:51,440
And they're bad.
They're very bad.

399
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,105
I don't like these guys.

400
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,275
I don't know
if they're human.

401
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,045
They might be
pretending to be human.

402
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,050
Like, I don't know
if they're really dead kids

403
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,285
or if they're demons.

404
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,920
And they're, like, talking about
Satanism and ****

405
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,895
Them, you got to
bargain with them.

406
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,490
Like, if you agree
for them to do something,

407
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,860
then you're gonna ****
pay a price.

408
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,195
That's all I know.

409
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,130
What sort of things
will he do?

410
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,730
They can scare them.

411
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,990
They can harm them,
cause accidents,

412
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,205
cause accidents
where people die.

413
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,110
And I think also that they
influence the living very much.

414
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:36,080
And I think that they could
influence a living person

415
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:39,720
into harming themselves
or somebody else.

416
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,160
It's not a good situation.

417
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,595
If you need us
to investigate

418
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,495
unexplained activity
in your home,

419
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,915
go to "The Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

420
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,300
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story.

421
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:56,370
And we'll help if we can.

422
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,820
So far, I've got
a family worried sick

423
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:08,920
over their children's safety
on a property

424
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,965
where a former owner
committed suicide.

425
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But I need to see
if there's anything else.

426
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,295
Searching through old records,

427
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,930
I find a disturbing
article about a local farmhand

428
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,605
who murdered a 13-year-old girl

429
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,225
right next to
my client's property.

430
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,170
Now, for some reason,
the local cops

431
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,272
won't talk to me
about this case.

432
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:29,340
So I reached out
to a local author

433
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,480
who says this was one
of the most gruesome crimes

434
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,980
in the town's history.

435
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,720
Were you able to find out
anything about this farmhand

436
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,155
that killed
this 13-year-old girl?

437
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,700
Yes, the man we're talking
about is Eugene Emory.

438
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:50,360
He was a farmhand
local to the area.

439
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,170
And there's no known
photograph of him,

440
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:54,900
but we did find
a sketch of him.

441
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:55,905
Okay.

442
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,175
He was described
as 5'8", clean-shaven.

443
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,110
You have any idea how old he
might've been in this sketch?

444
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,610
Yes, at the time that sketch
was done, 40 years old.

445
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,815
40, okay.

446
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,945
This guy have
any priors?

447
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,335
Not really.
But farmers in the area

448
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,655
had said that he liked
the young girls.

449
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,520
Okay, so do we know when
he starts working for the people

450
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,255
that live next door
to my client's property?

451
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,210
He started working
for the Grimes family in 1888.

452
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:24,130
Immediately was attracted
to their daughter, Cora,

453
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,902
then about 12 years old.

454
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:27,605
What do we know
about her?

455
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,990
Described as
a very pretty girl --

456
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,302
brunette with curly hair,
brown eyes.

457
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,638
Supposedly, quite
a brilliant girl.

458
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,940
He was actually
trying to court her.

459
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,380
And they had been
seen out in the area

460
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:40,985
in the horse
and carriage.

461
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,770
He had brought her
a few little gifts.

462
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,485
And the family knew
about all this?

463
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,090
Well, they did.
I don't think, at first,

464
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,520
they realized
it was that serious.

465
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,665
I, feel weak,
real weak.

466
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,985
Really, really,
really, really,

467
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,270
really, really,
really weak.

468
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:01,835
Hard to walk.

469
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm seeing the panicky girl
who was murdered again.

470
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,757
And she's starting
to show me flashes

471
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,940
of who she was
and what happened to her.

472
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,110
She has dark brown hair,
white nightie,

473
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,380
hourglass figure,
about 5'2", no shoes.

474
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,960
It's warm, hot even,
sticky hot.

475
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:25,397
Something's wrong here.

476
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:27,800
Something's wrong here.

477
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:30,430
My God.
My God.

478
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,685
Take me to the murder.
What happened?

479
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,470
Well, on June 24, 1889,
summer evening,

480
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,180
Cora's parents
leave the premises.

481
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:43,345
Okay.

482
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,050
Well, Cora and Eugene
were having a discussion.

483
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,385
And she's trying
to let him know

484
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,150
that their relationship
isn't gonna go forward.

485
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:50,655
And he's not liking this.

486
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,855
She's trying to make it
clear to him

487
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,820
that she thinks there's
too big an age difference.

488
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,957
And he's not
the boss of her.

489
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:58,826
She leaves to go
into the house.

490
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,625
But in doing so,
she turns her --

491
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,330
her back on him.
He picks up a piece of firewood.

492
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:08,000
Using it like a club,
he bashes her in the head.

493
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:10,322
That first blow
probably killed her.

494
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:12,610
But he strikes her
two more times.

495
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,210
She's getting bashed
in the head.

496
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,090
Like, I'm just seeing
her head explode.

497
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,975
And I'm seeing, like,
brain and hair.

498
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,770
Something about
the evil that men do.

499
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,552
I don't know who this is.
They're in me.

500
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,300
That **** hurts.
- Who's jumping you?

501
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:41,870
A chick who's being murdered.

502
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:43,910
****

503
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,740
Get out.

504
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,815
All right.
So now what happens?

505
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,780
Well, Emory takes off
through the woods.

506
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,080
And the men form a posse.

507
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,690
He sees 'em in the night
with their lanterns.

508
00:24:57,725 --> 00:24:59,990
And he knows they're
in pursuit of him.

509
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:01,755
He turns himself in,

510
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,160
confesses to the sheriff
that he loved this girl.

511
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:07,225
He's weepy.
He's sobbing.

512
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,295
But he doesn't know
why he did it.

513
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,330
This was big news
at the time.

514
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,635
What happened at trial?

515
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,305
They do convict him
of second-degree murder.

516
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,940
And he's sentenced
to life imprisonment.

517
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,405
He ended up
dying in prison

518
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,660
of natural causes,
kidney failure,

519
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,880
after serving
almost 13 years.

520
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,050
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk.

521
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,390
But what has me the most
concerned are the dead

522
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:37,855
coming out of the vortex
in the closet

523
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,560
and then surrounding
a living person in bed.

524
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:45,482
There's dead people everywhere.

525
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:49,978
There was a man on the left.

526
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:54,440
And he's in his early 60s.

527
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:57,345
Then there's a lady.

528
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,045
And she's tiny.
She's probably, like, 5'2".

529
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,990
And then, at the end of the bed,
just completely black.

530
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,295
Amy,
is this what you saw?

531
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,630
Yes, that's what I saw.

532
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,060
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

533
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,160
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

534
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,200
and our clients
for the first time.

535
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,832
Now, Amy, this is Kelsey.

536
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,430
And this is her mom, Cindy.

537
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,100
It's like these ladies are
in a dysfunctional relationship

538
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,300
with this house.

539
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,470
And what I mean by that
is it tortures them

540
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:51,175
physically and emotionally.

541
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,740
But they're drawn to it like
they're obsessed with it.

542
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,435
But there's a reason Kelsey
called us in.

543
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,120
This is her 3-year-old
daughter, Zoey,

544
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:02,215
and Lucy, who's a newborn.

545
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,190
Kelsey's convinced that the dead
here are picking on Zoey.

546
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,092
And she is not sure if
it's safe for them to be here.

547
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,960
Now that Amy knows just
a little bit about you guys,

548
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:15,770
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

549
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:17,035
Something
about this location

550
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,310
is that there were
a lot of dead people here.

551
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:26,005
And I could not
figure out why.

552
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,410
I was speculating maybe
it was an asylum or a hospital.

553
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,685
Maybe it was
a boarding house.

554
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,915
So I was extremely confused

555
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,760
as to why there were all
these random dead people here.

556
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:42,355
Some of them can
affect the living

557
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,230
because I felt a lot of
depression and anxiety.

558
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,130
Obviously, the house
is really old.

559
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,765
Um, a lot of people
have been through here.

560
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,170
It was built in 1837.
Originally, it was an inn.

561
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,910
We actually have a photograph
of your place from 1870.

562
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:03,215
Geez, it looks
about the same.

563
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,550
- Yeah, there's nothing...
- That's crazy.

564
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:07,180
Not much has changed.

565
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,050
Now, as far
as depression goes,

566
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,650
tell Amy about that.

567
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,825
Since moving in here,

568
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,920
I think we all are
drained and tired.

569
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,060
And I think our attitudes
are different.

570
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,965
Yeah.
I mean, there...

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,070
I am always on edge, always.

572
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,430
If it wasn't for Zoey,

573
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,570
there would be no life
in this house.

574
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,775
So I was outside.

575
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,740
And I saw this thing,

576
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,880
this really super-tall
dark shadow man, like,

577
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:42,120
probably 30 feet tall
just glide,

578
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:45,385
like, across the yard

579
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,995
and then went
into the basement.

580
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,600
And I saw just
all these shadow people.

581
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,565
They were
kind of human size.

582
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,540
I think that the living
might be able to see them.

583
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:00,605
And they
didn't honestly seem

584
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,360
at all interested
in living people.

585
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:08,080
But you never know,
that could change.

586
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:11,250
Well, Cindy's seen them outside.

587
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:14,480
There were, like, 8 to 10

588
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,920
just solid black mass figures
facing the house.

589
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:22,642
And one by one,
they just turned around

590
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,330
and walked right back down
to the river.

591
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,647
Scared me half to death.

592
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,930
I saw them three times.

593
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,505
Um, each time, it was when

594
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,600
I was walking past
Zoey's room.

595
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,410
The third time, I got angry
and just stared at it.

596
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,280
And that thing
didn't back down from me.

597
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,845
It kept staring.

598
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,250
Finally, I just got so scared,
I walked away.

599
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,920
So what else?

600
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,560
Then I went into
the master bedroom.

601
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,082
- That's Cindy's room.
- Okay.

602
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:02,535
And I saw
somebody crying.

603
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,000
And they were scared
and hysterical,

604
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,270
under a ton of stress.

605
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah. I've shed my fair share
of tears here

606
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,410
and just been moments
of just true despair.

607
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,950
I also got that
the individual there,

608
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,555
does get sick a lot.

609
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,590
And that person sees
a lot of strange things.

610
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,330
Um, and the reason
why is because

611
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,182
when I went
into the closet,

612
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:37,593
I saw this
dark, black hole.

613
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,935
I really got evil
from it.

614
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,240
And I said that it was
the Satanic vortex.

615
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,577
I hate that closet.

616
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:51,896
I hate that closet.

617
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:55,180
I hear women screaming.

618
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,220
And it sounds like
it's coming from that closet.

619
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,455
Tell her about
your illnesses as well.

620
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,130
I've had several back surgeries
and a hip surgery.

621
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:09,770
I have had maybe six or eight
other procedures

622
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,165
since we've been here.

623
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,835
- What?
- I just can't heal.

624
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,895
I'm just exhausted
and anxious and depressed.

625
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:25,920
And I'm just fighting
to get my life back

626
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,985
after these injuries.

627
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,990
But at the same time, you don't
want to give up the house.

628
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,907
I love this house.

629
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,755
I got three steps in.

630
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,760
And I knew that we were
supposed to be here.

631
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,260
Interesting.

632
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,405
In the master bedroom,

633
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,310
I also saw a person
in the bed terrified.

634
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,670
You talking 'bout Cindy?

635
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,545
Yes.

636
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,400
There were all
of these dead people,

637
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:59,092
that were kind of
around the bed.

638
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,750
So what did this look
like to you?

639
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,320
I had a sketch done.

640
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,420
I don't know
if I want to even open this up.

641
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,940
There you go.

642
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:20,800
My God.

643
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,440
Wow.
Well, that's awful.

644
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,380
Knowing that they're
targeting my mom,

645
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:35,790
I mean, I just get angry.

646
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:38,290
It's overwhelming.

647
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,060
Did you see anything else?

648
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,460
Yes.

649
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:55,040
I met a dead male that is
very active in this house.

650
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,740
And he is
a serious problem.

651
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,905
He grabbed my arm

652
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,010
and was pinching
through both of the bones.

653
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,050
And it felt like an ice pick
going right through there.

654
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,822
He absolutely did
not want me here.

655
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,560
And I felt he could do
physical harm

656
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:16,155
to living people --

657
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,590
pushing, shoving,
hitting them.

658
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,930
And I think
he could be dangerous.

659
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,570
Well, dangerous is
an understatement.

660
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,905
You could've been killed.

661
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,270
I was coming down
the stairway.

662
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,445
All of a sudden, it felt like
somebody took their arm

663
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,610
and just knocked my legs
right up from underneath me.

664
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:41,080
And I went down,
I mean, hard.

665
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,620
Does that sound like this --
this scum bag would do that?

666
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,825
Yeah.

667
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,220
All right.

668
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,790
So did you get anything
on this guy when he was alive?

669
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:51,625
I saw
he was a white male.

670
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,030
I think he was
in maybe his 40s.

671
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,665
The other thing that I got

672
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,240
was that he had murdered
a woman.

673
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,175
I saw her briefly.

674
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,070
And she was
in a complete panic.

675
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,175
She was screaming.

676
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,360
She was wearing
a white dress,

677
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,510
dark hair,
she looked young.

678
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,845
She was petite.

679
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,820
And she wasn't
wearing any shoes.

680
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:17,150
And it was hot
and sticky.

681
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,420
Then I saw that she was
bashed in the head.

682
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,625
And then
her head exploded.

683
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,360
And I just saw the brain
and hair

684
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,195
and everything
just go,

685
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,250
Then I walked
in the kitchen.

686
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,235
And she jumped
into my body.

687
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,040
The pain was
absolutely excruciating.

688
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,870
In the last 120 years,

689
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,505
there's only been three women

690
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,775
that have been murdered
in this town.

691
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,150
One of them was right next door.
And it happened in 1889.

692
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,580
The victim was
a 13-year-old girl

693
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:47,185
named, Cora Grimes.

694
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,650
And she was a beautiful girl,
dark hair, dark eyes.

695
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,425
Now, the year before
she was murdered,

696
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,060
the parents had hired
a farmhand named Eugene Emory.

697
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,947
The guy became
obsessed with her.

698
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,800
The guy was basically
a pedophile.

699
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:02,465
She's 13. He's 39.

700
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
You said the murder
probably happened

701
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,565
when it was sticky and hot?

702
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,670
Well, the murder took place
on June 24, 1889,

703
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,875
so the hot time of the year.

704
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,005
Now, Cora's parents
left for a bit.

705
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,180
Emory approached Cora
and professed his love to her.

706
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,450
She said to him,
"You're too old for me,"

707
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:20,517
and turned her back on him.

708
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,515
And this guy went into a rage.

709
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,225
He picked up
a club-sized piece of firewood

710
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,560
and took a shot at her head
and cracked her skull open.

711
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:33,527
He wound up turning himself in.

712
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:35,460
And, he ended up confessing.

713
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,500
He basically said
he lost his mind over the girl

714
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,605
and can't explain
why he killed her.

715
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,940
Um, he ended up getting a life
sentence and dying in prison.

716
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,040
Now, we don't have
a photo of him.

717
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,110
But I did track down the sketch
somebody did in the courtroom.

718
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,580
Um, I mean, it's a sketch,
but...

719
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,360
...is it possible that's
the guy you might've seen?

720
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,725
I don't know.
Possible.

721
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,580
It's hard to tell
from that picture.

722
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:08,992
But the case
sounds very similar.

723
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:11,335
Everybody just says
I look so young,

724
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,470
which is still creeping me out
that he's in this house.

725
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,870
Anything else?

726
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,310
When I went into
the living room,

727
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,310
I saw
two teenage males.

728
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,515
They're a big problem.
They're here.

729
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,285
And I keep going back
and forth on, like,

730
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,020
are they really these kids
or are they demons?

731
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,830
Their little mission
is to create this havoc --

732
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,797
torture people,
scare people.

733
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:42,601
And they can influence
the living

734
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,370
to harm themselves
or others.

735
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,200
How would they get here?

736
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,970
The freaking vortex.

737
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,910
Now, you had mentioned
that they can cause people

738
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:56,375
to harm themselves and others.

739
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,315
There was a suicide on the
property you should know about.

740
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,220
This place was built by a guy
named Zachariah Spencer.

741
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,150
Come 1843,

742
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,890
Zachariah turned his whole
business over to his son Henry.

743
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,577
Two years after taking
over the business, 1845,

744
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,230
Henry killed himself
right on the property here.

745
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,330
Boy.

746
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't even want to ask her
if there's anything else.

747
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:21,135
But did you see anything else?

748
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:27,580
The room that I am
extremely nervous about

749
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:30,832
is the blue room.

750
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:34,015
Which is Zoey's room.

751
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,620
Now, you sleep in Zoey's room?

752
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,450
Yeah.

753
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,460
I don't sleep in the master
bedroom anymore.

754
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:43,090
So does Zoey sleep
in there with you?

755
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:46,297
- No.
- She never did.

756
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:49,435
Got it. Okay.
Interesting.

757
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,300
The individual that
sleeps in that room

758
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:59,480
is someone who is
in grave danger.

759
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:01,775
Those specific dead

760
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,010
are very focused
on that living person.

761
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,890
So what the hell
do they want from Cindy?

762
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:12,822
You've been subject
to that room

763
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,720
where that horrible
vortex thing is.

764
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,290
And they followed you.

765
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,405
I think that they are
trying to possess you.

766
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,340
I mean, they can jump you
and mold you into a killer.

767
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,110
My gosh.

768
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,620
They're probably
trying to get you

769
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:42,237
as close to death
as possible

770
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:44,820
'cause that would be
the easiest,

771
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,142
time for them.

772
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,395
That's scary.

773
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,830
Goodness.
I wasn't expecting that.

774
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,255
So, Kelsey,
you called us in

775
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,060
'cause you're worried
about your kids.

776
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,330
But it turns out,
your mother's

777
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:16,725
the one that's in danger.

778
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,460
To see if there's any way
you guys can stay here safely,

779
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,230
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

780
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,040
It just isn't
the right place.

781
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:36,045
My goodness.

782
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,920
And I think, honestly,
as quickly as possible,

783
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:41,190
you need to get out
of the house.

784
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,225
And once you leave,

785
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,060
you then also need
to go for an exorcism.

786
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,700
Once that's done,
all the attachments will go away

787
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,300
so there'll be no more desire
to return

788
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,372
and things like that.

789
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:02,375
As far as this location,

790
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,180
I don't think anyone alive
should live here.

791
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,880
Kind of figured
something like that

792
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,790
was gonna be
what the outcome was.

793
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:19,290
Well, I wasn't.

794
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,895
I love this house.

795
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,135
You might feel differently

796
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,740
once you're away
for a few months

797
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:34,275
after you have
your exorcism.

798
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,570
If she gets the exorcism
done right...

799
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,410
...do you think she'll start
to heal a little bit better?

800
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:41,210
Yeah.
Once you leave the location

801
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:43,045
and you have the exorcism,

802
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,985
I think you'll see
a dramatic change --

803
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,890
your emotional state,
your mental state,

804
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:50,757
your physical state.

805
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,590
And if they stay?

806
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,295
I just...

807
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,390
That's just not
an option to me.

808
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,995
I'm sorry.
But it's just not.

809
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,060
Um, absolutely would
not recommend that.

810
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,520
Well, I'm a little concerned
about you, though.

811
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:06,970
I know what she's saying
that you need to do.

812
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,970
But I'm wondering
if you're like,

813
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,380
"I'm not giving up this house."

814
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,645
No, I'm going.

815
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,350
No ifs,
ands or buts about it.

816
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:18,380
- Okay.
- Yep.

817
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:19,815
Yeah.

818
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,350
This is so much bigger
than what I thought.

819
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,555
No house is worth this.
- No.

820
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,530
I just didn't realize how
big of a nightmare we were in.

821
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,600
The only way Cindy and
Kelsey can save their family

822
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:37,435
is to move as far away
as possible.

823
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,300
If they do that and get
an exorcism for Cindy,

824
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,870
all of the attachments
to the dead will be broken.

825
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,610
And they can begin to lead
a peaceful life.
