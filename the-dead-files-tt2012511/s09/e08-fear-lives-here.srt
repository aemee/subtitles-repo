1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
Everything was built on blood.

2
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:17,105
I seen a shadow run
towards the bathroom.

3
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:20,275
It's almost like a joint poltergeist.

4
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,811
They just keep beating each other.

5
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,613
They were chasing geese across the pond

6
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,047
and ended up drowning.

7
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:29,851
The attacks become more violent.

8
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:33,355
I'm hearing, like,
"Get out of the house."

9
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,857
The blood is still flowing.

10
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,261
Good energy stops right here.

11
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:41,163
I just hear death.

12
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,131
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,766
God.

14
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,635
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

15
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:49,137
I see dead people. Her
face was all demonic.

16
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:51,106
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,741
He's like, "You think you can stop me?

18
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,709
Because you can't."
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,778
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,681
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real...

21
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:01,583
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam.

22
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,185
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:04,686
I'm Steve di Schiavi.

24
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,555
I'm retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:07,823
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

26
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,526
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

27
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:13,929
They everywhere. It's
my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:16,865
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

29
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,700
But Steve and I never speak.

30
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,769
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,937
Until the very end.

32
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,572
Is this Sted guy doing that to her?

33
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:25,841
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,275
That's it.

35
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,678
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,713
Somebody's gonna die over there soon.

37
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,481
Yeah.

38
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:51,166
I'm in the city of Magna, Utah
just west of Salt Lake City.

39
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:52,934
Now, I took this case for two reasons.

40
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:55,503
First, the woman who called us in.

41
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,106
She was crying on the phone
and sounded really scared.

42
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,942
Second, there are kids
involved, three of them.

43
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,310
And according to their mom

44
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:04,512
they are being physically
and psychologically attacked

45
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:06,147
by whatever's in that house.

46
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,553
Before Amy arrives
I throw the house

47
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:13,622
of any leading information.

48
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,690
Family photographs and
other personal items

49
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:17,692
can influence her findings

50
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,595
so it's important I
cover or remove them all.

51
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:22,397
When I'm finished the
location will be ready

52
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,132
for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:39,681
Good energy is not
making it into this home.

54
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:41,983
Good energy stops right here.

55
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,358
Unfortunately the people

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,629
who've moved into this place,

57
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,932
have not been very stable.

58
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:58,266
And because of all of

59
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:02,737
that they're pulling
in this negative energy.

60
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,840
The dead are attracted to this location

61
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:09,544
because of all the drama and craziness.

62
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:12,614
I feel really horrible,
sick, sick, sick.

63
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,889
So, Jennie,

64
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:24,592
when we spoke on the phone
you sounded really upset.

65
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:28,129
The reason I took this case is
because it involved children.

66
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,564
- Yes.
- Your kids are going through

67
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:32,567
- a rough time here?
- Yes, late nights with the kids.

68
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,302
They are not sleeping in their rooms,

69
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:35,737
they're staying up.

70
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,507
And once I really started seeing
my kids go through things...

71
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,910
- Right.
- That's when it's hard.

72
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,945
Especially for my youngest.

73
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:45,213
She is, like, so scared.

74
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,315
She tries running out of the house.

75
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:51,219
And so that's when you, like,
don't know what to do anymore.

76
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,688
It's not anything any kid
should have to go through.

77
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,725
No, especially when you can't
explain anything to them.

78
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:58,727
Like, when they ask,
you know, why or what.

79
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:02,197
And it's like you don't have
really anything for them.

80
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,365
All right.

81
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,300
So who exactly lives
in the house with you?

82
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:07,268
That's all of us.

83
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,837
All right. So who's here?

84
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,373
This is Lexie, she's 11.

85
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,708
And that's Summer, she's 7.

86
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,144
- Okay.
- And then that's me.

87
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,513
That's my son Zeke. He's 12.

88
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,049
- Okay.
- And then my husband.

89
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,151
- Okay.
- And he's 30.

90
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,953
And then, that's my mom.

91
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,955
So Jennie, has your mom
always lived with you?

92
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:29,391
No, we moved her in

93
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,459
because she was having
some surgeries done.

94
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,894
What kind of surgeries?

95
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,097
She's had to have some surgeries
to remove her brain tumor.

96
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,366
- Really?
- This one was cancer,

97
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,868
- like a stage two.
- Okay.

98
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,103
So she's had to go through radiation.

99
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,472
It kinda did a number on her this time.

100
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:47,642
She still gets really
bad headaches sometimes.

101
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:53,982
I don't like this.

102
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,450
Headaches.

103
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:58,353
Constant headaches, headaches,
headaches, headaches, headaches,

104
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:00,455
stress, stress.

105
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:03,958
Constant stress and headaches.

106
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:09,798
There's abuse.

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,803
I think it was some time ago.

108
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:16,171
This person... This is,

109
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:20,508
like, a safe haven to
get away from everything.

110
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,912
But there is no really
getting away from everything.

111
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:28,817
Being in here makes it worse.

112
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,218
How long have you guys been living here?

113
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,753
Since 2008.

114
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,588
It was a beautiful house, you know,

115
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,457
somewhere nice to raise the kids.

116
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,792
So, Jennie, do you know
any history on the property?

117
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,427
- Anything?
- Not a lot except for

118
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,029
that it's a mining town.

119
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,263
- A mining town?
- Yeah.

120
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,832
That's interesting to know. Okay.

121
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,101
Any idea what kind of...
what they're mining here?

122
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:47,202
It might be copper.

123
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,403
Okay. All right, Jennie.

124
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,038
So do me a favor and give
me a list of the things

125
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,606
you guys are experiencing.

126
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,741
Bangs, voices

127
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,577
and now things are moving.

128
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,646
And we see dark shadows.

129
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,216
And now it's gotten physical.

130
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,717
Okay. Physical with who?

131
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,185
My daughter Lexie.

132
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,621
She got scratched.

133
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:08,022
That's gotta be killing you.

134
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:11,292
She's so scared that
something's gonna hurt her.

135
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,995
That's the hardest part.

136
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:15,563
I don't get a lot of sleep.

137
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:18,133
We do a lot of camping
out in the living room.

138
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,934
Have you guys done
anything to be proactive?

139
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,436
Like, have you had the house blessed?

140
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,438
- Have you done anything?
- Um, we've tried

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,672
blessing it ourselves.

142
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:27,008
We went and burned sage
through the house...

143
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,110
- Okay.
- And, you know, salt.

144
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,445
Did it work?

145
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:32,714
No, it actually got a lot worse.

146
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:41,856
Somebody did something out here.

147
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:45,160
Some kind of protection thing.

148
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,628
But it's wrong.

149
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,563
It wasn't done right.

150
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:54,569
It pushed all the bad,
icky **** inside.

151
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:58,840
It created this, like, suction
thing that's sucking in,

152
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:02,577
crazy ****.

153
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,246
And it's keeping good stuff out.

154
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:14,622
So, Jennie, why'd you take
me into the master bedroom?

155
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:18,793
This is where, um, I have experiences.

156
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,829
One night, I got woken up to the sheets

157
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,398
being moved off of me and,

158
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,568
like, somebody just touching
me, like, rubbing my shoulder.

159
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,902
Now is there any way possible

160
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:29,204
that your husband coulda
been strokin' your arm?

161
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:32,740
Um, no, he was sleeping
facing towards the window.

162
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:34,008
Okay, physically he
couldn't have done it.

163
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,677
No.

164
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,878
Anything else?

165
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,846
- I will just be laying in bed...
- Okay.

166
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,748
And I will get woken up by a humming

167
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,717
- electric sound.
- Okay.

168
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,085
And then all of a sudden these shadows

169
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,987
will come from over there,

170
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:47,388
from my dresser, and,

171
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,290
like, they will slowly
start moving into me.

172
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,226
And they're darker shadows.

173
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,994
And you can hear them whispering.

174
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,196
And so I'm just frozen there with them

175
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,898
just standing over me.

176
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,932
You must freak out
when you see this thing.

177
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,434
I do. One time

178
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,169
I said, "Okay, just take me."

179
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,604
Like, I'm in full blown panic.

180
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,905
So, like, your heart's racing...

181
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,173
- Right.
- You're sweating,

182
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,908
but I can't move, I can't talk.

183
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,950
I see a woman.

184
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:20,321
She looks like late thirties.

185
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:25,927
And she is alive, crying.

186
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,564
And she feels very lonely.

187
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:32,800
She feels like she's been deserted.

188
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,402
A lot of despair.

189
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:39,007
I saw a younger male.

190
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,576
He's a mess. He's a mess.

191
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,079
He's done a lot of really bad things

192
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,081
in his life.

193
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,117
I think he's a addict.

194
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,387
He's done just terrible things.

195
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,422
And I don't know if he lives here

196
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:55,857
or if he lived here.

197
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,992
But I definitely got

198
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:03,131
that he left a lot of energy behind.

199
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,300
And there was something about guns.

200
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,640
Seems like Jennie is
having a rough time.

201
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:14,742
- Are you?
- Yes.

202
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:16,778
Tell me about the
experiences you've had.

203
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,346
I was walkin' into my room.

204
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,415
I seen clothes swinging

205
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:23,217
and a shadow run towards the bathroom.

206
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,285
At the same time?

207
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,120
- At the same time.
- And you're sure

208
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:27,755
it wasn't one of the kids
running through the bed room?

209
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,857
No, they were all in school.

210
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:31,359
Okay, anything else?

211
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,794
I walked into the laundry room

212
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:34,329
and there was somebody standing there.

213
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,897
I asked him, "Who are you?

214
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,332
What are you doing here?"

215
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:40,902
He just stood there, blank
stare at me and then gone.

216
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,670
He just vanished.

217
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,172
Okay, describe him to me.

218
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,740
Complete black.

219
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,609
Couldn't make out a face or anything.

220
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:49,811
How do you explain it?

221
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:52,213
- I can't figure it out.
- Okay.

222
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:53,481
That must've scared the hell outta you.

223
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:56,417
It scares the ****
out of me is what it does.

224
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,590
Somebody was in here.

225
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:08,796
A living person felt their
hairs stand up, turned,

226
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:13,067
saw a shadow figure move.

227
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:19,974
More than once they've
seen this, more than once.

228
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,442
The drug addict guy

229
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:24,312
is projecting himself
as the shadow figure.

230
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,718
This is a... not good place.

231
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,440
Let me ask you a
question. How old are you?

232
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:57,108
- I'm 12.
- Twelve.

233
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,510
So, Zeke, tell me about
what you're seeing.

234
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:01,379
A green guy.

235
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,580
He comes through the wall

236
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,882
and first you hear a big old bang

237
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,785
and then I wake up and I see him.

238
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:10,054
- And it's coming from that wall.
- Here?

239
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:12,290
- Yep.
- All right.

240
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,758
You're 12. All right.

241
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Are you fooling around taking
any of mommy and daddy's pills

242
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,395
or anything like that?

243
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:18,996
- No.
- All right.

244
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,265
So you're not hallucinating
when you're seeing this stuff?

245
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,533
No.

246
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,836
Are you... are you hearing
or seeing anything else?

247
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:30,041
I'm seeing a guy with a hat.

248
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:31,209
Okay.

249
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,412
Comes up through my

250
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:38,983
ceiling in my closet.

251
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,285
Okay, can you see any
features on this thing?

252
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,522
- No, just the hat.
- All right. So, anything else?

253
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:50,394
Um, I've heard the chairs
moving and the table moving.

254
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:51,963
Where? In...
in the kitchen?

255
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,298
- Yeah.
- Okay, so when you heard it move

256
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
did you go out there and check it out?

257
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,201
- Yeah.
- And what'd you see?

258
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:01,105
Nothing, I looked just as normal.

259
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,174
The stuff you're seeing is
pretty wild for an adult to see.

260
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,344
Um, you realize this is not
normal for a 12 year old?

261
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,079
Yeah.

262
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:15,153
Everybody who's alive in the house, um,

263
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,155
is like beating on each other.

264
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:20,758
It's almost, like, a joint,

265
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,428
like, poltergeist from all these people.

266
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,366
They're, like, literally taking ****

267
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,369
Down on one another
via this poltergeist.

268
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:32,737
I know they're seeing things

269
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:37,141
but I can't quite see
what they're seeing.

270
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,215
I don't know what's going
on with the... the ceiling.

271
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,290
I'm feeling like a lot
of physical assaults here,

272
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:56,194
and this is from living
people to other living people.

273
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:59,230
It's just a **** mess.

274
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,406
So, Summer, tell me,
honey, how old are you?

275
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,741
- Seven.
- So, Summer, I understand

276
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:14,579
that you sleep out here most
of the time, is that right?

277
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay, because you're
afraid of your room?

278
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:21,252
Okay, do you ever seen anything
when you're sleeping out here?

279
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,855
Yeah. I see people.

280
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:27,358
I... I think they
are trying to hurt me.

281
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,726
All right, where do you see them?

282
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:32,396
In my room, in the
kitchen and the bathroom.

283
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:35,032
Okay, what else are
you hearing or seeing?

284
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,004
I freak out.

285
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,807
My parents come upstairs
and they check on me

286
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,142
and I wake everybody up.

287
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,412
- Okay.
- And I was like,

288
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:49,847
"Call the cops."

289
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:52,316
You're scared of this place, honey?

290
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,618
Yeah.

291
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,853
Well, we're here to try
to get rid of everything.

292
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,123
Would you like to go sleep
in your own room again?

293
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,858
Okay.

294
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,330
I would think that the living here

295
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:07,999
are experiencing things

296
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,134
like, you know, feeling slapped,

297
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:14,071
headaches, panic attacks
for sure, anxiety,

298
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:17,308
punched, kicked,

299
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,811
possible sexual assaults...

300
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:27,018
Very weird. It's weird.

301
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,929
How old are you, honey?

302
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,697
- I'm 11.
- Okay.

303
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,167
So when I talked to mom, um,
she called us in basically

304
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:44,669
because the stuff you're going through.

305
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:45,736
Yeah.

306
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:47,805
- Is that upsetting you?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,408
So I understand you've been
having some experiences.

308
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,542
Yeah.

309
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,010
Okay, can you mind
telling me about them?

310
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,913
Um, I went upstairs.

311
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:59,984
And I heard my door close,

312
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,986
and then open and then close.

313
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,221
And it went on and on and on.

314
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:07,258
- Which door is this?
- It was that door.

315
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,793
Okay, did you see it open and closing?

316
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,227
Yes.

317
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,330
Yes, but could the window
have been open in the bedroom

318
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:13,831
that caused the door to open and shut?

319
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,299
My dad came in and checked it out

320
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:17,101
- and there was nothing in here.
- Nothing here.

321
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,703
Okay, have you seen
or heard anything else?

322
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:24,108
My dresser and my TV
they were both rocking.

323
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,178
The dresser started going up and down?

324
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,646
No, it started like...

325
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:29,680
Teetering back and forth?

326
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,549
Yeah.

327
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,750
The whole dresser itself?

328
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:33,985
Yeah.

329
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,219
Did you guys think you
were having a earthquake

330
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,620
or something?

331
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:40,291
No, because I didn't see
anything else shaking and...

332
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:41,325
So it was just these two things?

333
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,361
It was just those two things.

334
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:45,029
All right. So anything else, honey?

335
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:50,968
I got scratched right over here.

336
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,870
I was laying in my bed

337
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:55,873
and my arm was hanging out like that.

338
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,243
And then there was, like,
a little... like that.

339
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:02,546
So this is a silly question
but are you scared to be here?

340
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:06,083
I'm really scared to be here.

341
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,719
Okay.

342
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,455
I'm seeing, like, a teenage girl.

343
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,557
Everybody's being affected.

344
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,593
But it's almost like...
like she's really getting,

345
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,928
like, the brunt.

346
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,632
You know what I mean? Like,
she's, like, ground zero.

347
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:25,202
She has a lot of ability.

348
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:28,139
She might be,

349
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:34,178
the biggest source

350
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,481
and doesn't even know
it, doesn't even know it.

351
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:44,488
So what do you think would happen,

352
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,590
if this were to
continue going on

353
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:48,659
and nothing was done about it?

354
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:51,962
I think that the physical attacks

355
00:16:51,964 --> 00:16:56,100
would become more violent,

356
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,902
to where there would be,

357
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,371
um, actual cutting

358
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,374
or scratching involved.

359
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,676
And, possible smothering

360
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,212
or strangulation to occur.

361
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,392
Other than a
family living in fear,

362
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:27,429
I don't have much to go off
of to do my investigation.

363
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:31,733
So I'm at the library to
see if I can dig anything up.

364
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:33,068
Searching through old records,

365
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,636
I find one of the original owners

366
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,973
of my clients property
lost two young kids.

367
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:42,844
Turns out they both
drowned in an accident.

368
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:45,180
I'm on my way to meet
with a local genealogist

369
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,415
who's looking into this tragedy for me.

370
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,284
She tells me the kids
who drowned that day

371
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:52,487
were direct descendants of
a very prominent local man.

372
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,894
So, Christine, before
we get to the drownings

373
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,964
you mentioned that the kids
were related to somebody famous.

374
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:06,034
Yes, the children's grandfather
was Edward Watkins Clark.

375
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:08,169
One of the first Mormon
settlers here in Utah.

376
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,971
Okay. When did this guy come here?

377
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,140
So, in 1852 he finally settled in Utah

378
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,241
with his first wife.

379
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,476
All right. So when Edward gets here

380
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,244
- what does he do?
- He was a farmer.

381
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,113
He was very prominent in the community.

382
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,948
Everyone knew him and his wife, Lucy.

383
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,650
He was actually elected

384
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,752
to justice of the
peace out in Santaquin.

385
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:24,819
Okay, you said his first wife.

386
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,621
Can I assume his first wife died?

387
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:27,889
No, actually the Mormon church

388
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:30,225
encouraged polygamy at this time.

389
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,260
And so he was encouraged
to take other wives.

390
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:35,130
And in 1857 he married his
second wife, Louisa Miller,

391
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:36,431
who was 20 years his junior.

392
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,466
She was only 17 when they got married.

393
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:39,668
Seventeen?

394
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,203
I have a picture of
her when she's older.

395
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,772
Now does he have kids with both of them?

396
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,640
- Yes, 18.
- Wow.

397
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,075
He had 10 with his first wife, Lucy,

398
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,311
and eight with his second wife, Louisa.

399
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:50,879
The second youngest is John Edward,

400
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,814
who is the father of
the children who died.

401
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:55,350
Okay.

402
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,618
I'm seeing this woman

403
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,323
and she's married to a much older male.

404
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:04,893
She was probably in her late 20s

405
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,162
and he was, like,

406
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,431
between 60 and 70 years of age.

407
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,500
He was prestigious.

408
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,837
He was a big time business man.

409
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,940
He kept fighting me because
he doesn't want me here.

410
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:23,812
He doesn't want anything
about him or his family out.

411
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,952
He wants to keep his
private life secret.

412
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:33,922
And then
there's a...

413
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,957
a... a younger female.

414
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,593
And I don't know if
it's his step-daughter

415
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:43,898
or if it's his biological daughter.

416
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,105
The girl doesn't look like
either one of them at all.

417
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,241
The daughter is like 16 or something.

418
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:57,312
Um, and he was having an
inappropriate relationship

419
00:19:57,314 --> 00:19:58,646
with her

420
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:02,150
and also very abusive and controlling.

421
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:05,887
I guess you would wanna keep that quiet.

422
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,522
So I know Edward's son, John,

423
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,023
owned my clients' property at one point.

424
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,592
Do you know when that was?

425
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:13,461
1923 is when he bought
the property out in Magna.

426
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,498
Okay, so now how many kids did he have?

427
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,832
He had eight children in total.

428
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,101
He had three girls and five little boys.

429
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,803
Okay, so take me through
the day of the accident.

430
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,039
- What happened?
- İt was January 2, 1926.

431
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,509
It was a day a lot like
today where the sun is out

432
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,110
and all the snow is on the ground

433
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,746
and the pond probably looked
a lot like this, very frozen.

434
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,848
Three of the little boys, Floydd,

435
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,051
Morris and Lennis, all take
their friend Clarence out.

436
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,387
And they were chasing
geese across the pond

437
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:41,523
but it was too thin and
all the boys fell through.

438
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,824
Wow.

439
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,226
And Clarence was able to
help Floydd out of the water

440
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,929
but Morris and Lennis ended up drowning.

441
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,197
I have their death certificates.

442
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:52,233
So this is Morris Ruden,

443
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,468
and his death certificate even says,

444
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,070
"Accidental drowning." Okay.

445
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:59,274
And then Lennis Dean, same thing.

446
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,675
All right, so they lost
two kids to drowning.

447
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,178
Tragic. I mean, I can't
even imagine losing one

448
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,579
- let alone two.
- Yeah.

449
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,114
So what happened
with... with John?

450
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:07,682
I mean, did him and
his wife stick around

451
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,983
- after this happened?
- They did.

452
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,685
John actually did not
release the property

453
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,421
until 1953 is when he sold it actually

454
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:16,991
a few months before he died,
when his heart collapsed.

455
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,327
Okay.

456
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:23,431
I do see a different house,
that was here prior.

457
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:28,536
This house took up
several acres of property.

458
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:34,175
I'm hearing a woman
screaming and crying.

459
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:37,745
And it's over a death.

460
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,481
She's outside.

461
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,021
It might be in the
backyard or something.

462
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:51,860
This person couldn't get over it.

463
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,127
can't...

464
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:56,264
can't get over it.

465
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:57,499
She's like, "Why?

466
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,267
Why?"

467
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,171
Very dramatic.

468
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,440
Like, her hands are up, like, "Why?

469
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:10,245
Why? Why? No, no, no."

470
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:17,719
If you need us to investigate

471
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:19,621
unexplained activity in your home

472
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:22,657
go to the Dead Files
page at travelchannel.com.

473
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:24,125
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files" to submit your story.

474
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:25,260
And we'll help if we can.

475
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,217
Jennie told me she thought there used

476
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,319
to be a lot of copper
mining in the area.

477
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,189
So I made some calls and
it turns out she's right.

478
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,058
I'm meeting a historian who
says mining killed two men

479
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,027
who live on my clients' land.

480
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:54,169
So, Robert, what can you tell
me about the mining industry

481
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:55,437
in Magna?

482
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,540
Well Magna actually started
out as a farming community.

483
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,009
- Okay.
- But it wasn't until 1906

484
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,211
that the Utah Copper
Company brought in the...

485
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,680
the biggest, refining

486
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:08,617
and smelting, operation
in world history at the time.

487
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,488
Millions of tons of ore was
being processed every year.

488
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,923
So it's basically all copper?

489
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,891
Mostly copper, that's
what they're renowned for.

490
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,726
You can talk about a real
dangerous work environment.

491
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:20,596
It was very dangerous,
very toxic environment.

492
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:22,698
- Okay.
- A lot of sulfuric emissions,

493
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,833
heavy metal particulates
and even asbestos.

494
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:27,136
So the odds are stacked against you.

495
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,371
So you had mentioned on
the phone, two guys

496
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:30,839
that lived on my clients' property,

497
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:33,309
died in connection with the mining.

498
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,710
Tell me about the first guy.

499
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,545
First guys name is Wallace Anderson.

500
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,480
- Okay.
- He bought your clients' property

501
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:39,982
in 1936.

502
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:41,083
So what happened to him?

503
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,053
Well, by 1944 it catches up to him.

504
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,754
He's in your clients' house.

505
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,389
He's feeling pain in his lungs.

506
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,591
He's having trouble breathing.

507
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,492
He checks himself into the hospital.

508
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:51,894
He's there for 12 days.

509
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,295
And he dies.

510
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,331
Okay, so what's the
official cause of death?

511
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,333
It's bronchogenic carcinoma.

512
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,936
It's lung cancer.

513
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:03,639
Pretty common way to go
for mine workers back then.

514
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:04,907
It was.

515
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,008
Now, Robert, you mentioned
there was a second guy

516
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,843
that died on my clients' property.

517
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,011
Right. Who, who was that?

518
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:12,214
His name was Paul William Confer.

519
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,183
He was actually renting the property

520
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:15,951
from Wallace's widow.

521
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:17,519
Okay, so what happened?

522
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:19,254
In 1948, he goes down

523
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:21,490
inside the mine in a blasting team

524
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:23,125
- with another fella...
- Okay.

525
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,060
And they never came out
with the other groups.

526
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:26,562
And so they sent a
search party down there

527
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,130
and discovered that they'd been killed.

528
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,498
They were killed in an explosion.

529
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,634
And here's his death certificate.

530
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,702
Subtotal decapitation,

531
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:36,839
amputation both arms,
puncture wounds both legs.

532
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:39,274
Did they ever figure out
what caused the explosion?

533
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:42,177
- Either a faulty fuse...
- Okay.

534
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,380
Or it was negligence on
the part of the miners.

535
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,016
Geez. Are the mines still going on?

536
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,118
Yeah. The mine is still running today.

537
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,253
So I'm assuming it's a
cleaner operation today?

538
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,055
It is. In 1994 the EPA

539
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:56,959
stepped in and declared Magna
an environmental disaster zone.

540
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,862
After 100 years of industry,

541
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,697
the water was contaminated.

542
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,465
The soil was contaminated.

543
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,334
What kinds of effects
could that have on somebody?

544
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,569
Today still the lung cancer rate

545
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,039
is 50 percent greater
than the rest of the state.

546
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,408
And not only cancer but high rates

547
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,877
of ADD, autism, delirium

548
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,845
and even hallucinations.

549
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,715
Really? That's interesting.

550
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,388
There's a lot of residual energy here.

551
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,957
I saw on the land

552
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,728
that everything was built on blood.

553
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,931
And I see the blood is still flowing.

554
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:42,304
And they said it was built
and blood and dirty dealings

555
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:47,242
and that both of those things
are still happening today.

556
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,878
And that's why the
blood is still flowing.

557
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:54,249
This is a not good place.

558
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:03,492
Look, if contaminated water
can cause hallucinations

559
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,761
it could explain some of
the really strange things

560
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,763
Jennie and her family are seeing.

561
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,631
I'm heading back to the
house to meet an inspector

562
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:13,335
who's going to give the water
a thorough, scientific test.

563
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,844
- Hey, Jonathan.
- How's it goin'?

564
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,178
Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.

565
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,346
Yeah. You bet.

566
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,814
The reason I called
you out is my clients

567
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:28,217
that live in this
house, they're telling me

568
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,052
that they're seeing
some really off the wall,

569
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,320
bizarre stuff.

570
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,088
Now I know this place
in '94 was considered

571
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,457
- a EPA disaster area.
- That's correct.

572
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,092
I mean, all along the Wasatch Front

573
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:39,027
we see a number of locations

574
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,164
that have had some kind of
environmental hazards,

575
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,100
primarily due to the proximity
of local mines in the area.

576
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:46,301
Now, could you test to see

577
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,470
if there's any kind of
environmental problem

578
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,472
that could cause these
people to have hallucinations?

579
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:51,573
Yeah. Absolutely.

580
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,442
Okay, good. Let me know what you find.

581
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:55,210
Will do.

582
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,682
I've clients seeing
things moving on their own

583
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:03,118
and green men coming out of the walls

584
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,420
which means there are
three possibilities.

585
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:06,755
One, they're lying to me.

586
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:09,191
But I don't think that's the case.

587
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:10,459
Two, their soil

588
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,395
or water is contaminated
causing them to hallucinate.

589
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,898
Or three, there's something
going on that only Amy

590
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,899
can understand.

591
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,700
So, how'd it go?

592
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,269
Well we tested the soil,

593
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,337
the water as well as
the paint on the walls

594
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:24,072
and we didn't find any contaminants.

595
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:25,140
Really?

596
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:26,542
So there's no environmental reason

597
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,210
why clients are seeing what
the hell they're seeing?

598
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:30,379
- No.
- Okay.

599
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:32,147
So now I know what it's not.

600
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,825
I saw a lot of disturbing activity

601
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,959
during my walk.

602
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,028
But the drug addict who projects himself

603
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,697
as the shadow figure really stood out.

604
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:49,731
He was young,

605
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:53,769
I would say between 18 and 24.

606
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:58,540
He had a very narrow, nose.

607
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:02,411
He also had very dark eyes, kinda black.

608
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,187
Is this who you saw?

609
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:13,622
Yes.

610
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,068
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

611
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,202
we're ready to reveal our findings

612
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:40,138
to each other and our clients

613
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
for the first time.

614
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:44,676
So, Amy, I want you to
meet Randall and Jennie.

615
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:47,779
They're experiencing some pretty
bizarre stuff in their house.

616
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:50,748
But the reason they called us
in is because of their kids.

617
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,951
We got a photo of the family here.

618
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:56,020
Now, this is Lexie, she's 11.

619
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:59,123
This is Summer, she's
an adorable 7-year-old.

620
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,726
This is their Zeke, who's 12.

621
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,128
And this is, Jennie's mom, Debbie,

622
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,329
who lives with them.

623
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:06,998
These guys think that
whatever's in the house

624
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,499
is going after the kids.

625
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:09,734
And they promised me they'll do

626
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:11,669
whatever it takes to keep them safe.

627
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,005
So now that Amy knows a
little bit about your family,

628
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,674
I'm going to, ask
her to describe her walk.

629
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:23,281
Walking up to your
home, to the front door,

630
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:26,084
I saw a male,

631
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:29,120
doing some kind of ritual

632
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:31,756
or protection.

633
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,891
Who ever this was,

634
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:37,395
and whatever he did, was not good.

635
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:42,066
It created a type of negative suction

636
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,634
into your house.

637
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,703
And unfortunately all good energy

638
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:48,806
stops right at your front door.

639
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:50,608
That's weird because I
don't know about a male,

640
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,778
but you mentioned to me
that you guys did something.

641
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,847
Yeah. Me and my
mother-in-law,

642
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,181
we tried to cleanse the house

643
00:29:57,183 --> 00:30:00,118
with, like, sage and salt.

644
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,385
Now she's talking about negativity.

645
00:30:01,387 --> 00:30:02,987
Have you guys felt that in the house?

646
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:04,655
Sometimes when you just
come home it just...

647
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:07,225
just doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel like home.

648
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:10,661
Wow.

649
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:12,797
So what else did you see?

650
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,634
I encountered an elderly deceased male.

651
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:19,470
What he was saying to me
was that when he was alive

652
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,606
he was very prestigious.

653
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,808
He was a big player.

654
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,544
He absolutely did not want me there.

655
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:30,481
What I did get was that
there were two women,

656
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:32,083
of importance in his life.

657
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:34,519
One was his wife.

658
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:38,489
The wife was much younger than him.

659
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,124
She was in her twenties.

660
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:42,693
And then one was a younger girl.

661
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:45,696
And I didn't know if that was
his daughter or step-daughter.

662
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:48,266
And the girl was about 16.

663
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:50,434
And what I did get

664
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:53,271
was that there was an
inappropriate relationship

665
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:56,040
between him and the younger girl.

666
00:30:56,042 --> 00:31:00,545
And I felt like that's what
he was trying to conceal.

667
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:03,481
He's very grouchy, very controlling.

668
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:06,250
And when he is inside of the home

669
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:11,522
the men of the house may take
on these kinds of attitudes.

670
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,025
Well, Jennie, have you noticed
that with Randall or Zeke?

671
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,260
Yeah. Big time.

672
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:17,995
I came across somebody in my research

673
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:19,030
that might fit the bill.

674
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:21,532
His name was Edward Watkins Clark.

675
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,267
You had mentioned he was prestigious.

676
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:26,604
He was a famous pioneer
for the Mormon church.

677
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:29,473
He came over from England in 1852.

678
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:32,176
He brought his wife
Lucy over with his kids.

679
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:33,411
Now you mentioned a teenage girl

680
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,780
that might be his daughter
or a step-daughter.

681
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:40,284
Well back in those days
they preached polygamy.

682
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:41,986
He was 37.

683
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,154
And he married his girl, Louisa,

684
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:46,824
who was, 17 at the time.

685
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,326
Now I got a photo of her

686
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:53,798
but this is from when
she was much older.

687
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,300
Now together with his
two wives he had 18 kids.

688
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:58,936
The 17th child,

689
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:01,873
named John, ended up
living on your property.

690
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:09,113
The next thing that
I saw is a younger male.

691
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:13,384
And I honestly couldn't
tell if he was alive or dead.

692
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:16,821
If he is deceased it
was extremely recent.

693
00:32:16,823 --> 00:32:18,756
He was in the downstairs,

694
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:21,425
large, downstairs bedroom.

695
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:23,461
He was very agitated.

696
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,230
He felt like everybody
was out to get him.

697
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,399
He felt like he was falling apart.

698
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,302
The living, who would
be down there a lot,

699
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:35,273
would feel this sense
of despair or depression.

700
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:38,209
And I think if you were to see him

701
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:40,411
it would be a shadow-like figure.

702
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:42,813
Now, Jennie, you had your own
experiences with shadow figures?

703
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,249
- Yeah.
- Tell her what you told me.

704
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:48,152
And I'll just be right
there, by my dresser,

705
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:49,720
and then he'll come towards me.

706
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:52,189
But then I'm stuck in my
bed. And I'm just frozen.

707
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:57,128
I'm sweating, breathing
hard, just can't do anything.

708
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,096
Randall, didn't you see
another one leering at you

709
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:00,665
at one point?

710
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,134
I asked him, "Who are
you? What do you want?"

711
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:04,936
It just looked at me...

712
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,805
Then gone, just vanished.

713
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:10,141
Did you get anything
about this guy in life?

714
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:14,045
What I got on him
was that he was, I think,

715
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:15,313
in his twenties.

716
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,882
He claimed to have done
a lot of terrible things

717
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:19,483
during his lifetime.

718
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:24,255
I just see him with a
rifle and a small handgun.

719
00:33:24,257 --> 00:33:26,991
And I did get that he was an addict

720
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:29,493
and/or fighting addiction.

721
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,829
I got a sense that he did live here.

722
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,765
And like I said, if he still alive,

723
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:38,235
he essentially left part of himself.

724
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,037
Did you get a good look at him?

725
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,573
- I had a sketch done.
- Okay.

726
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:52,883
Maybe you guys can
tell me if they...

727
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:55,653
he looks like anybody
that you might know.

728
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:03,794
- My brother.
- Yeah.

729
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:06,597
My brother's sittin' in jail right now.

730
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,065
What?

731
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,067
Any issues with guns and
stuff that she's talking about?

732
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,771
Yeah. He...
he loves guns.

733
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:15,439
This is pretty wild.

734
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:16,774
So let me get this straight,

735
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,442
it's possible for somebody

736
00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:21,645
who's not dead to haunt the house?

737
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:25,049
Sometimes people
will really leave a, like,

738
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:28,319
really a part of themselves there.

739
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:30,788
This has gotta be tough
for you to hear though?

740
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,556
Yeah. Very.

741
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,895
So what else?

742
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:39,997
I went into the pink room.

743
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:43,034
And I got a horrible headache.

744
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,735
It was overwhelming.

745
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:48,506
And I felt like a woman
stays there, goes there,

746
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,174
feels like the room is a safe haven

747
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:51,475
to get away from everything.

748
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:53,310
But it's not.

749
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,282
And she keeps feeling
pain from life loss.

750
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:00,684
I got loss, abuse and death.

751
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:02,686
When she's in there, it just

752
00:35:02,688 --> 00:35:06,657
feels like it's all
happening again and again.

753
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,993
Well that's the room where Jennie's mom,

754
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:10,494
Debbie, sleeps.

755
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:13,631
Um, my mom has had a
couple brain surgeries.

756
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,865
Wow.

757
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,935
And the last one was a stage two cancer.

758
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,904
So she does get headaches a lot.

759
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:21,672
So what she's saying kinda makes sense?

760
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:22,773
Yeah.

761
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:26,010
She's been through a lot.

762
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,846
Now'd you see anything else?

763
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:30,714
So the thing I'm most concerned about

764
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:35,019
is the poltergeist
activity in the house.

765
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:39,256
A poltergeist is usually created

766
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,926
by one living agent who has abilities.

767
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:44,862
But in your case it's unusual

768
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:49,066
because you have several people
in your home with abilities.

769
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:51,102
And they're all feeding this poltergeist

770
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:52,636
without even knowing it.

771
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:58,375
And what can happen

772
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:02,913
is that when you get
upset with somebody,

773
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:05,416
the poltergeist will affect that person.

774
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:06,717
So, suddenly, that person will feel

775
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,486
like they're being smacked,

776
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:09,887
pinched, punched,

777
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:12,123
kicked, scratches will appear,

778
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,225
things like that happen.

779
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,694
Also, you'll see strange things.

780
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:21,065
It's a result of this
poltergeist manifestation

781
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:25,102
from somebody in the house.

782
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:27,238
Now, she hit on a lot of things
you guys are experiencing.

783
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,672
Lexie with the scratch.

784
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,474
Tell Amy what happened.

785
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:32,776
We were all getting
ready to leave, you know,

786
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,712
and she's walking down the hall

787
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,815
and all of a sudden
she's just scratched.

788
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:41,852
Tell her about, pretty
wild, there's the door.

789
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:45,322
Lexie was going into
the kitchen to get food.

790
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:46,690
And she was almost to the kitchen

791
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,526
but her bedroom door was sitting
there opening and closing,

792
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:50,694
like, fully opening and closing.

793
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:53,397
You were saying people
might see strange things?

794
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:55,766
Now get this, their son Zeke

795
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:57,893
was telling me some crazy stuff.

796
00:36:57,895 --> 00:37:00,596
I mean, green men
coming outta the walls...

797
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:01,630
Yeah.

798
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,065
Yeah.

799
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,334
Could all this activity
be from the poltergeist?

800
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:08,971
Yes, absolutely.

801
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,306
All right. Now, there's
something you gotta know

802
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,807
about the area that they live in.

803
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,677
It's basically built on
a copper mining business.

804
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,412
1994 the EPA came in

805
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:20,049
and declared the area an
environmental disaster zone.

806
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:22,084
- What?
- Now some of the toxins

807
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,752
in the water can cause hallucinations.

808
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:26,222
So I had everything
checked in your house.

809
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:29,225
I had the soil, the water and paint.

810
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,727
Everything came back negative.

811
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:34,930
Yeah. I think the kids
are creating the strange visions

812
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:36,465
to scare each other.

813
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,033
They're torturing each other.

814
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,071
Do they know they're
doing that to each other?

815
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:44,440
No, I don't think they do.

816
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,041
But it's subconsciously
they're doing it?

817
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:48,177
Yes,

818
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:51,480
The strongest agent in the house,

819
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,182
of this ability

820
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,317
is Lexie.

821
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:56,685
Wow.

822
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,988
I... I don't know... I
don't know what to say.

823
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,589
I knew she was going through a lot

824
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:04,560
but I didn't know it was like that.

825
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:06,595
If this goes unchecked what happens?

826
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:08,931
It'll get more and more active,

827
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:13,302
especially when she starts
to go through puberty.

828
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:16,639
That's when, like, things
can really get crazy.

829
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:17,840
I never in a million years

830
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,075
would have thought
that that would be it.

831
00:38:20,077 --> 00:38:21,677
How violent could it get?

832
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,945
There was one case

833
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:26,015
I did where a woman
had over 300 stitches.

834
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:28,817
Couches I've seen go
flying across rooms,

835
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:31,020
people being dragged,

836
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:33,188
through the house by their hair.

837
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,456
So this could happen here, potentially?

838
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,026
Yes, potentially. Yeah.

839
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,128
It can get pretty intense.

840
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:57,458
So you guys called us in

841
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,026
because you knew you had a problem.

842
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:03,030
But I'm sure you never
imagined in a million years

843
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:05,966
that you guys were haunting each other.

844
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,269
To find out how to fix it and stop it,

845
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:09,770
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

846
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:18,112
What I would like to see
happen is for a psychic

847
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:22,750
to come in to do the initial cleansing.

848
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:27,254
And that person is going
to teach you how to do it.

849
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:28,555
This is one of things

850
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:31,558
that you and your children

851
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,462
are going to need to do
for the rest of your lives.

852
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:40,401
Over time, it'll remove
residual energy and impressions.

853
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:43,470
So it'll be a lot quieter,
a lot more peaceful.

854
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:46,907
Everybody will feel very chill.

855
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:49,877
I'm curious about one thing,
the protection that went wrong.

856
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:52,246
Will these cleansings help reverse that?

857
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:56,317
Yes, doing the monthly cleansings

858
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:00,788
will take care of a lot
of the bigger issues.

859
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,058
The second thing I would
like to see happen would be

860
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,128
for the psychic to remove
the deceased people.

861
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,998
That would be the older gentleman,

862
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,634
his main wife

863
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,636
and the second wife,

864
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:19,306
who is the teenager.

865
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,874
The third thing,

866
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,576
this is again something

867
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:24,511
that the family will need to do together

868
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:26,580
and need to keep it up.

869
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:29,917
One is hatha yoga, and then tai chi.

870
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,152
So that'll decrease the
poltergeist activity?

871
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:33,520
Yes, immensely.

872
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:35,289
Saw that look on your face

873
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,424
when you started talking
about yoga and tai chi.

874
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:40,260
I... I... I
enjoy everything.

875
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:42,496
Don't matter to me. Let's have fun.

876
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,932
- Okay.
- The other thing

877
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:47,501
that I would like to see happen

878
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:49,002
is for Lexie

879
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:52,606
to maybe see a child psychotherapist

880
00:40:52,608 --> 00:40:55,075
for her to learn

881
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,844
how to open up a little bit more,

882
00:40:56,846 --> 00:40:58,278
how to communicate

883
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,314
about her emotions a little bit more,

884
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:03,984
which will help her learn
to kind of ground out

885
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:06,253
and control her energy.

886
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,989
I think that would be
really good for her.

887
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:11,625
So, Jennie, this is gonna
be a life long thing.

888
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,327
You up for that?

889
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,763
I mean, it'll probably
get us closer and hopefully

890
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,164
get her to open up.

891
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,299
Is this something you guys
are definitely gonna wanna...

892
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,401
Look into and do? Yes.

893
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:22,903
- Yes.
- Definitely.

894
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:25,639
I have an answer and
you're turning a negative

895
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,341
- into a positive...
- Right.

896
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:29,643
For the family, for the house,

897
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:32,546
for everybody.

898
00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:34,481
Jennie and Randall
have a lot of work

899
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:37,017
to do if they want to
rid their home of the dead

900
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:38,952
and the poltergeist
that they're feeding.

901
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,755
But with the help of a
psychic and a therapist,

902
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:43,257
they can work as a family

903
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:47,060
to free themselves of the evil
that's been tearing them apart.
