1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,756
There's a lot of death.

2
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:14,325
The ground is just saturated with it.

3
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:17,028
The previous owner,
he committed suicide.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,365
There's a lot of
physical trauma going on.

5
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,834
- You think he was killed?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:24,636
Somebody keeps talking
about murder, murder,

7
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:25,880
murder, murder, murder, murder, murder,

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:26,905
murder, murder, murder, murder.

9
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,973
There's something.
There's something here.

10
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:33,011
It's trying to push
me away with a force.

11
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:37,315
It very much hates
someone in this house.

12
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,484
I just hear death.

13
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:41,753
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,388
God.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,390
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

16
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,491
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:47,759
Her face was all demonic.

18
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,494
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,297
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

20
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,698
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,233
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

22
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,369
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,371
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

24
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,521
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,187
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,922
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:06,423
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

28
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:09,627
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,794
They're everywhere.

30
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,196
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,264
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

32
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,067
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,103
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,337
...until the very end...

35
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,006
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

36
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:23,874
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,976
That's it.

38
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:27,244
...or time to get out.

39
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:31,482
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

40
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,532
I'm in the small town of
Estill Springs, Tennessee.

41
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,835
It's about 85 miles
southeast of Nashville.

42
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,304
I got a call from a
young mother named Emily.

43
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,739
She says whatever's in the house

44
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,709
hates kids and was going
after her 3-year old son.

45
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,144
She was hysterical on the phone,

46
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:02,312
and I'm really hoping
we can help her out.

47
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,252
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,087
I sweep the house from top to bottom,

49
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,756
looking for any leading information.

50
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,060
Photographs, family heirlooms,

51
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,796
even a baby's crib can
influence her findings.

52
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,865
So it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

53
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,200
When I'm done, the location

54
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,902
will be ready for tonight's walk.

55
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:42,052
There's some nutty woman
running towards me screaming.

56
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,987
She's got issues.

57
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,956
She is very physical.

58
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,492
She, like, can touch people.

59
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:51,862
Like, she's got her arm on me now.

60
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:54,164
Okay.

61
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,966
What happened?

62
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,370
She was doing creepy stuff that
actually kind of made me scared.

63
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:03,907
She made it like death.

64
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,816
When we spoke on the
phone, you sounded pretty upset.

65
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,019
Most of it was because of your son, Eli.

66
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,755
Yeah. We got him about a year ago.

67
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:20,357
He was in an orphanage from China.

68
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,126
He's waking up screaming in the night.

69
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:23,994
I go in there, he is trembling.

70
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,562
It's heartbreaking.

71
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,765
He's obviously terrified.

72
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,200
When you did adopt him, did
they give you any indication

73
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:32,703
that he was having any issues
like you're talking about?

74
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:35,072
He slept awesome. He slept all night.

75
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,607
He took a 2-hour nap during the day.

76
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,342
He had no issues.

77
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,611
It's hard because we
brought him into this.

78
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,012
Let me get some basic stuff from you.

79
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,647
How long are you guys here?

80
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:46,083
- We've been here about 4 years.
- Who's living in the house?

81
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,052
Um, it is me, my husband, Christopher,

82
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,755
and my son, Eli.

83
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,824
And recently, my youngest sister, Abby,

84
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:55,793
and her 4 year-old son have moved in.

85
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:58,428
If you can, just give
me an abbreviated version

86
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,963
of what you guys are going through here.

87
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:03,667
Well, we've heard voices,
a feeling of being watched.

88
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,602
We've seen shadow people.

89
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:08,205
And me and my husband both
have pretty extreme mood swings.

90
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,807
And when you say the mood swings,

91
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,141
what are we talking about?

92
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,843
He's very irritable.

93
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:16,046
He seems anxious and nervous
about things all the time.

94
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,081
I mean, that can't be
good for the marriage?

95
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,718
It's really hard.

96
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,854
I should be happy to be
in this home with him,

97
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,355
with our new baby.

98
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:27,558
So if we can't fix the problem
with the paranormal here,

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,992
what do you think would happen?

100
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,094
Worse things would happen to Eli.

101
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:34,531
I fear that it will get to
the point where he gets hurt.

102
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,167
I feel like it targets children.

103
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:46,410
So this lady, she's talking
about kids, little children.

104
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:50,247
She doesn't want me to go in this house.

105
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,852
She very much hates
someone in this house.

106
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,520
It feels like a male.

107
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,493
Okay, so I got punched in the stomach.

108
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,995
Do you know what by?

109
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,330
Her.

110
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,699
****.

111
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,401
That hurt like a ****.

112
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,309
This room's pretty bad for me.

113
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:23,247
I wake up seeing shadow
people standing by my bed.

114
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,716
I mean, I wake Christopher
up, and he keeps a baseball bat

115
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,417
by the bed because I've said,
"There's someone in the room.

116
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,785
There's someone here."

117
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,587
What are we talking about as
far as how often you see this?

118
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,822
Once a week, once a month.

119
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:34,524
It's easily a couple
times a week, if not more.

120
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,493
All right. So a couple
times a week, that's scary.

121
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:37,794
Yeah, it's a lot.

122
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,263
And since we've gotten Eli,

123
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,298
it seems to be that he's seeing it now,

124
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,901
and that's what's waking him up.

125
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,769
All right. So has
anything else happened?

126
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:49,039
Yes, I feel someone sitting on this bed.

127
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,774
How often is this happening?

128
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:53,076
At least once a week.

129
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:55,312
Do you think it's trying
to get into bed with you?

130
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,649
I think it's sitting there
and wants to watch me.

131
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,417
How the hell are you sleeping?

132
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,086
I don't sleep very well.
I mean, I'm 32 years old.

133
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,721
I'm sleeping with three night-lights.

134
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,490
Well, listen, you're
going through hell here.

135
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,561
What she's doing, I know, is not good.

136
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:14,598
Yeah, she is **** physical.

137
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,935
She can move things.
She can touch people.

138
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,270
I think that she's very capable of,

139
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,973
like, making noise?

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,708
She can do a lot of crazy stuff.

141
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,148
What's going on in here?

142
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,116
I saw a shadow figure,

143
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:35,385
and it was at this end of his bed.

144
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:38,021
And it was, like,
peeking over like this.

145
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,489
Describe what it looked like.

146
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,891
It was tall, dark.

147
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:42,693
I could see the head and the shoulders.

148
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,962
You couldn't see
through it. It was solid.

149
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,763
I thought someone was in his room,

150
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,265
but I was frozen.

151
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,100
It was horrible. I was terrified.

152
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:52,536
I was terrified for him.

153
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,204
It scares me right now to talk about it,

154
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,239
to be honest.

155
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,674
Yeah, I can see that.

156
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,777
It just was the worst experience
I have ever had in this house.

157
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,414
He was in an orphanage with no family.

158
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,149
To think that it's worse here

159
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,684
with a mom and dad that love him...

160
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,586
That's upsetting. Don't
feel guilty, though.

161
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,122
Is there anything else?

162
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,359
My niece told me that she saw a monster,

163
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,894
and it had a cape and red eyes.

164
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,463
No arms, no legs.

165
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:20,897
And she said she could see the body,

166
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,733
like, moving up and down.

167
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,434
I guess, like it was breathing?

168
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,036
So is it possible he's seeing that?

169
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,171
I mean, he's waking up screaming.

170
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:31,742
He's pointed over there,
said, "Scare me, scare me."

171
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:36,847
I feel like they want...

172
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,882
that they want him.

173
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:42,185
I definitely feel
like they're after him.

174
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:54,031
What I'm hearing is weird noises,

175
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,233
but then it's, like,
almost, like, inhuman?

176
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,968
Like growling?

177
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,903
But it's, like, coming from, like,

178
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,772
everywhere.

179
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,141
Trying to push me away,

180
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:07,411
with a force.

181
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:10,180
And it doesn't sound human.

182
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,922
You seeing it?

183
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:22,526
I'm seeing a version of it.

184
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,061
Can you describe it?

185
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,963
It's, like, got long legs and arms,

186
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,333
but it crawls on all four.

187
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,968
It's got a weird body.

188
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,671
And then, like, a
weird human-shaped face.

189
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:37,674
It's like screaming and ****.

190
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:40,077
It is a force.

191
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,280
It's a legitimate force.

192
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,949
This sucker is really evil.

193
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,811
So, Abby, I understand that
you recently moved down here.

194
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,846
Yep, about 3 to 4 months ago.

195
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,381
And you moved down here with your son.

196
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,049
- Yes.
- And how old is he?

197
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,617
- He's 4.
- Okay.

198
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:18,554
So, Abby, Emily told me that her
and her husband's relationship

199
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,989
has kind of gone downhill
since moving here.

200
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,758
Um, have you noticed that?

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,193
- Yeah.
- You have.

202
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,595
They're not happy
with each other right now.

203
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:30,232
I noticed he snaps really quick,

204
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:32,368
and he's said to me, "I
feel really irritated,

205
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,670
and I don't know why."

206
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,138
You've been here a few months.

207
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,940
I know your sister's been
having a lot of activity

208
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,109
since she moved in here.
What about yourself?

209
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,144
Right. Well, I've had,

210
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:45,214
just an overall feeling
of being watched.

211
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,549
You feel like you're
being watched right now?

212
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,551
Yeah. Like, I don't...

213
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:52,321
Like there's someone else in the corner.

214
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:55,424
Okay. Anything else?

215
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:57,393
My son has been having nightmares.

216
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,794
He's never had nightmares like he's had

217
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:00,062
since we moved down here.

218
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,663
He's described to me

219
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,366
a bunch of vampires wearing capes...

220
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,468
- Okay.
- With sharp teeth and red eyes.

221
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,071
So what your son described in a dream

222
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:13,208
to you is something that
Emily's niece said she saw.

223
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,977
Yeah.

224
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,912
I want to feel like I
made the right choice

225
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:19,982
and didn't bring him into
somewhere that's not safe.

226
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:21,350
'Cause I'm...

227
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,154
I moved down here to make
a better life for him and I.

228
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,855
Anything else going on?

229
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,791
Um, I get panic attacks.

230
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,892
Okay.

231
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,528
And then, like, I can't breathe.

232
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,630
Like I feel like I have
to take a deep breath.

233
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:38,767
And then my heart will just
feel like it's going really fast,

234
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,903
beating out of my chest almost.

235
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,671
You have any other physical problems?

236
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:46,542
Every once in a while, I get
a feeling of nauseousness,

237
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,510
like, really sick to my stomach.

238
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:52,781
But when I'm outside, I fell better.

239
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:55,184
There's something...
There's something here.

240
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,988
I can't tell what this
strange-looking creature

241
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,991
is, possibly a demon.

242
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:05,461
If anybody has any,

243
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:09,598
predispositions to, say,

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,801
being depressed or anxious or angry,

245
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:16,038
it'll amplify that tenfold.

246
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,041
Also, if they have any,

247
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:22,511
existing illnesses,
it'll go in there

248
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:27,616
and attack that and
make it 10 times worse.

249
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:31,320
It can make someone very ill,

250
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,689
whether mentally or physically.

251
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:40,729
Somebody's sleepwalking, this man.

252
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:42,397
Male.

253
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,400
I think he's being
influenced by this thing.

254
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,469
And then someone just yelled, "Murder!"

255
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:49,271
Somebody keeps talking
about murder, murder,

256
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,460
murder, murder, murder, murder, murder,

257
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:51,465
murder, murder, murder, murder.

258
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,348
So, Chris, I was talking to Emily.

259
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,250
She was talking about the stuff
that's going on in the house.

260
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:04,620
Um, she said your
personality has changed

261
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:06,321
since the activity picked up.

262
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:07,656
I mean, do you agree with that?

263
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:10,292
Yeah, she says I'm a
little bit more edgy now.

264
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:14,496
You know, I... I can
feel I get angry faster.

265
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,465
- Are you concerned about it?
- Yeah.

266
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,500
I mean, I... I want to go
back to the way we used to be.

267
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,102
So do you believe
Emily when she tells you

268
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,104
about all the experiences she's having?

269
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,372
- I believe her.
- Okay.

270
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,173
I wish I could see
something just at least once,

271
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,609
just so I can know what her
and Eli are going through.

272
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,378
You've had no experiences?

273
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,712
There's a few things,

274
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,382
but I'm not sure if
they're paranormal not

275
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,050
Okay, so let's go through 'em.

276
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:37,886
Okay. I... I hear the floor creaking.

277
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,155
It sounds like somebody walking.

278
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,823
Could it be somebody walking?

279
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,726
Nah, if I'm home alone,
I'll still hear it.

280
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,361
All right, so how do youla that?

281
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:49,498
I don't know. I think
it might be the cat.

282
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,133
Cat?

283
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,968
What's the cat weigh?
Six pounds? I mean...

284
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,837
Maybe. I don't really know what it is.

285
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,606
All right. Is there anything
else that's going on with you?

286
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,974
Yeah. Sometimes, you know,

287
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,442
if I'm out in the garage working,

288
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:02,044
I just kind of get this weird feeling

289
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,079
somebody's staring at you.

290
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,981
And how do you explain that one?

291
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,950
I was told that the previous owner,

292
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,619
he committed suicide.

293
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,054
Okay, do you know how?

294
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,989
I was told he shut the garage doors

295
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,993
and, ran his lawnmower.

296
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,928
That's something I'll
definitely look into.

297
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,163
Anything else?

298
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,564
I'm tired a lot.

299
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,733
Is it while you're home
or while you're at work?

300
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,768
Usually when I'm home.
Actually, when I leave,

301
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,037
and I go to work, I
feel... I feel pretty good.

302
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,672
Mold or anything like that in the house

303
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,040
when you had it inspected?

304
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,408
No.

305
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,510
Well, it doesn't sound like
you're much of a skeptic.

306
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,479
Maybe. I love my family.

307
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:39,615
I'm gonna do whatever
I can to keep 'em safe.

308
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,650
- Okay.
- That's why you're here.

309
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,822
Got it.

310
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:48,757
Okay, I think I know what's going on.

311
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:55,163
Wow, this one was hard to figure out.

312
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,766
- So what do think's happening?
- I'm pretty damn sure.

313
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,601
There are Native Americans here

314
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:02,771
who are not mentally sound.

315
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,807
And I think, if a person,

316
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,442
a living person, is in this area,

317
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,678
they can form an attachment.

318
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,179
Have they made this attachment?

319
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:14,216
Yes. To a living male here.

320
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:16,852
And I think these Native Americans,

321
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:20,956
that they're acting like a demon

322
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,626
and that they're influencing
a living male here

323
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:29,264
to potentially,
kill his whole family.

324
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,799
Why do they want to do that?

325
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,201
They're just crazy.

326
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,221
Look, I always ask homeowners
for leads on history.

327
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,223
Half the time, they're useless.

328
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,493
But in this case, turns out
the owner did die in the garage.

329
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,295
I'm heading over to meet with his sons,

330
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:02,098
who say they don't believe
his death was accidental.

331
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,506
I know it's a touchy subject. Your dad

332
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,441
passed away right here in this garage.

333
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:15,211
Before we get to that, what
kind of a man was your father?

334
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:18,481
He worked two jobs.
Mom stayed home with us.

335
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,249
This is a picture of mom and dad,

336
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,852
taken in '92.

337
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,954
I know this is all
very hard to talk about,

338
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,922
but I got a weird question
to ask both of you guys.

339
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:31,527
Um, did mom and/or dad ever talk

340
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,696
about anything strange
going on in the house

341
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:36,432
that they couldn't explain?

342
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,067
Dad said one time

343
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,838
that he thought the house was haunted.

344
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,974
I know your dad died in 2011.

345
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,709
Is that right?

346
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,644
Okay, is your mom still around?

347
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,913
- She's passed away.
- When did she die?

348
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,581
It's 2002.

349
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,052
She had a stage 4 brain tumor,

350
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,586
and she just got tired of fighting it.

351
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,956
And she passed away
in the master bedroom.

352
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,592
- How old was she at the time?
- 76, wasn't it?

353
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:07,163
76, okay. How'd your father take that?

354
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:11,701
I don't think he was that upset at all.

355
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,536
- That's a little strange.
- Yeah.

356
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,204
Sounds like you and your
father didn't get along.

357
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,739
No, not at all.

358
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:18,908
I tried for 20 years in the military

359
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,012
to feel like he felt I
was worthy of something.

360
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:25,181
And it never happened.

361
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,850
All right. So what happened
after your mom passed?

362
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,819
Within a week or so after Mom died,

363
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,088
he had a couple girls living here.

364
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,290
Wait a minute. How old was
your father again at this time?

365
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,691
About 82.

366
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,993
And how old were the two
women that moved in here.

367
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,429
In their 30s.

368
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,997
They was taking his money.

369
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,934
He'd gone through at least $100,000.

370
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:48,104
He pawned everything he had.

371
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,740
Now, I know your dad died
right here in the garage.

372
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:52,641
What was the official cause of death?

373
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,810
Carbon monoxide toxicity.

374
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:58,981
Here's a copy of the autopsy report.

375
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,217
Where'd they say that was coming from?

376
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:03,486
There was a lawnmower sitting
right here that was running.

377
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,621
How old was your father at the time?

378
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,456
- 86.
- Was he in bad health?

379
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,159
- No.
- He could outdo me, no problem.

380
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,660
What do you think happened?

381
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,663
I think he was killed in
there and brought out here.

382
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,699
- You think he was killed?
- Yeah.

383
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,234
Do you agree with that, Kim?

384
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,336
Yeah, I don't believe
he committed suicide.

385
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,171
What happens to these two girls
that are living in the house?

386
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:23,639
Were they ever questioned?

387
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,407
No.

388
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:32,181
Don't like it in here.

389
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,683
I feel like death.
There's a lot of death.

390
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:41,257
Like the ground is just ****

391
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,491
Saturated with it.

392
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,627
Feels very deep here.

393
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,297
I feel a male.

394
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,267
And I feel death and darkness.

395
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,202
I feel, like, a loss of control.

396
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:56,038
And I feel something around my neck.

397
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,274
I feel like I'm being strangled.

398
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:05,815
So far, I know of two deaths
on my client's property...

399
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:09,185
one in the master bedroom,
the other in the garage.

400
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,020
But I want to see if
there's anything more

401
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:14,190
that could help my case.

402
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:18,394
Searching through old records,
I find the Martin family.

403
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,429
Turns out, they lost four
of their seven children

404
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,364
while living on Emily and Chris' land.

405
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,770
So I asked the local genealogist

406
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:29,138
to look into these deaths for me.

407
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,606
I'm meeting her at a small cemetery

408
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,374
right near Emily and Chris' property,

409
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:34,076
where she says she's
got something to show me

410
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,644
that might help my case.

411
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,955
So Kathryn, I appreciate you
helping me out with the case.

412
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,323
But why'd you want to meet here?

413
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,325
Well, this is where a lot of
the Martin family is buried.

414
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,693
- Right here?
- Yes, sir.

415
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,428
Okay.

416
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,163
Before we get to the
deaths of these kids,

417
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,731
um, what do we know about the family?

418
00:18:55,733 --> 00:19:00,202
John Graves Martin owned
this land from 1875 to 1927.

419
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,371
Do you know how much
property they had here?

420
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:05,975
Yeah, at its peak, the
Martins had 560 acres.

421
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,210
So we know from the
census he lost four kids.

422
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,745
- Yes.
- All right.

423
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,113
So what were you able to find out?

424
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,482
Well, unfortunately, not
much. During this time period,

425
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,818
Tennessee didn't require
death certificates.

426
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,687
- Okay.
- So what we do know is, by 1900,

427
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,122
he'd lost two of the children.

428
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,658
And by 1910, he lost the other two.

429
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,293
Okay, do we know what they died from,

430
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,928
how old, their names, stuff like that?

431
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,831
We only know the name of one
of their daughters, named Era.

432
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,467
And she passed away before 1910.

433
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,736
So now there's three kids
left. What happened with them?

434
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,604
Well, all of them grew
up to have families

435
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,439
and lived here in Tennessee.

436
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,009
Okay.

437
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,977
The violent woman

438
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,281
who attacked me is
following me wherever I go.

439
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,516
She may hate that I'm
here, but I'm not leaving

440
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:50,319
until I find out who she was in life.

441
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,054
Can you describe
what she looks like?

442
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:58,327
Seeing her young, she looks
like she could be from anytime

443
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:01,030
from 1870 to, like, 1920.

444
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,299
But when she shows
herself as an old lady,

445
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,301
she's looking real recent.

446
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,741
She's talking about
something about her father,

447
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:17,079
'cause she's talking about
how her father was a good man.

448
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,914
You know, I think her whole family got

449
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,883
****.

450
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,786
Something... Something bad.

451
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,788
Some kind of vendetta.

452
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,157
She is fixated on...

453
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,025
on children.

454
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,194
She's trying to protect
the living children

455
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,197
from the male... the
living male in the house,

456
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,067
because she, I believe,

457
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,536
understands that there's an attachment

458
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:44,039
that's influencing him to
potentially harm the children.

459
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,543
This is really close
to my client's property.

460
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,012
Indeed, this was part of
the original Martin farm.

461
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:52,081
- Who owns it now?
- John Graves Martin

462
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,384
sold this cemetery to
the city of Estill Springs

463
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,419
in 1900 for $30,

464
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,588
but there was a stipulation in the deed.

465
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:06,729
He wrote in there that it
was for whites and no other.

466
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,797
- Now, did that change?
- It did.

467
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,101
Now it's a city cemetery,
so anyone can be buried here.

468
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,770
There's more than 860 burials here.

469
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,139
People are still being
buried here today.

470
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:24,913
There's a lot of dead around,

471
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,648
restless souls.

472
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,751
How many?

473
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:32,821
Thirty to 40, maybe, people?

474
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:34,957
And this is all different
**** time periods.

475
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,694
This is very, um, weird.

476
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:42,398
Like, some are old,
you know, like, way old.

477
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,634
Some of them, they're like recent

478
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,170
and that they could do real harm.

479
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,740
Something's not right
here. Something's not right.

480
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,149

unexplained activity in your home,

Files!" to submit your story.

484
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,823
And we'll help if we can.

485
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:18,038
You know, something else
caught my attention in research.

486
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,841
A brutal case where a mob
tortured and killed a black man

487
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,976
right near Emily and Chris' house.

488
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:24,544
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

489
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,346
who said it was one of
the most heinous crimes

490
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,081
in the state's history.

491
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:37,958
Doing my research, I came across
this lynching that took place,

492
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,593
looks like, right by
my client's property.

493
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:41,395
- What do
you know about it?

494
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:44,264
This happens February 8th, 1918.

495
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:47,033
Jim Mcllherron was an
African-American male

496
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,368
walking down Main Street.

497
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,270
And he's confronted by three white men.

498
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,905
They start throwing rocks at him

499
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,774
and throwing racial epithets at him.

500
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:55,842
- What happens next?
- They pick on the wrong guy.

501
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,778
Mcllherron is an expert marksman.

502
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
He's armed. He pulls out his gun.

503
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:01,381
He shoots six shots.

504
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:03,784
When the dust clears,
two of the men are dead

505
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,752
and one is, badly injured.

506
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,354
I have a copy of the
two death certificates

507
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:08,555
of the men who died.

508
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:10,257
So he kills two
out of the three guys.

509
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,459
Yes, sir.

510
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:14,327
It's in broad daylight.

511
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,029
He knows he has to get
out of town immediately.

512
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,098
He goes about 40 miles,

513
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,567
to a place called
McMinnville, a small town.

514
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,103
And when word of this shooting happens,

515
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:25,105
several hundred men

516
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,541
start to create a mob to follow him.

517
00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:30,243
They collect dogs.
They find him in a barn.

518
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,412
They surround
him. A shootout ensues.

519
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:33,947
Hundreds of shots are fired.

520
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:36,616
Mcllherron is shot in the eye,

521
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,869
in the arm, and in the leg.

522
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:42,172
Okay.

523
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:44,908
Something bad happened.

524
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,044
This was a long time
ago, during the day.

525
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,780
Something bad happened. And it...

526
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:55,552
And that set the stage for
all the **** up ****

527
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:58,088
That has happened since
and is happening now.

528
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,926
**** no. Hell no!

529
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:04,227
What?

530
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,929
Somebody... Okay, there's a lot

531
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,231
of physical trauma going on here.

532
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:12,369
People being shot or stabbed here.

533
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:15,071
So does Mcllherron die
from the gunshot wounds?

534
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:17,174
Nope. They put him back on a train

535
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,709
and take him back to Estill Springs.

536
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:22,179
When the train arrives,
about 1,500 people

537
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,547
are there.

538
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,215
They take him about a half a mile out.

539
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:26,483
They make two fires.

540
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:29,019
They tie him to a tree
and begin to torture him.

541
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:30,453
What kind of torture we talking about?

542
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,355
They poked him with red-hot irons

543
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:34,858
and shoved it into
his... into his stomach.

544
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,159
Okay.

545
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:38,528
Took it out, burned
either side of his neck.

546
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,164
They castrated him
before they burned him.

547
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,699
This is not the same lynching,

548
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,768
but this is the kind
of gruesome spectacle

549
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,804
that we're talking about.

550
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,539
Jesus.

551
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:52,509
I've seen a lot of really bad things

552
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:54,110
in my time on the police department.

553
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:56,279
And I got to tell ya, this is...

554
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:59,316
It... It's pretty messed up.

555
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:01,318
Knowing the maps at the
time, this looks like

556
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,020
this might have happened either
on or near my client's property.

557
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:05,622
Does that sound right to you?

558
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:06,790
Absolutely.

559
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,892
Either right next to it,
or on the property itself.

560
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,194
And I know the Martin
family owned it at the time.

561
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:13,230
Would they have at least been there,

562
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:14,731
or been involved in this lynching?

563
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,066
Absolutely.

564
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,701
If they weren't a part of it,
I'm sure they knew about it.

565
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:19,436
More than likely, just about everybody

566
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:22,072
in Estill Springs was a part of this.

567
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,774
Was anybody ever convicted
for this lynching?

568
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:26,109
No.

569
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:27,911
In fact, the members of the
mob took souvenirs of his body.

570
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,347
They took his ears, they took a finger.

571
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:32,082
- For what?
- They displayed him

572
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,750
in the local store.

573
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:36,853
That's pretty sick.

574
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:41,157
My, Achilles, got chopped.

575
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,360
Um, something happened back here,

576
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,928
like I got cut.

577
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,297
So I'm gonna say there was,
like, an attack or some...

578
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,899
something like this.

579
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:53,770
See, and more I go back,
the more pain I'm feeling.

580
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:55,538
My head hurts.

581
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,340
Head hurts.

582
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:10,920
I saw a lot of disturbing
activity on my walk.

583
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:13,089
But the dead woman
attacking a living man

584
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:15,158
had me the most concerned.

585
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,827
She had really long hair.

586
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,765
And she was wearing a dress.

587
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:25,001
She can punch people.

588
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:28,004
And I'd like to show,
like, a living man.

589
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,907
And have her, like,
punch him in the stomach.

590
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,613
Is this what you saw?

591
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,450
Yes.

592
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:03,463
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

593
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:05,565
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

594
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,334
and our clients for the first time.

595
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,838
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Emily, her husband, Chris.

596
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,540
And this her sister, Abby,

597
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,208
who recently moved into their home

598
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,876
with her
4- year-old son.

599
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,545
The main reason we were called in

600
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,380
is for this beautiful, young boy here.

601
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:21,948
This is Eli.

602
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,984
This is their son

603
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,253
that they adopted from China last year.

604
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:29,756
They wanted to give him a better life.

605
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:31,658
But the activity's so bad in the house

606
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,326
that Emily actually told me

607
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:35,595
he'd probably be better
off back at that orphanage.

608
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:38,298
It broke my heart when
she said that to me.

609
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,433
I'm really hoping that you
can give us some answers

610
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,402
and, help them out.

611
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:49,142
This was one of the worst investigations

612
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:50,977
I've ever done.

613
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:54,247
And that's why we're
here in this barn tonight

614
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,116
because there was no way in hell

615
00:27:57,118 --> 00:28:00,086
I was going back to your property.

616
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:01,721
The first place

617
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,725
that I got pulled to
was to the backyard.

618
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:09,963
I walked over to the detached garage.

619
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:13,833
And I had this overwhelming feeling

620
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:17,370
of death and darkness in there.

621
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:19,372
And it seemed like the ground

622
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:22,141
was just kind of saturated with it.

623
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:25,445
And I almost felt
like I was gonna vomit.

624
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,447
Wow.

625
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:30,717
There was some male.

626
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,019
And I felt, like, a loss of control.

627
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:36,356
And then I also felt like
something was around my neck.

628
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,992
And I was being strangled.

629
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,060
When I'm in the garage,
you get this feeling

630
00:28:41,062 --> 00:28:43,696
that somebody is kind of watching you.

631
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:44,964
Now Chris is a skeptic.

632
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,066
And he always tries to figure out

633
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,768
that it's not paranormal.

634
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,538
I'm a see-it-to-believe-it
person.

635
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,439
Now, before Chris and
Emily owned the house,

636
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,910
it was owned by Robert
Dawson and his wife, Barbara.

637
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:59,345
Um, I got a photo of that couple.

638
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:01,781
Now, Barbara passed away from cancer

639
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,751
in the master bedroom in 2007.

640
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:06,185
She had been sick for a while.

641
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:07,620
What was kind of funny

642
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,589
is Robert, according to his two sons,

643
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:11,724
who I interviewed,

644
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,660
didn't seem too broken up about it.

645
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:15,828
Now, the guy was 82 at the time.

646
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,530
And a week after his wife died,

647
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:20,833
he had two women in their
30s move in with him.

648
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:24,337
Now, they took advantage of
him, they took all his money.

649
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:27,574
Now, 2011, he was found
dead in that garage,

650
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,108
according to the autopsy protocol

651
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,945
that I got right here.

652
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:35,081
Official cause of death was
carbon monoxide poisoning.

653
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,051
That makes sense to me,
that feeling of, like,

654
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:41,287
darkness and despair and negativity.

655
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,089
All that you feel in that garage

656
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,292
that affects someone's personality?

657
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:51,164
I think that a person
would feel weighted down,

658
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,768
an agitation, tired, drained.

659
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,804
I feel a lot of that,

660
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,872
just not necessarily just the garage,

661
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,341
but just being in...

662
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,676
on the property, I guess you could say.

663
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:07,180
When I leave, I actually
kind of feel better.

664
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,784
What else did you see?

665
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:16,756
One of the more powerful dead people

666
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:18,157
on your property

667
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,360
is the dead woman who I met outside.

668
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,496
And she was just
screaming and freaking out,

669
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,798
charging me like a maniac.

670
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,001
I think the living
would possibly hear her

671
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:32,205
when she's flipping out and
also see her as a shadow.

672
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,108
The other thing I was
getting a lot with her

673
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,910
and about her is her
fixation on children.

674
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,780
And she also made it very clear

675
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:44,884
that she does not like living adults.

676
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:48,921
The biggest concern with her
is that she can be very violent,

677
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:51,557
and unfortunately, physical.

678
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,293
I found that out because
when I was getting ready

679
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,029
to go into the house,

680
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:58,731
she freaking

681
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,234
jumped me and punched
me square in the stomach.

682
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,203
Um, you're hitting on a lot

683
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:06,005
of the things these
guys are experiencing.

684
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:09,042
First off, um, you say
she's fixated on kids?

685
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,877
- Yeah.
- Emily, do me a favor

686
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:14,814
and tell Amy what you
see over Eli's crib.

687
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:17,950
I saw a shadow
person, really tall.

688
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:21,621
And it was just standing by
his bed looking down at him.

689
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,222
He wakes up at night

690
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:26,459
screaming and crying,
saying, "Scare me. Scare me."

691
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:27,660
Tell Amy

692
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,896
about the other shadow
figures you see, as well.

693
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,165
I see 'em around my bed all the time.

694
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,200
Couple times a week,
I wake up in the night

695
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:35,702
seeing stuff.

696
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:38,738
Do you ever hear any sounds or
anything while it's going on?

697
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,306
A lot of the times, I'll be home alone,

698
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,108
sitting there watching TV.

699
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,243
And, you know, I'll hear
stuff throughout the house.

700
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,679
And I just think it's
the dog or a cat or...

701
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,247
Something.

702
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:50,149
Now, is that this woman doing all this?

703
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:54,220
It could be her. I
mean, she's got issues.

704
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:59,025
The person that she said
she really dislikes the most,

705
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,793
as far as living people in the house,

706
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,830
is the male in the house.

707
00:32:03,832 --> 00:32:06,299
And she really has it out for him.

708
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:10,069
And I had a sketch done

709
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:13,439
of what she would like to do to him.

710
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,954
This is what this person
wants to do to you, apparently.

711
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,196
So she just wants to take me out?

712
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:39,165
Yeah.

713
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,868
Can she?

714
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,036
Yes.

715
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:45,972
Chris, did you think
tonight you'd be a target

716
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:47,373
when we sat down?

717
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,842
I didn't think I really
had much to do with it

718
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,344
at all, to be honest with you.

719
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,580
I'm here to help her.
I'm here to support her.

720
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:57,550
Looks like you may need the support.

721
00:32:57,552 --> 00:33:00,586
Kind of looking that way.

722
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:03,189
You have any idea who
this crazy, old bat is?

723
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:08,928
The few things that I was
able to extract from her were

724
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,364
she can look a couple of different ways.

725
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,499
When she showed herself
as being younger,

726
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,101
it looked like she could be from, like,

727
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,203
1870 to 1920.

728
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:21,974
But then, when she
showed me herself older,

729
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:25,111
it seemed extremely current.

730
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:27,480
She was obsessed with her father.

731
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,849
And she kept saying that
her father was a good man

732
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:33,152
and her whole family had gotten screwed.

733
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:37,256
The other thing that I got was
the connection with children,

734
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:39,992
and that kids were
extremely important to her

735
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:41,761
when she was alive.

736
00:33:41,763 --> 00:33:44,897
And they're still
important to her in death.

737
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,267
Even though she may be scaring children,

738
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,705
she's actually trying to protect them.

739
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:55,541
So I'm just going off
the dates you gave me.

740
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,443
There are a couple of women
who lived on the property

741
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,345
that might fit the bill.

742
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:00,980
Now, back in the late 1800s,

743
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:04,150
this house sat in the
middle of a 560-acre farm.

744
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:07,353
The guy who owned it was
named John Graves Martin.

745
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:08,988
Well, he had seven
children. Out of the seven,

746
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,491
four died at a very young age.

747
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:15,995
Three of his kids survived,
and two of them were daughters.

748
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:17,663
The one that makes the most sense,

749
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:19,632
based on what you told
me, is Edna Martin.

750
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:22,902
Now, she was born in
1895, grew up on the land.

751
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:24,804
And she died in 1986.

752
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,772
The other thing is you mentioned

753
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,342
her being protective of the father.

754
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,944
John Graves Martin built a
cemetery right on the property.

755
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,512
But when he sold it to the city,

756
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:36,883
he said it had to be for whites only.

757
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:38,818
To me, it feels like Edna.

758
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,387
Like, looking back at this whole thing,

759
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,757
I almost feel like the
punch in the stomach was...

760
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,893
was a second warning.

761
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,028
Warning for what?

762
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,631
To **** leave.

763
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,636
When I walked through the door,

764
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:59,272
I'm hearing this, like, growling.

765
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:02,141
And it just sounded like
what you would imagine, like,

766
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:06,946
a demon voice to sound like.

767
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:10,249
The other thing was how
it was projecting itself.

768
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,118
And what it looked like was,

769
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,788
like, it had these long arms.

770
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,991
And then it had, like,
this human, deformed head.

771
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,094
My sister's daughter,

772
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:28,100
she woke up to a black,
hooded figure with red eyes.

773
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:31,871
Abby's son had a dream just like that.

774
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:34,040
He said that there was a bunch of

775
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:36,509
vampire-type people standing
in a group with capes.

776
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,177
And they kept just staring at him.

777
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,745
And he woke up.

778
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:42,848
So is this something that
Chris' niece might have seen?

779
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,818
Yes.

780
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,620
It took me a while to figure out,

781
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:49,288
but then it finally hit me.

782
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,023
This thing is not a demon.

783
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,560
It's dead Native Americans
who are mentally ill.

784
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:56,095
And they are projecting themselves

785
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,064
as a demon to scare you.

786
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,735
They can focus in on people's weaknesses

787
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:05,438
very quickly and easily.

788
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,007
And so someone has a predisposition

789
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:11,177
to being depressed, anxious, angry,

790
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:14,780
they will draw that out
and amplify it tenfold.

791
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:16,282
I woke up in the middle of the night,

792
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:19,418
just that bad, heavy chest feeling.

793
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,987
Can't breathe.

794
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,089
And I constantly...
It seems to be actually

795
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:24,824
getting worse over the
past couple of weeks.

796
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:28,060
Yeah, like, I can't even
get out of bed some days.

797
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:31,397
We aggravate each
other, and it's nonstop.

798
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,800
What... What the hell do they want?

799
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:37,370
You know, they definitely
keyed in on, you know,

800
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:39,839
the male of the house.

801
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:43,676
I saw this thing form
attachments to this male.

802
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:47,546
And they've already
attached themselves to you.

803
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,448
Whoa.

804
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,618
Slight things could be
headaches, sleeplessness.

805
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,354
There might be some
sleepwalking incidents.

806
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:58,357
I'm a sleepwalker.

807
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,960
Other people might see the behaviors

808
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:04,563
more than the individual
who's being directly affected.

809
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,899
And things that they
would notice might be

810
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:09,068
abnormal aggressive behavior
that doesn't make sense

811
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,870
for that individual.

812
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:13,205
Yeah. I mean, he's a different person.

813
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,408
- The snapping, real...
- Yeah.

814
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,109
You know, just snaps real quick.

815
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,111
He never used to do that, ever.

816
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:22,782
The problem is is that
this attachment obviously

817
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,551
can be extremely dangerous.

818
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:29,088
And the thing that I did get, um,

819
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,591
was that their ultimate goal would be

820
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:37,296
for this individual to harm
and/or kill the entire family.

821
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,968
All right. So
let me get this straight.

822
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,737
You're saying that whatever's there

823
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:47,573
is trying to influence
him to kill his family?

824
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:49,308
Absolutely.

825
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:55,214
I'm extremely frightened
for you and your family.

826
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,091
So, Chris, I got to be honest.

827
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:16,527
You had so few experiences
and seemed like such a skeptic,

828
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:19,230
I almost thought about
leaving you out of the review.

829
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,232
But now we have to figure out

830
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:24,235
how to save not only you,

831
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:26,437
but your beautiful family.

832
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,773
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

833
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:34,078
So there's a deceased female

834
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,316
at the location who might be Edna,

835
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,985
who is unstable.

836
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,688
And she's coming after
you because she's afraid

837
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,491
you're going to hurt the kids.

838
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:51,696
And then you have the
unstable Native Americans

839
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:53,965
who are targeting your family

840
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:57,001
to, essentially, be exterminated.

841
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:03,474
Here are the things that can be done.

842
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:07,812
The first thing is the
garage needs to be cleansed.

843
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:11,716
That should remove all of that residual

844
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,885
negative darkness that,

845
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:19,123
unfortunately, is surrounding
the male's demise there.

846
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,060
After that, I want her gone.

847
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:24,429
So what I would like to see with her

848
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:27,265
would be a male medium brought in

849
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:31,936
who has a very authoritative
kind of presence.

850
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:35,273
And that individual should
come and move her on.

851
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:36,974
This might take a couple of visits

852
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:40,378
just because she is wicked.

853
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,247
Now, with the Native Americans,

854
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:46,084
a team of people need to come in.

855
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:50,154
You need a Cherokee Native
American medicine person

856
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:54,125
or shaman who needs
to perform a clearing

857
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,461
and removal ritual.

858
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:58,763
At the same time, a religious person,

859
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,164
such as a priest,

860
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,567
needs to be brought in
who performs an exorcism

861
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,436
of the land...

862
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:08,039
the house, and of you.

863
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:14,045
Once all of this has been done,
you will know within the week

864
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:17,215
if it has been successful or not.

865
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,917
If we do all this stuff,
and it doesn't work...

866
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,186
You just get the **** in your car,

867
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,188
and you leave.

868
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,525
I don't want to go home.

869
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:32,163
I'm just really nervous,
anxious, worried.

870
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:33,564
I'm scared.

871
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:36,033
I mean, I knew it was bad.

872
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:38,769
I just didn't think
it was to that extreme.

873
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,738
So what would happen if we didn't do

874
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,607
any of that stuff you said? We just...

875
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,108
You would end up killing your family.

876
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,680
You gonna do this exorcism thing?

877
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:51,782
Or you gonna say BS on it?

878
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,519
I'm willing to try.

879
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:55,987
Well, no, no. It's not "willing to try."

880
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,421
You're either gonna
do it, or you're not.

881
00:40:57,423 --> 00:40:58,856
There's no in between here.

882
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,691
I mean, if it'll make me feel better.

883
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:02,360
It's not a matter of feeling better.

884
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,362
She's telling you, "If
you don't get this done,

885
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:06,864
you're gonna do harm
to your own family."

886
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:09,634
So, Chris, you gonna
have this exorcism done?

887
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,669
- Yeah.
- Okay.

888
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:14,705
Well, do I have to even ask you
if you're gonna do this stuff?

889
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,641
I'm definitely doing it.

890
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,176
I'll do whatever it takes.

891
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:21,812
It's crazy to me to think...

892
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,282
that this is happening to me.

893
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:25,983
It's just hard to say, "No,"

894
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,186
when everything you said is so right.

895
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,524
The only way Chris can
save himself and his family

896
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:36,594
is to bring in a priest
to perform an exorcism.

897
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:39,630
If that works, a medium
and a team of shaman

898
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:41,598
can clear out the rest of the dead,

899
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:45,359
and his family will finally be
able to live a peaceful life.
