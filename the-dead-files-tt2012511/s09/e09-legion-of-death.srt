1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,611
This is where the dead roam.

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,647
Really not good for kids here,
not good at all.

3
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,250
We want to protect 'em.
It makes me feel terrible.

4
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,754
Somebody's being
stabbed in the stomach.

5
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,389
Are you having any kind
of health issues?

6
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,157
The stabbing pains
in my back.

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,395
The shadow people are
**** killing people here.

8
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,897
This house is not a home.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,066
I just hear death.

10
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,368
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,703
God.

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,805
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

13
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,973
I see dead people.

14
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,174
Her face was all demonic.

15
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,976
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,879
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

17
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,280
...and they speak to me.

18
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,249
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

19
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,951
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,853
Something happened.
Bam. Bam. Bam.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,021
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,556
I'm Steve DiShiavi.

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,825
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,293
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

25
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,897
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,799
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,601
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

28
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,970
But Steve and I
never speak...

29
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,039
We never communicate
during an investigation...

30
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,307
...until the very end...

31
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,909
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

32
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,710
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

33
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,879
That's it.

34
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,781
...or time to get out.

35
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:26,051
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,135
I'm in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.

37
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,971
It's about 80 miles west
of Charlotte.

38
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,840
So I got a call
from a woman named Donna,

39
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,641
who's a mother of three.

40
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,244
Now she lives in a big,
beautiful, suburban house.

41
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,147
Trouble is, she says the whole
family's being terrorized.

42
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,884
But her special needs daughter
is getting the worst of it.

43
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,552
She sounded really bad
on the phone

44
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,854
and says if we can't help her,

45
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,589
someone's gonna get
seriously hurt.

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,698
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,567
I clear the area
of any leading information,

48
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,903
removing religious symbols,

49
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,372
artwork,
and other personal items

50
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,542
that could influence
her findings.

51
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,544
When I'm done,

52
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,347
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:45,163
I'm having feelings
of very deep sadness

54
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,600
and uncontrollable shaking
and fear.

55
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,236
So much, pain and crying.

56
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,606
Terrible, terrible.

57
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,213
And I hear this house
is not a home.

58
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,925
So, Donna, when we spoke
on the phone,

59
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,826
you were obviously upset.

60
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,695
What's goin' on?
- We moved here,

61
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,565
and it's -- it's been
not what I dreamed about.

62
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:24,670
We, all five of us,
sleep here in the living room.

63
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,738
You're tellin' me the entire
family's sleepin' in this room?

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,775
Right, 'cause no one wants
to sleep upstairs.

65
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,910
We all feel better together.

66
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,612
Give me an idea of what you guys
are goin' through.

67
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,081
Well, we hear, um, footsteps.

68
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,817
Um, we hear
unexplainable noises.

69
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,388
Um, we see shadows everywhere,
apparitions, everything.

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,223
Everything that you can
think of,

71
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,426
it seems like we have seen
in every room.

72
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,462
People are being scratched
and just feeling

73
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,497
like they're being touched.

74
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,366
How are you living
like this?

75
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,602
It's very exhausting.

76
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,770
And when we moved here,
I was perfectly healthy.

77
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,740
And -- and now I'm just sick
all the time,

78
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,042
kidney stones,
cervical cancer.

79
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:09,214
It's gall bladder,
migraines, depression.

80
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,717
It's one thing after another.

81
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,152
I'm just ready for it to
be over any way it has to be.

82
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,587
Whatever, it has to be done.

83
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,055
Okay.

84
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,562
I feel sick in here.

85
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,565
I feel nauseous,
awful, terrible.

86
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,135
I would think the living
would **** feel sick here.

87
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:34,973
There'd be a lot of nausea,
anxiety, and anger.

88
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,546
I see an angry man.

89
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,349
He hurt people.

90
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,784
He's scary.

91
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,391
The living, they hear the guy.

92
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,527
They hear walking,
up and down the stairs,

93
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,762
all over the place.

94
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,865
And I do feel like,
when they're sleeping,

95
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,133
I feel like,

96
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,436
he does inappropriate things
to the women,

97
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,005
um, very inappropriate.

98
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,042
Um, very, very inappropriate.

99
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,177
I think he's the one
making people sick.

100
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,945
I don't want to go upstairs.

101
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,584
All right, so, Donna,

102
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,119
who exactly lives in the house
with you?

103
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,622
Well, this is my family.

104
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,324
- Okay. Who's here?
- This is Tyler. He's 21.

105
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,527
- Okay.
- Austin's 15.

106
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,062
Abbie is 11.

107
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,698
And that's me and my husband.

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,200
Now you mentioned on the phone
Abbie has a condition.

109
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,804
Right. She was diagnosed
with selective mutism.

110
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,674
And it's basically, um,
an anxiety disorder.

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,877
When she's asked anything
that actually bothers her,

112
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,280
if it's any tension,

113
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:51,883
um, she -- she shuts down
and she's not able to talk.

114
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,353
Do you think it's caused
by what's goin' on in the house?

115
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,090
Or do you think it's something
she was born with?

116
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,360
It seems to me
that it may be the cause.

117
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,562
And I think
there's things like,

118
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,063
she doesn't want to ever
go in the bathroom.

119
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,165
And I think
there is something more

120
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,501
that she's not able
to tell me about.

121
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,070
She'll stay in the bed,
she'll cover her head up,

122
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,973
and she just will not talk
for a day.

123
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,142
There's nothing to console her.
You can't do anything.

124
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,677
And it just broke my heart.

125
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,078
That's very concerning
for me

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,047
because she may
be experiencing

127
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,548
a hell of a lot more
than you know.

128
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,151
Sometimes I worry that it takes
advantage of the fact

129
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,520
that she can't tell me
everything.

130
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,021
That's why we're just
praying that --

131
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,257
that y'all can help us.

132
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,829
Don't like it in here.

133
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,531
I don't like this space at all.

134
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,767
There's so much here.
My god.

135
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,970
I'm -- I'm like, completely
overwhelmed right now.

136
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,173
There's a teenager here
who's having problems,

137
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,575
long hair, delicate, delicate.

138
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,477
So I think it's a demon.

139
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,647
And this demon is really messing
with the girl,

140
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,850
acting like a woman,
crawling into the bed

141
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,686
and...

142
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,423
touching feeling, cuddling.

143
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,492
It's evil.
It's so **** evil, though.

144
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,628
It's so **** evil.

145
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,002
All right, Donna,
why'd you bring me upstairs?

146
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,270
What's the story?

147
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,039
I was,
sleeping one night, woke up,

148
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,242
and I couldn't breathe,
like I was being choked.

149
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,610
And I couldn't move.

150
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,014
And Abbie woke up and she kept
sayin', "Mom, mom, mom!"

151
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,184
And it kinda upsets me
'cause she was so scared.

152
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,519
And, um, she said my lips
were turnin' blue

153
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,154
and my face was swelling.

154
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,590
- You sure it wasn't a dream?
- Yes.

155
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,292
Do you think whatever's here
wants you here?

156
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,328
No, especially not up here.

157
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,063
This is<i> their</i> place.

158
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,398
And now whatever's here
forced you guys

159
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,099
into not sleeping up here?

160
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,968
Yeah.

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,369
Okay. Anything else?

162
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,105
Yeah. I see an apparition
of a-a man.

163
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,373
It's all black.

164
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,142
Um, he's --
he's very tall.

165
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,344
The only thing I do see
that's not black is his --

166
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,581
is a pale --
pale, yellow eyes.

167
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,784
And he has a long, um,

168
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,686
hairy, Grinch-like fingers.

169
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,287
The way you describe,
it's something out of,

170
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,422
like, a horror movie.

171
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,058
It's kinda like his --
like an owl.

172
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,559
I know it sounds crazy.

173
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,595
Any medications
you're taking for the --

174
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,231
the symptoms you're havin'?
- Mnh-mnh. No.

175
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,466
Okay. The only reason I ask
is because I don't know

176
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,734
if you're hallucinatin'
what you're seein' or...

177
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,169
Right.

178
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,437
I would think that, too.

179
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,173
- 'Cause it's pretty bizarre.
- It is.

180
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,841
All right.

181
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,678
The demon went through the wall.

182
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,816
And then it, like, morphed into,
like, a creepy face.

183
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,484
Like, grotesque.

184
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,653
Not only can this demon
project itself

185
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,288
to look like anything it wants,

186
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,225
it's also able to affect
the living in horrible ways.

187
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,861
I can't breathe.
I feel, like, choking.

188
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,197
I think the demon's
making people kill each other

189
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,466
or kill themselves.

190
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,469
This place is ****.

191
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,037
Is anything else goin' on?

192
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,338
Well, I hear, um, um,

193
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,807
a female voice
calling my name.

194
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,109
'Cause this always
usually happens

195
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,877
when I'm at home by myself.

196
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,612
And it --
it scares me to death.

197
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,447
Are there any females
other than you in the house,

198
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,515
other than Abbie?

199
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,951
Mnh-mnh. No.

200
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,686
TV on, anything like that?

201
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,988
No, I had all the TVs
turned off.

202
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,590
Well, you got
your hands full.

203
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,459
They definitely
don't like us here.

204
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,961
They don't want us here.

205
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,829
I think
they just want us gone.

206
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,135
There's a woman there,
and she's just staring at me.

207
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,469
She scares me.

208
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:36,174
She scares me
because she's<i> so</i> not okay.

209
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,044
She's crawling on the floor.
She's crying.

210
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,346
She's screaming. She's yelling.
She's in pain. She was hurt.

211
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,448
I don't know what's
goin' on here.

212
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,817
My god. I'm so scared.

213
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,185
The dead have been
**** here.

214
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,820
You know, it's not good.

215
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,190
They can't move on.
It's really bad.

216
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,726
I think the dead here
really do think they're in hell.

217
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,130
It's so not good.

218
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,219
So, Andy,
this is your master bedroom?

219
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,721
- Correct.
- Okay.

220
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,357
Well, this is the first house in
over 100 cases I've ever been in

221
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,258
where the bedroom set wasn't
even set up.

222
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,128
So what you're tellin' me is
that stuff was so bad up here

223
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,629
that you guys
didn't even go as far

224
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,732
as even putting the bed
together?
That's right.

225
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,100
Now where -- where do you
specifically sleep?

226
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,870
Downstairs, in the recliner.

227
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,138
So, Andy, I was talkin'
to your wife,

228
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,506
and she was tellin' me about

229
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,508
everything she's going through,
plus the kids.

230
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,510
It makes me feel terrible.

231
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,846
You want to protect 'em.
You -- you want to be there.

232
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,115
But, um, it just seemed like
ever since we've been

233
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,818
in this house, it's just been
one issue after another.

234
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
The kids don't like
to come upstairs.

235
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,757
Now, Andy, have you had
any of the experiences

236
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,492
that your wife
and the kids have had?

237
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,027
Well, there's a few things
that's happened.

238
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,828
I've heard noises,

239
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,998
like, maybe something
falling off of a counter.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Then I go and check on it,

241
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,102
and, you know, don't --
don't see anything.

242
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,439
So I just kinda discount it.

243
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,774
Anything else happen?

244
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,675
Severe room temperature
changes.

245
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,644
The hallway will be
one temperature.

246
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,913
You come into this room,
it's like a meat locker.

247
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,748
What time of the year
were you feeling this?

248
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,350
Well, it was during
the summer.

249
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,119
Did you shut off the vents
or anything in this room?

250
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,522
No, they hadn't been.

251
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,991
That's strange.
Anything else?

252
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,592
Since we started remodelin',

253
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,195
I started, you know,
havin' trouble breathin'

254
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,297
and my back started hurtin'
really bad.

255
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,167
And then I had kind of
a tightness of the chest.

256
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,169
Now have you felt that
any place else in the house?

257
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,336
No, I haven't.

258
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,072
- What about at work?
- No.

259
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,673
It hasn't happened
to you since?

260
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,642
- No, hasn't.
- That's kinda strange.

261
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,678
I believe something
attacked me.

262
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,750
You're kinda ****
anywhere in this house.

263
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,888
This is just
where it's most active.

264
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,460
I think that area's
like a portal.

265
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,762
- What does that mean?
- It's a doorway.

266
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,332
It's for dead people,

267
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,635
connects outside.

268
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,105
Other houses are affected.

269
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,173
Something's happening
in my stomach.

270
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,218
So, Tyler,
I was talkin' to Mom.

271
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,453
She said you basically
grew up here, correct?

272
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,621
Right. Yes, sir.

273
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,022
- How old are you now?
-21.

274
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,559
Now what about yourself
as far as experiences go?

275
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,396
Feeling, you know,
drained all the time.

276
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,532
Sleeping for 12 hours

277
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,735
and feeling like I've only
gotten two. So...

278
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,805
Your father mentioned
chest pains and back pains

279
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,206
and stuff like that.

280
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,575
Are you having any kind
of health issues?

281
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,011
The stabbing pains in my back.

282
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,847
I'll -- I'll be in the bed
and I won't be able to,

283
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,250
for about 5 minutes,
be able to get up.

284
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,518
It just hurts.

285
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,888
One second I'm fine,
and then the next,

286
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,156
extreme pain.

287
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,224
I did over six tests,

288
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:17,695
and they said they had no idea
what would be causin' the pain.

289
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,197
What do you think
is goin' on here?

290
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,099
You think it's paranormal
that's causing your issues?

291
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,236
Without a doubt. I've seen
too many things not to.

292
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,538
All right. Anything else?

293
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,641
The one night I was laying
on Abbie's bed,

294
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:34,579
I saw a black shadow figure
block out the TV.

295
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,917
It was like a real tall,
stocky man, had yellow eyes.

296
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,985
And then how long does
he hang out?

297
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,823
Three, for seconds, looks at me,
and then disappears.

298
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,392
To this day, it haunts me.

299
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,695
All right. So that's in Abbie's
room where you saw this.

300
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,330
I mean, you gotta be scared

301
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,532
that she may be seeing
the same damn thing.

302
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,502
And you know,
it -- it upsets me

303
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,872
because for something
to go after her...

304
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,474
you know, any --
any time I would say,

305
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,145
"Come after me.
You know, don't go after her."

306
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,582
I'd take her place any day.

307
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,851
If you had a choice of living
here or not, what would you do?

308
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,154
I'd go as far away
from this place as I could.

309
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,526
I don't like it here.

310
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,262
This is a bad room.
This is a very, very bad room.

311
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,799
I'm seein', um...

312
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,103
They're in the walls.
They're in the walls.

313
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,272
And they're hidin'
in the **** walls.

314
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,076
And they are...bad.

315
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,880
People see these.
- Like, how many?

316
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,251
There was probably, like, five.

317
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:51,823
They are slitherin' around
on the walls.

318
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,658
They're physical.
They're physical.

319
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,093
Um --

320
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,363
Mother ****, mother.

321
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,810
So the property records
on this place

322
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,212
go all the way back
to the mid-1700s.

323
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,680
In fact, the first family

324
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,116
who settled on
Donna and Andy's property

325
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,252
got the land grant
from King George III of England.

326
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,254
Amazingly, I managed
to track down a descendant

327
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,956
who still lives in the area,

328
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,391
and he says he's got a story

329
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,792
that will definitely
help my case.

330
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,467
So, Caroll, I understand
that you are the descendant

331
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,669
of the original owners
of my clients' property.

332
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,871
Yes. I'm the --
the fourth great grandson

333
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,773
of John Caldwell,
who's buried here.

334
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,509
This -- this is
his original marker.

335
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,844
So from what I understand,
you told me

336
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,846
he was granted the land
from the king?

337
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:53,784
Yes. He was granted
250 acres in 1772.

338
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,552
So my clients' house
is on the original property.

339
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,787
That's correct, yes.

340
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,921
Now you had mentioned to me

341
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,490
that there was
a pretty interesting story

342
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,724
in regards to your family.

343
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,292
Yeah, John Caldwell,

344
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,428
he eventually ended up
fighting on the side

345
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,563
of the American Revolution.

346
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,399
There was a person
in this area

347
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,534
who was on the side
of the British.

348
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,570
And he was called
"Bloody Bill" Cunningham.

349
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,639
He was a terror
in this part of the country.

350
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,275
He killed many people,
in this area

351
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,511
who were loyal
to the colonists.

352
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,547
In November 1780,
Bloody Bill Cunningham

353
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,316
captured
John Caldwell's younger son,

354
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,052
who was 14 at the time,
hacked him with swords,

355
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,789
scalped him, and left him lyin'
on the side of the road.

356
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,624
That's a brutal way to go.

357
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,593
He lingered till morning and --
and passed the next morning.

358
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,330
And he is the first person
buried here in this cemetery.

359
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,371
I'm seein' an older man.

360
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,773
He's taking a boy, I think.

361
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,444
He's pushin' his face
to the floor,

362
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,212
kickin' him.

363
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,114
"This isn't how you act!"

364
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,283
Kickin' him.

365
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,085
This is residual.

366
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:06,423
The teenage boy's
in trouble.

367
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,660
He's, like,
maybe 15, 16 years old.

368
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,464
So much anger
between these two people,

369
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,600
between the kid
and the -- the adult,

370
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,769
so much **** anger.

371
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,171
I know that
that man was influenced.

372
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,606
What's doing that?

373
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,241
The demon.

374
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,214
Something's wrong.

375
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,350
Feel like somebody's
being stabbed in the stomach.

376
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:37,588
I feel like a young male
is being stabbed in the stomach.

377
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,494
I gotta know more
about this Bloody Bill guy.

378
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,162
I'm on my way
to meet a genealogist

379
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,431
who says not only
did he terrorize the city,

380
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,500
but he ended up
killing someone else

381
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,968
who lived
on my client's property.

382
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,677
So, Suzanne, this guy,
Bloody Bill Cunningham,

383
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,279
I understand he was
a bit of a psycho

384
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,514
that killed a lot of people.

385
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,415
- That's true.
- What do you know about him?

386
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,184
He was born
in South Carolina,

387
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,552
and he grew up in a family

388
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,988
that was loyal
to the British crown.

389
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,123
And this is a portrait
of Bloody Bill.

390
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,095
Looks pretty regal
in this photo, doesn't he?

391
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,265
So how's this guy
turn into a bloody killer?

392
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,800
At the age of 19,
he decides

393
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,604
to go against his parents'
loyalty to the crown

394
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,974
and join with
the American colonists to fight,

395
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,478
with the one proviso
that he not be required

396
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,947
to kill or go after
his family.

397
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,348
Okay.

398
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,552
Well, a few months after going
with the American colonists,

399
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,087
he's asked to do
just exactly that.

400
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,390
He's asked to go after
his family.

401
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,391
Okay. So what does he do?

402
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,993
He refuses. He resigns.

403
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,229
And his commanding officer
and some others

404
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,198
went looking for him 'cause they
weren't happy with the decision.

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,769
And they found his parents
and his younger brother.

406
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,771
They roughed up his parents

407
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,839
and whipped his brother
to death.

408
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,441
Wow. Okay.

409
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,209
So now I can see where this
guy's anger's startin' to build.

410
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,313
Yes. He gets together
a group of men,

411
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,416
and he starts out
on a rampage to get even.

412
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,252
They traveled through
the countryside burning homes,

413
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,255
killing people, looting.

414
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,724
- So how bad was it?
- He killed at least 50 people,

415
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,659
including
John Caldwell Junior,

416
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,294
who lived on
your clients' property.

417
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,997
I just left his grave site.

418
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, so at some point,
this Bloody Bill gets stopped?

419
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,403
In 1782, he was banished
from South Carolina

420
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,106
and fled to Nassau
in the Bahamas.

421
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,475
- What happens to him there?
- He died there,

422
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,778
about the age of 31,
in 1787.

423
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,347
Any cause of death?
Do we have any idea?

424
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,450
Some suggest
that he died of T.B.

425
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,485
- Good. He deserved it.
- Yes.

426
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,823
Do you have any idea

427
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,925
how long these shadow people
have been here?

428
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,227
I would just say forever.

429
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,196
And this demon thing?

430
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,231
Forever.

431
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,066
Do you have an idea
what they want?

432
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,702
The shadow people are
**** killing people here.

433
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,104
And I think the demon's

434
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,606
**** makin' people kill
each other or kill themselves,

435
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,341
****, you know?

436
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,482
This is bad land.
It's bad.

437
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,083
It's not good.

438
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,253
This, activity

439
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,156
does go, pretty far back.

440
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,692
It goes this way
and it goes this way.

441
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,895
And other houses
are being affected.

442
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,097
This is where the dead roam.

443
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,434
Everybody's wanderin' around.
Everybody's wandering.

444
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,336
It's like chaos.
It's not good.

445
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,605
Dead people feel
like they're in hell.

446
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,413
If you need us to investigate

447
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,314
unexplained activity
in your home,

448
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,384
go to the "The Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

449
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,253
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story,

450
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,454
And we'll help if we can.

451
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,039
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

452
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,508
on a property
where Bloody Bill murdered

453
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,778
one of his 50 victims,
the child of a former owner.

454
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,015
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

455
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:20,919
Searching through old records,
I find two mysterious drownings.

456
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,487
Turns out,
they happened in a quarry

457
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,691
right on my clients'
original property line.

458
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,627
I'm heading over to meet
the sheriff of Spartanburg,

459
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:30,896
who's gonna tell me
exactly what happened.

460
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,405
So, Sheriff, I came across
those two drownings

461
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:43,174
in my research
that happened in the quarry,

462
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,877
a little over a mile from
my, clients' property.

463
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,079
So what can you tell me
about the first victim?

464
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,215
Mr. Henry Oglesby

465
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,717
was a 14-year-old male
in good shape.

466
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,387
He ran track.
He was healthy and athletic.

467
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:58,023
This is a photo here
of Henry Oglesby

468
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,492
at -- at the age of 14.

469
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:04,062
He was at the rock quarry
and decided to go swimmin'.

470
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,964
This was
a very popular hang out.

471
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,799
He jumped in the water.

472
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:10,135
And I don't know
what height he jumped from.

473
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,803
He never resurfaced.

474
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,306
I can't imagine the heartbreak
his parents felt

475
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:16,441
losing
a 14-year-old like that.

476
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:19,077
All right, so what do we know
about the other drowning?

477
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,113
Yeah, August the 6th of '89,
almost 2 years.

478
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,316
A David Wayne Ellison,
25 years old.

479
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:27,552
Same -- same deal, ha--
hanging out with his buddies.

480
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,021
Two guys jumped in,
one came out.

481
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:33,992
And we find him
in about 17 feet of water.

482
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:35,393
So now you got

483
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,331
two pretty able-bodied,
strong guys drowning?

484
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,665
Right.

485
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,234
Okay.

486
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,105
I'm hearing, like,
"Don't go in the pool."

487
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:54,512
And I saw a shadow person
go in the **** pool.

488
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,749
"Ya think it's safe over here,
but it's not."

489
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,518
What do you think would happen
if people go in the pool?

490
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,356
I think that,
they might drown.

491
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:05,924
I think that the shadow person

492
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,692
that hangs out
in the **** pool

493
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:08,960
would try to drown people.

494
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:12,063
- Like how?
- It'd pull their feet.

495
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:15,133
Not safe, not safe,
especially kids,

496
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:16,801
really dangerous here
for children.

497
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:20,071
Really not good for kids here,
not good at all.

498
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,008
I come across another case

499
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,343
that you might find interesting
near your clients property.

500
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:27,212
There was a murder
that took place there

501
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,914
on October the 31st, 1990.

502
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,350
- At the quarry?
- Yes, sir.

503
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,718
Okay,
so what exactly happened?

504
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,955
It's a gentleman by the name
of Ramone Hernandez.

505
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,190
Mr. Hernandez is
24 years old.

506
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:43,395
This next slide is, photos
of the two convicted killers.

507
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:45,330
This gentleman here
on the left is --

508
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:47,599
his name is
Charles Steven Sink.

509
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,200
And his girlfriend,
Ellen Holcolm,

510
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,303
who have both been convicted
of murdering Mr. Hernandez.

511
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,873
Okay. He's got a smirk
on his face.

512
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,242
All right, so how did
the murder go down?

513
00:23:57,244 --> 00:24:00,078
Hernandez, gentleman who was
suffering from a brain tumor

514
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,347
and had a very small amount
of time to live,

515
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:05,250
he had a settlement, a large sum
of money in his pocket.

516
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:08,453
And, these two took him out
under the disguise

517
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:11,823
that they were gonna go party
and have some fun.

518
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,359
This Sink guy had
a- a cocaine problem.

519
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,794
You know, he's needin' money.

520
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:17,862
And he hits Hernandez
in the back of the head...

521
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,931
- Right.
- With -- with the back of an ax.

522
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,033
So not to really cut him up.

523
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,235
And they tried
to cover their actions

524
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,303
by throwing him into
the quarry

525
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:28,006
and make it look like
a drowning.

526
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,941
He and her both had planned this

527
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,843
to make it look like
an accident.

528
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,245
All right, so how much money
did these two get?

529
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:37,615
We know $700
that they took off this man.

530
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,417
All right, so this homicide
happened over 25 years ago.

531
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,652
Are these guys still in?

532
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,921
- Sink got out in 2013.
- Okay.

533
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:46,591
And, she got -- she got in
or around the same time,

534
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:49,694
but has, reviolated
and gone back.

535
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,897
Wow, so I got a murder
that pretty much took place

536
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,499
and the body dumped
in that same quarry

537
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,167
where these two kids drowned.
- That's right.

538
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,573
There's a man.

539
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:05,677
I get he's young,
probably late teens.

540
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,446
I feel like someone
is after him.

541
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:11,015
He's getting beat up.
He's being beaten.

542
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:17,288
I see two people around him,
one is a tall, chubby man.

543
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,824
I get the name Steve.

544
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:21,092
This dude

545
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:24,129
who's hurting this kid
is in his 30s or 40s.

546
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:27,065
So this is recent, 1990s.

547
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,468
It's dark. It's dark where
they are, no lights.

548
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,671
He is crying and praying
and begging for his life.

549
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:37,509
And I hear him yelling,
"Not here! Not like this!"

550
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,117
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

551
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,553
but the demon projecting
itself is an old woman

552
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:52,090
to a living child
had me the most concerned.

553
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,594
This negative,
evil thing is coming up.

554
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,931
And it's wrapping itself
around her,

555
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,569
acting like it's good,
but it's really evil.

556
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,438
Next, I described how the demon
showed itself to me.

557
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,108
It was very disfigured.

558
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,076
And it was reaching out.

559
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:16,414
And it had these long,
dagger-like teeth.

560
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:20,318
Is this what you saw?

561
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,022
Yes.

562
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,494
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

563
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:47,796
we're ready
to reveal our findings

564
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:51,333
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

565
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,468
So, Amy, this may look
like a living room,

566
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,870
but we're actually doing
the reveal right in the middle

567
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,340
where everyone
in this house sleeps.

568
00:26:58,342 --> 00:26:59,841
It's that bad.

569
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,777
This is Andy, his wife, Donna,

570
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,313
her son, Tyler.

571
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:09,084
Also...

572
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,053
they have a son, Austin,
who's 15,

573
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:15,457
and their daughter, Abbie,
who's 11.

574
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,525
Now Abbie's the reason
we've been called in.

575
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:20,629
Donna believes whatever's here
is picking on her

576
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:23,164
and she's afraid Abbie
could be in danger.

577
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,466
Now that Amy knows a little bit

578
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,067
about who you guys are
and the rest of the family,

579
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:28,203
I'm gonna ask her to describe
her walk for us.

580
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:35,043
One of the first things that
came through very, very clearly

581
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:39,414
was a disturbing residual scene
I saw involving a young male.

582
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,750
I got that he was
in his late teens.

583
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:43,885
He was extremely frightened.

584
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,688
He felt like he was
going to die.

585
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,657
Somebody was after him.

586
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,492
It was dark out
at this time.

587
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,662
He was crying and praying

588
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:55,997
and begging for his life.

589
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:59,334
He was saying, you know,
"Not here! Not like this!"

590
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:03,772
He was being beaten,
by two individuals.

591
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:07,976
And the one that I really,
got a look at was tall.

592
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,611
He was chubby.

593
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,013
I did get the name "Steve"
with him.

594
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:14,649
And I got that this was
a fairly recent attack,

595
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,886
possibly 1990s.

596
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:22,524
That sounds a lot like
some, case

597
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,459
I came across on my research.

598
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:27,328
A mile from here, you guys have
a rock quarry, um,

599
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,998
that used to be part
of the original property.

600
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
Back on Halloween night, 1990,

601
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:35,303
a young guy named
Ramone Hernandez was down here

602
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,938
with two of his friends --

603
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,444
Charles Steven Sink,
who I happen to have a photo of,

604
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,879
middle name Steven...

605
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,652
...and his girlfriend,
Evelyn Holcolm.

606
00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:55,056
Now Ramone had terminal cancer,

607
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,691
recently cashed
a disability check

608
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,493
and had a lot of money on him.

609
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:01,162
His so-called friends
took him to the quarry

610
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,997
and suddenly attacked him.

611
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,733
They knocked him unconscious.

612
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:09,037
And Holcolm and Sink pushed him
into the quarry.

613
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,172
- Why'd they do it?
- For the money.

614
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,541
Ramone has $700 in cash on him.

615
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,477
Cops wind up figuring it out.

616
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,611
They got a hold of these two,

617
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,480
and they wind up confessing
to it.

618
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:20,949
Sink spent 23 years in prison
and he got out.

619
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,050
He's out now. He's alive.

620
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,686
Now Holcolm got out
after a few years,

621
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,654
but is back in jail
for another offense.

622
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,356
Do you think that's what
you might have been seein'?

623
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,725
Well,
it sounds just like it.

624
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,168
The next thing was that I...
came into the house

625
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,771
and I saw this male.

626
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:45,173
He seemed extremely angry.

627
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:48,009
He was hurting people
in his life.

628
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,411
One of the things
I thought was

629
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:55,283
that you might
hear him walking around.

630
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,485
Everybody in the house
hears footsteps, correct?

631
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,154
Yes.

632
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,189
I hear footsteps
going up and down,

633
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:02,490
up and down, up and down.

634
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:04,025
That's him.

635
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,934
I got that he would
occasionally touch women,

636
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,537
possibly,
inappropriately.

637
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,007
I also got that he spends
a lot of time right here.

638
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,444
So in this room,
you may feel nausea and anxiety.

639
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,846
A lot of what you're sayin'
is what these guys

640
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:26,581
are experiencing.

641
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,616
Explain your health issues
to Amy.

642
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,352
There's lots
of different health issues,

643
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:34,889
kidneys and gall bladder,
back,

644
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,725
and just tired all the time.

645
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,227
Since we've moved here,
I've di--

646
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,229
been diagnosed
with a heart condition.

647
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:44,566
I've had stabbing pains

648
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:47,969
and back pain all the time.

649
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,538
Now this might explain
why we were called in.

650
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,207
Abbie has developed

651
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:55,643
an anxiety disorder
called selective mutism.

652
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,613
Any time she's feeling
threatened or anxious,

653
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:02,717
she's not able to tell me 'cause
she just -- she shuts down.

654
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:05,320
Interesting. Okay.

655
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:09,757
Typically,
on a normal investigation,

656
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,528
I will come across,
you know, one thing

657
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,598
that is of major importance
at a location.

658
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,967
You, in fact,
have several.

659
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,641
I actually came across
a portal.

660
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:28,977
It's upstairs
at the end of the hall

661
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:31,079
before you go into
the big room.

662
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:35,416
And what this is,
is a doorway for the dead.

663
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:37,151
The dead that were coming
through this

664
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:38,319
were indicating to me that

665
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,054
they literally feel like
they're stuck

666
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,456
and that they're stuck
in hell.

667
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:45,894
So let me get this straight

668
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,095
So there's a portal here,

669
00:31:47,097 --> 00:31:49,230
the dead could come
from just about anywhere?

670
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:51,199
Yeah.

671
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:55,370
And there are a lot of people
that are coming through.

672
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,072
I'm sorry...

673
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:03,111
All these horrible things
that happened around this area,

674
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:04,679
that were negative,

675
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:08,549
are being sucked in here.

676
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,884
It tears me up.

677
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,887
I wished it was me
that was experiencing

678
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,889
as opposed to them.

679
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,228
The other thing
that's coming in

680
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,865
with all of these lost,
dead people roaming about

681
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,601
was upstairs in the hallway.

682
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:30,672
And it was shadow people.

683
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:34,943
And they were slithering
flat on the walls,

684
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:38,079
up and down
and on the ceiling.

685
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,282
These things have been here
for a very, very long time

686
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:43,985
and have somehow
figured out a way

687
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:48,756
to cross over from
possibly another dimension.

688
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:55,363
They are extremely dangerous.

689
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:59,100
They tend to center
their anger

690
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,236
around children,
the elderly,

691
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:05,740
and individuals
who are sick.

692
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:10,111
Now Tyler here, tell Amy
about the shadow figure you see.

693
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,513
It feels like
it's about 7 foot tall.

694
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:14,983
- Okay.
- And it's peering down on me.

695
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:16,751
And it has yellow eyes.

696
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,786
Really. Okay.

697
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,723
I see something,
like he says, very tall

698
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:23,791
with pale, yellow eyes.

699
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,228
And he's got these long,
creepy fingers.

700
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,398
It makes me think
that I'm goin' crazy.

701
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,166
Now Abbie sees them also,
right, Donna?

702
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:34,535
Right. That's something
that shuts her down.

703
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:35,803
It scares her.

704
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:40,641
If she's seen half the things
I've seen, then...

705
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,643
I can't imagine.

706
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,779
All right, so what do
these shadow figures want?

707
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,814
They want to abduct
or they want to kill.

708
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:52,020
I don't want you guys
goin' in the pool,

709
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:55,390
especially the kids,
because when I was outside,

710
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:58,092
I was seein' this shadow person
goin' into the pool.

711
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:00,428
And I saw that thing,

712
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,697
like, people swimming
and then yanking them down

713
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:07,435
by their feet
and tryin' to drown 'em.

714
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:11,606
Now this house sits on
what used to be a 250-acre farm.

715
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,441
And in the middle of that farm
was that huge quarry

716
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:15,009
where the murder took place.

717
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,611
The other thing I found out
about the quarry

718
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:17,945
is that two young people

719
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:22,316
drowned there under
very mysterious circumstances.

720
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:24,752
First kid was
on August 22nd, 1987.

721
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:28,389
A 14-year-old boy
by the name of Henry Oglesby

722
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:31,526
went swimming there
with some friends.

723
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,762
And I got a picture of Henry
right here.

724
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:36,364
He jumped into about 10 feet
of water

725
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,133
and he never came back up.

726
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,035
Almost 2 years later, in 1989,

727
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,272
a 25-year-old by the name
of David Wayne Ellison

728
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,207
did the same exact thing.

729
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,677
He went swimming, jumped in,
and never resurfaced.

730
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,247
These were
two healthy young men.

731
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:55,817
Now you said these shadow people
are all over the damn place.

732
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:59,120
Yes.
Is it possible they could have
caused these kids to drown?

733
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:02,557
I think so.

734
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,825
There's actually been cases

735
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:05,726
where individuals
have seen shadow people

736
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,831
and then have had things
like heart attacks.

737
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,466
The feeling of lethargy

738
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:15,903
because they will literally
suck the breath out of you.

739
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,540
Now that I hear it,
it's all fitting together.

740
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:22,977
I've had more
breathing problems, you know,

741
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,212
um, like that.

742
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,814
So, I mean, it -- it's just...

743
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,416
it's concerning.

744
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,451
Now, Amy, Andy might
be downplaying things,

745
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:34,222
but he was doing renovations
and got seriously sick.

746
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,458
It's bad. I think he was
attacked up there.

747
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,229
And he hurt for over a week.
He likes to play it down.

748
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:42,630
Now do you think that's from
the shadow people?

749
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:43,798
Or is that somethin' else?

750
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,567
That's more than likely
the shadow people.

751
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:47,935
Like, slowly,
they're draining,

752
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,439
literally taking the life
from you.

753
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,907
We're being held captive.

754
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:54,542
Yeah.

755
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:03,651
The biggest threat in your house
is a demonic presence.

756
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,721
It's very powerful.

757
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:08,222
One of the individuals
that I got

758
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:12,226
that it's influencing
was in the pink room.

759
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:13,561
That's Abbie's room.

760
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:16,564
I got that there was
a lot of issues

761
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:19,033
with the person in that room.

762
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:22,303
And that this thing
is really essentially

763
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,771
at the root of that problem.

764
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:25,973
And all those fears
and traumas

765
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:30,211
that are taking place
are being created by this thing.

766
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:32,046
It can change forms.

767
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:34,182
There's a lot of trickery
and faces it can take.

768
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:37,318
Where's it at? I mean, is it
here with us, in the house?

769
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,155
Or is it...
- Yes, it is.

770
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,824
I feel -- I had a feelin'
that it was.

771
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,726
So I'm not crazy.

772
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,228
No.

773
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,198
One of the sketches
that I had done was

774
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,136
of a moment when it was
tricking the living person

775
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:59,073
into thinking it was
a deceased relative.

776
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:10,051
Jeez.

777
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:21,362
It looks just like Abbie.

778
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,197
It makes me so mad.

779
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,832
I should've
done somethin' sooner.

780
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,538
I'm worried.

781
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,941
So now this is not how the demon
looked when you saw it, right?

782
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:36,010
So what did it look like
when you saw it?

783
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:38,145
I had a sketch done.

784
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:39,847
Another one? Okay.

785
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:45,519
God.
Well, this would scare
the **** out of me,

786
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:47,255
I'll tell ya that.

787
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,829
That's my -- that's my room.

788
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,833
At night, I saw the --

789
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:02,169
I saw it completely black out
the TV in my room.

790
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:04,472
It was him lookin' down at me.

791
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:07,275
It scared me to death. It took
the color out of my skin.

792
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:10,478
And till this day,
I- I don't forget it.

793
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,215
So, Donna, is this
the yellow-eyed thing you saw?

794
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,550
Yeah.

795
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,019
All right, so what does
this thing want?

796
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:21,555
I feel like, the, demon

797
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:24,525
has really attached itself
to Abbie.

798
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:28,129
And I think it's already

799
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:31,732
influencing her
to become depressed,

800
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:34,635
um, possibly harm herself.

801
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:38,973
And you guys aren't the first
to be influenced by this thing.

802
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:41,676
That sucker's<i> old.</i>

803
00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:43,244
It upsets me, makes me mad

804
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:45,846
that something could
have that power, you know,

805
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,848
to do that.

806
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,252
That fits right in with what
they do -- self-harm,

807
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:54,288
harm to others,
divide and conquer.

808
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,059
It makes me just want
to put the family in the car

809
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,360
and not come back.

810
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,367
Now every once in a while,
a client has a portal,

811
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,668
and that's bad news.

812
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,237
Shadow people come up even less,

813
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,573
and that's usually
really bad news.

814
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,141
This is the first case
I've worked with Amy

815
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:33,812
where you have a portal,
shadow people, and a demon.

816
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,680
Honestly, I have no idea
what she's gonna say.

817
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:39,651
But unfortunately, I got
a feeling you won't like it.

818
00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:47,258
As we were going along,
I'm like,

819
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,561
"Well this could be done
or that could be done."

820
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:54,999
And then, I went upstairs
to talk to the positive dead.

821
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:59,737
And what they said, very loud,
very clearly, was, "Move."

822
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:07,178
There's several things
that you would need to do

823
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,880
prior to moving.

824
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:13,451
You would need to have
a type of exorcism

825
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,320
of Abbie.

826
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:18,523
I don't recommend exorcisms
for -- for children,

827
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:21,960
um, but this is
absolutely necessary.

828
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,329
So the next thing
that needs to be done

829
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:27,198
is a blessing
for the entire family

830
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,635
before the move,
by a holy person.

831
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:36,875
And then all three of the kids
should see a psychotherapist.

832
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:39,744
There's a lot of PTSD
that's going on here

833
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,579
of things that they've seen.

834
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:42,947
They're gonna be terrified

835
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,183
that this is something
that's gonna happen again.

836
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:47,151
Do you think that that's...

837
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,921
this thing has probably
caused her condition?

838
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:51,689
Yes.

839
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:57,128
And I think her seeing
a psychotherapist will help.

840
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,998
I feel bad for puttin'
my children through this.

841
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,567
I feel like
I've let it happen.

842
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:08,773
Um, and then also,
I cannot believe it.

843
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:12,043
You gonna do what
Amy suggests you guys do?

844
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:14,112
- We'll move.
- Okay.

845
00:41:14,114 --> 00:41:16,681
Wishing we would've
done it earlier.

846
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,416
I'm willing to do anything.

847
00:41:18,418 --> 00:41:19,884
Well, the thing is,
you're gonna have a fresh start

848
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:21,519
and get your kids back.

849
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,054
You can live in a tent.

850
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:25,690
What-- whatever you need to do,
as long as your family's safe.

851
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,493
As long as I still have them,
that's all that matters.

852
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,895
Right.

853
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:33,398
Between a demon, a portal,
and shadow people,

854
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,634
the only way Donna and Andy
can protect their family

855
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:39,370
is to move as far away
as possible.

856
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,607
If they do that and exorcise
the demon attached to Abbie,

857
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,343
they should lead
a peaceful life.
