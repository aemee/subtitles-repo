1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,692
It's just filled with darkness.

3
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:16,483
I think the house is gonna kill us.

4
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,152
He was bad.

5
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:21,184
I kept my guns loaded. Big mistake.

6
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:24,156
Definitely seeing blood on the floor.

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,926
He should have broken his neck.

8
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,647
- What?
- Really strange stuff.

9
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:33,888
It's like a freaking madhouse.

10
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,558
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,272
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:40,474
Something is not right.

13
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,608
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,777
This person might have
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,546
I speak to dead people...

16
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,448
I get those chills.

17
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,782
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,251
He is darkness. He is evil.

19
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,254
There's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,903
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,491
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,595
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,096
Tellin' me the truth?

24
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:06,200
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,834
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,336
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,863
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,940
But Steve and I never speak.

29
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:14,908
We never communicate
during an investigation...

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,276
Until the very end.

31
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,644
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,613
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,915
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,083
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,684
It was like endless darkness.

36
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,137
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

37
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:55,879
I dig into the property's dark
past with interviews and research.

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,020
While Amy communicates with the dead.

39
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:05,673
I'm in Starks, Maine. It's a small
town about 45 minutes from Augusta.

40
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:08,259
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Ann Marie.

41
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,096
She says things in her
house are out of control.

42
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,946
Everyone is sick all the time,
things are starting to get physical.

43
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:18,978
And that whatever's there is
picking on her elderly parents.

44
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,959
I'm hoping Amy and I
can help this woman out.

45
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:34,766
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

46
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:39,837
This home has a lot of religious icons
that need to be covered or removed.

47
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:45,738
Once they're cleared, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

48
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,962
Nothing here is sacred.

49
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,931
- Ewe.
- What?

50
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,712
It does not feel good in here.

51
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,478
A lot of...

52
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:26,339
Anger here.

53
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,500
There's so much fear and
anger, like, huge, huge.

54
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,493
So, Ann Marie, I know you
sounded pretty concerned on

55
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:52,484
the phone about what's
going on in the house here.

56
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,442
You live here with your
parents, is that correct?

57
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,255
- Yes.
- And how old are they?

58
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:59,033
My mother is 74. My father is 79.

59
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,366
- And how long have you lived here?
- 13 years.

60
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,902
Give me a little bit of
a rundown what's going on.

61
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,599
There's a lot of sort
of unexplained noises.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,602
We've seen things.
People have been touched.

63
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,881
You're here 13 years. Why
are you calling us now?

64
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:15,790
It seemed like things
started getting worse.

65
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,543
People are getting attacked.

66
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:21,548
All three of us, our health has gone
downhill since we moved into this house.

67
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,656
I have breathing problems now.

68
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,752
All three of us have developed
kidney problems since we lived here.

69
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:30,164
What makes you think your health
issues have to do with the paranormal?

70
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:32,058
Because it's too much of a coincidence.

71
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,929
We see something or we
have some kind of encounter,

72
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,464
and then, all of a sudden,
somebody has a new health issue.

73
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:41,957
Like, within days of an encounter.

74
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,603
Do you know any history about the house?

75
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:48,254
We found out a few months
after we moved in that um...

76
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,990
A woman had killed herself here.

77
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,662
Do you know who that person
was or any information on them?

78
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:58,484
It was the person who we bought
the house from, it was his wife.

79
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,176
What are you hoping Amy and I
can do for you and your parents?

80
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,922
I just want to know what to do.

81
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:06,058
I mean, we keep getting
sicker and sicker.

82
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:11,219
I think the house is
gonna kill us. I really do.

83
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,563
It's just filled with darkness.

84
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,558
I just feel sick.

85
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,333
It's almost like nothing can live here.

86
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:26,234
There's just all these dead people,
and it's, like, all these deaths.

87
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,347
And there's a lot of them.

88
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:34,168
This is their house. This is,
like, the house of the dead.

89
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,936
You said the basement
you don't like at all.

90
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:47,701
No. Before, if I had to,
like, change a fuse or...

91
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,670
I don't even come down
here to do that anymore.

92
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,950
I call my brother-in-law,
make him do it.

93
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,176
I can hear it in your voice.
You sound like you're...

94
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,326
Yeah, yeah. I don't want to be here.

95
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,235
What are you feeling
when you come down here?

96
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:01,373
Every time I'm down here, I
feel like people are touching me.

97
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,924
Like hands are grabbing me from behind
and trying to, like, hold on to me.

98
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,593
And anything else?

99
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:12,450
I was down here one time with my nephew,
and two huge bins of, like, tools...

100
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,524
Fell on me, pinned my leg.

101
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,363
And it wasn't slanted
or anything like that?

102
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:19,199
It was stuff that was
stacked forever, it was...

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,157
It was solid. It never moved.

104
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:23,574
You have any animals down here
that may have knocked it over?

105
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,338
No, the animals never come down here.

106
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,518
Something bad happens every
time somebody comes down here.

107
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,402
Why don't we get out of here and you
show me someplace else in the house?

108
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:35,183
- Okay, okay. Yup.
- All right?

109
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,700
There were people hiding down there.

110
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,319
I want to say they were, like, robbers.

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,050
You know, but one of them was pretty bad,
on the run for a long time... a long time.

112
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:03,951
I know he ends up killing somebody.
He killed somebody down there.

113
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:08,948
I don't see a weapon, so
I'm assuming with his hands.

114
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,389
I think this house is a purgatory place.

115
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:21,109
What's going on up here?

116
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,028
First, it started with just hearing,
like, footsteps up and down the hallway.

117
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,957
Okay, and it wasn't
either one of your parents?

118
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,758
No.

119
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,100
- How often does this happen?
- This is a regular occurrence.

120
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,570
This is my life.

121
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,829
You said on the phone that
you had the house blessed.

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,279
I've blessed it, and I also
took Sage and went around.

123
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,380
- Did it help?
- No. It's like I'm under siege.

124
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:52,385
There are so many dead people.

125
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,766
There's too many. I don't know.

126
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,260
They make it so you can't live here.

127
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:08,124
They, like, run at the door, and
someone in here has blocked them.

128
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,736
So they can't come in all the time.

129
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,981
Well, no, it's just
one of them, I guess.

130
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,446
When she can't get in,
she acts like an animal.

131
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,948
Who is this?

132
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,906
One of the weird dead people.

133
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:22,252
So, is that something
that might be heard?

134
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,173
Yeah.

135
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,987
Is there anything else?

136
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:31,108
There's a woman, an apparition, that
comes and stands in that doorway.

137
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,761
Okay, describe her for me.

138
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,614
She's kind of shadowy,
like, kind of black.

139
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,470
- She's only about this tall.
- Okay.

140
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,839
And she looks kind of like a black mist.

141
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,509
- How long she last?
- More than half an hour.

142
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,858
- What?
- Yeah. She just stands there.

143
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,123
- Stares at me.
- For a half hour?

144
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,445
That's the first time in all
these investigations I've ever

145
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,334
heard anybody tell me more
than a couple of seconds.

146
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,134
I've walked through her.

147
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,843
I've come up the stairs
now three or four times,

148
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,759
and as I turned the corner, she
was there, and I walked through her.

149
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,061
Feels like the life's
being sucked out of you.

150
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,935
And the first time it happened...

151
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,930
The next day, I got
this breathing problem.

152
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,251
That nobody's been able to figure out.

153
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:20,767
The dead, in here, would be
perceived probably as shadow people.

154
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:24,212
They're all over.

155
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:27,032
I don't know. They're
saying they smother you.

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,093
They smother them up.

157
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:33,115
I can't breathe.

158
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,622
What's going on here?

159
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,966
My father fell down these stairs.

160
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,001
Okay.

161
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:47,103
He was coming out of the
bathroom, like, right out here.

162
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,848
He ended up down there.

163
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,780
He said he went down
headfirst backwards.

164
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:54,611
- Okay, was his feet wet and everything?
- No.

165
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,480
- No dizzy spells or anything?
- No.

166
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,915
What did he say happened?

167
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:02,964
When we got to the hospital, he
said that somebody pushed him.

168
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:05,716
- Did you believe him?
- Oh, yeah, I believed him.

169
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,057
I mean, he should have broken his neck.

170
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,426
It's terrifying.

171
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,061
We had to move his bed from downstairs.

172
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:14,782
- After this incident?
- Right.

173
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:25,069
I'm just seeing these weird images of,
like, dead bodies, but they're warm.

174
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:28,597
They crowd around the house.

175
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:32,642
And they're like, if we don't get
any rest, nobody gets any rest.

176
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:35,307
And they do move strangely, too.

177
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:38,640
- How do they move?
- Like zombies.

178
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:42,841
And they're like, oh, just you wait.

179
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,669
So, Adam, I was talking
to your aunt Ann Marie.

180
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,698
She told me about the stuff that goes
on here, now, did you spend time here?

181
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:15,745
- Yeah.
- Okay.

182
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,112
- I spend a lot of time here, actually.
- Okay.

183
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,481
She's had a lot of experiences.
What about yourself?

184
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:24,189
I've definitely felt
very uneasy around here.

185
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,638
There's a lot of, like, kind
of weird vibes and energy.

186
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,701
You know, it's kind of in the air.

187
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:34,065
I've seen things that
I can't exactly explain.

188
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,816
- Like what?
- Halloween of 2011...

189
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:41,319
I was playing kind of superstitious
games with my ex-girlfriend.

190
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,437
And one game is called
Bloody Mary, where you...

191
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:48,126
You say the words Bloody Mary
into a mirror three times.

192
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:52,205
And we were holding a cross in our hands
to the mirror just because, you know,

193
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:55,584
I was kind of superstitious and
didn't want anything to happen.

194
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,619
Then, the cross just got a little
bit colder and a little bit colder.

195
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,522
And finally, we just set
it down, put the lights on.

196
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,484
It was very shocking.

197
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:05,682
Let me get this straight.
Were you doing that here?

198
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,856
- Yeah.
- Where?

199
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,929
- Upstairs.
- In which room?

200
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,062
In my aunt's room.

201
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,064
Does your aunt know about
this cross thing you did?

202
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah. She's not happy.

203
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,638
- You blame her?
- No.

204
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,744
Okay. You know, I think your
aunt had a right to be mad at you.

205
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:22,825
- Yeah. I think so, too.
- Yeah, so, she's a sweet lady, so...

206
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,333
- I know. I love her very dearly.
- Okay.

207
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:29,982
I'm very much regretful of it
now. I'm very superstitious.

208
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,655
Anything else you
might have pulled here?

209
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,656
- That nobody knows about?
- Not here, no.

210
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,908
You think you caused all the
problems that are happening?

211
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:40,218
I don't know what exactly
to think about all of this.

212
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,218
But it does seem that way.

213
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,651
Thinking about all the events
and tying them together,

214
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:50,684
I'm just really, like, scared
that maybe I'm responsible.

215
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:54,412
I mean, I kind of tried
to make up explanations.

216
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:57,277
I always try to believe in
a higher power, you know?

217
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,986
God and something that's good
and loving and protecting.

218
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:04,526
And if there's something negative
and wishing ill upon my family,

219
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,225
I'm very upset about that.

220
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,259
Right.

221
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,822
You know, it does sometimes feel
like we're up against something.

222
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:15,080
And I don't know... I don't want
to say that definitively, but...

223
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,961
I'm scared of it.

224
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:26,131
There's just some
weird [Bleep] going on.

225
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,855
Really strange stuff.

226
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:36,901
There's, like... somebody's doing,
like, all these seances and stuff.

227
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:40,926
But there's... but they
shouldn't be, and they know it.

228
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,587
Someone religious is doing it.

229
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,998
Steve, I was talking to
your sister-in-law Ann Marie.

230
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,647
And she was telling me about the
stuff going on in the house here.

231
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:56,447
Yeah.

232
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,654
She mentions you come over
once in awhile to help out.

233
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,371
You got to be concerned for your in-laws
I would think, and your sister-in-law.

234
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,888
I'm always concerned
because they've all been ill.

235
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,057
I've always sort of
worried about them here.

236
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,259
So, since you spend time here,
have you had an experience?

237
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,265
I have had some sort of uncomfortable
feeling about the house at times.

238
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,173
Okay. Any place in particular?

239
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:21,289
Well, in the basement, when
I was bracing up the shower,

240
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,276
the next day, I contracted kind of a
numbness throughout my hands and shoulders.

241
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,379
So, did anything go wrong
when you were working?

242
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,567
Nothing that I could say. It was
just pretty much straightforward work.

243
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,518
My fingers are still
numb for the most part.

244
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,698
- Ever since that one time you've been...
- Ever since that time.

245
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,457
It's been three months.

246
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,188
Have you been to a doctor?

247
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:45,062
Yeah, I've been to several.
They're not sure exactly what it is.

248
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:46,796
Okay. Anything else?

249
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:52,217
Sometimes, it feels like there's,
like, a darkness that settles.

250
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:57,437
It felt like there was a leaning toward,
you know, being more argumentative...

251
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,638
More negative about things in general.

252
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:07,579
These dead people... they
don't want to talk to me.

253
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,579
They know...

254
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,805
Exactly why the [Bleep] I'm
here, and they do not want it.

255
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:18,546
They are like, get the
[Bleep] out of here.

256
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:24,452
Thick... they're thick. They're
pretty [Bleep] strong, man.

257
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:28,168
The amount of dead people in
this house is overwhelming.

258
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,264
I have no idea why they're all here,

259
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:36,165
but they hate living people and
have disturbing ways of showing it.

260
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,869
A very emotional house.

261
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,079
Do you mean that it
affects people's emotions?

262
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,680
I would think that it might.

263
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:48,794
Because it's a very angry...

264
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:51,311
Fearful house.

265
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:57,212
Everybody's confused in this place.
It's like a freaking madhouse.

266
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:17,211
Ann Marie told me she thinks a
woman committed suicide in her house.

267
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:20,332
I did some digging, and
her story checks out.

268
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,852
I was actually able to
locate the victim's husband,

269
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:28,753
and as painful as it is, he's agreed
to tell me exactly what happened.

270
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,746
Well, Ron, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

271
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,780
You're welcome.

272
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,659
I'm so sorry to hear
about your wife, Mary.

273
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,850
Yeah.

274
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:45,106
- I assume you still...
- I think of her a lot.

275
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:46,961
Okay.

276
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,722
She was my Mary.

277
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,492
This is her right there.

278
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:59,281
She had a serious bone
disease in her back.

279
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,604
And leading up to her suicide,
her condition got worse?

280
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,070
Yes, it did.

281
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:09,150
Her back was really deteriorating.

282
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:13,714
Now, can you, if it's okay with
you, tell me about what happened?

283
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:19,615
Well, how I remember it, I had
to go to the V.A. hospital...

284
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:24,343
And uh, I came home.

285
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,915
My dog was going bananas.

286
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,525
And I found her in the dining room.

287
00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:34,649
On the floor, and there was blood.

288
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,790
She had shot herself with my 30-30.

289
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:40,294
Wow.

290
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:44,136
I kept my guns loaded, and
I showed her how to use them.

291
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,537
Big mistake.

292
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:51,731
I should have never
left her alone, but...

293
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:54,461
- And I know you must feel guilty about it.
- Oh, yes, I do.

294
00:17:54,462 --> 00:18:00,362
When I left that morning, I never
said, goodbye, or, I love you.

295
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,738
The dead that are here...
they'll just make you miserable.

296
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,959
Miserable.

297
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,228
I just feel like a lot...

298
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:19,672
There was a lot of bad things
that hap... like, consecutively.

299
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:21,604
Like what?

300
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:26,585
Like I am definitely
seeing blood on the floor.

301
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:32,528
Definitely seeing blood on the floor.

302
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:39,734
Someone's like, yeah, people
met a lot of terrible ends.

303
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:45,974
Now that I know someone committed
suicide on my client's property...

304
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,619
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

305
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,862
So I hit the books at the local library.

306
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:57,208
And the only other death I can
uncover is a guy named Angier Gray.

307
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:02,249
Turns out he died in my
client's home in 1935.

308
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,551
I want to find out if
there's any more to his story.

309
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:11,176
I'm on my way to meet with a
local historian who says Gray's

310
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:17,077
time in Ann Marie's home was
filled with heartbreak and loss.

311
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,546
So, Ernie, during my research, I
came across this guy Angier Gray.

312
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:28,213
What can you tell me about him?

313
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,725
Angier was a pretty prosperous guy.

314
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,733
He was involved in a lot of
businesses... store keeping.

315
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,661
He was a farmer.

316
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:41,562
In fact, here's a photo of Angier
with his granddaughter Caroline.

317
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:45,664
Was he sick? Because he
looks a little emaciated here.

318
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:49,762
Well, that's what years of
hard work will do for you.

319
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:53,195
So, now, you had mentioned on the phone
that he had some tragedies in his life.

320
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:54,730
What were you talking about?

321
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,773
Angier had been given
the farm by his siblings

322
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:00,736
after his father died
but with a condition.

323
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:05,374
He had to support his mother
and his brother George.

324
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,601
Who was mentally disabled.

325
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:12,830
But there was actually a bit of
difficulty between George and Angier.

326
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:17,691
And in 1911, George
physically assaults Angier.

327
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,422
He leaves.

328
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:22,420
Angier closes the door and
never allows George back.

329
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,482
Wow.

330
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:27,822
And Angier was estranged
from the family after that.

331
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:30,197
Now, do you know what he died of?

332
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:35,058
He died in the house you're investigating
of apoplexy, which is a stroke.

333
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,826
Ernie, let me ask you a question,
I know a lot of people were buried

334
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:41,128
on the property they lived on back
in those days, what about Angier?

335
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,512
He wouldn't have been buried there, but
there is something you might want to know.

336
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,740
It's that the house that
you're investigating...

337
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:51,925
Is either adjacent to or encroaches
on an old village burial ground.

338
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,386
Really? Okay.

339
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,046
There was this man...

340
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,807
And he was mean.

341
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,982
A very mean person.

342
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,041
He's, like, pasty, and...

343
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:13,207
He looks like an undertaker just...

344
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,188
Nasty.

345
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:17,626
But he's very here.

346
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:20,741
Like, he's very much
a part of this house.

347
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:26,596
It's really strange because I think
he was kind of deserted by his family.

348
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:28,517
Okay.

349
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:34,884
He's all alone.

350
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,825
He was bad.

351
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:57,164
Ernie said my client's property is
either built on or next to a graveyard.

352
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:00,742
This could be a huge
development in the case.

353
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:06,643
I'm on my way to interview a local
cemetery owner to see if it's true.

354
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:17,289
So, Paul, is it true that
the house I'm investigating...

355
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,489
There might have been a graveyard either
under it or at least right next to it?

356
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,448
Yes. That's true.

357
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:26,828
In fact, my great-great-great-grandfather
was originally buried there.

358
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,664
He died in 1822.

359
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:32,234
And he was reburied in this cemetery.

360
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,878
Now, let me ask you a question.
What was a reason they got moved?

361
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,366
There was a concern about water
contamination of the public well

362
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:42,495
that was immediately across the
road from the graveyard site.

363
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:45,980
Okay. Now, did they all
get moved to this cemetery?

364
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:50,731
No. They were moved to a variety
of cemeteries around the town.

365
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:53,094
- Some were moved to this site.
- Okay.

366
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:56,479
But there were others in
several other cemeteries.

367
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,359
All right, so, when did this take place?

368
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,778
Well, we know the
cemetery was there in 1860.

369
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,901
I have a map here of
the village in 1860.

370
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:09,500
And you can see there's
a cemetery marked

371
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,790
adjacent to the home that
you are investigating.

372
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,801
Right, this is the corner, and this
is the cemetery right here, okay.

373
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:20,322
And this is an 1883
map of the same area.

374
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,717
And you can see there's
no cemetery at that site.

375
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:25,741
Okay. So, we know it had
to happen between that time.

376
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:26,765
That's right.

377
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:31,226
So, how did the moving process work? I
mean, did they just dig the body up and...

378
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,428
Well, they did in some cases.

379
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,304
And in other cases, the bodies may have

380
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:39,482
not been relocated, may
still be in the ground there.

381
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:43,307
There have been a number
of bones allegedly found

382
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:48,408
at the site where this
old burial ground existed.

383
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,001
Somehow, these people are dying here.

384
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,496
Or...

385
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:58,777
Died here?

386
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:03,234
It's their home. It's their place.

387
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:09,841
These dead people are...

388
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,412
Like, none of them are okay.

389
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,591
There's too many of them, and...

390
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,960
They're too sick and too much...

391
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,229
Death, and...

392
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,797
Like you can't escape their pain.

393
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,938
There are so many people's thoughts.

394
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,073
It just is not good.

395
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,358
If they did leave the body there,
what was the reason for that?

396
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,394
Well, possibly couldn't find it.

397
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,042
Some of these bodies might not
have had any headstones with them...

398
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,590
- Originally.
- Okay.

399
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:46,761
In other cases, the families
may have been too poor

400
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:50,564
to pay for the cost of exhuming
the body and relocating it.

401
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:53,119
This cemetery was a
privately owned cemetery.

402
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,569
It was not owned by the town.

403
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,672
So, this was a private decision
obviously with community support.

404
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:02,649
- Because of the water supply issue.
- Okay.

405
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,124
So, if a family member
decided, well, you know what?

406
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:08,340
I don't have the money or the
means to have the body moved,

407
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,124
even though they moved the cemetery,
the bodies could still be there.

408
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,087
That's true.

409
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:14,558
Now, would they ever move a
headstone and not the body?

410
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,029
Yes. Headstones are easy to move.

411
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,393
Bodies are much more difficult.

412
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:24,673
And some of the bones were,
in all likelihood, left behind.

413
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:29,894
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

414
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't think that they were very
well taken care of when they died.

415
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,596
They were saying, um...

416
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:44,491
You know, that they are like the true
lost souls, the ones that people have...

417
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:48,992
Forgotten about or
turned their backs on.

418
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,609
They were discarded.

419
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,910
They're discarded people.

420
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:06,018
I encountered dozens of
dead people during my walk.

421
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,867
But what has me the most concerned,

422
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:12,741
is the bizarre scene I saw
in the downstairs bedroom.

423
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:17,782
You could see their eyes,
like, in the darkness.

424
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,663
And there were three on each side and
then the three or four that came forward.

425
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,516
To talk to me at the end of the bed.

426
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:31,077
And they all had,
like, thick, long hair.

427
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:36,746
Is this what you saw?

428
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,854
Yes.

429
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:04,718
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

430
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:09,759
we're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

431
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,230
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Ann Marie and her nephew Adam.

432
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:17,875
Ann Marie actually lives
here with her elderly parents.

433
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:21,798
She believes that whatever's in this
house is making them all very sick.

434
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,246
And is possibly trying to kill them.

435
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:28,035
Adam's very close to his family
and is worried about them,

436
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:31,895
but he also believes that he may
have caused what's going on here.

437
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:37,796
So, with that being said, I'm gonna
ask her to describe her walk for us.

438
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,132
This was the first time on a walk

439
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:45,553
that I almost didn't make
it all the way through.

440
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,033
I almost left.

441
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:50,452
I was overwhelmed with how many dead...

442
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:53,064
Were located here.

443
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:56,531
This is a house of the dead.

444
00:27:56,532 --> 00:28:01,692
It's like a purgatory or
a way station for them.

445
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,674
How many dead people are here?

446
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,615
Over 20 in the house and, like...

447
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:10,098
- God.
- Maybe like 30 or 40 outside.

448
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,188
I may have an explanation
for why you saw so many dead.

449
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:16,835
This house is either built on or...

450
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,157
Literally right next door to
what used to be a graveyard.

451
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:20,463
Wow.

452
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:23,284
I got two maps...

453
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:27,069
Here, this one is from 1860.

454
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:34,385
And it shows a cemetery right
here along their property line.

455
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:37,921
Now, I have another map from 1883...

456
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:42,062
That shows the cemetery's not there.

457
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:46,687
- It makes sense.
- So, you all right with that?

458
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:51,868
I mean, I don't know if you can be all
right with a purgatory of dead people.

459
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:56,443
There's just so much stuff they didn't tell
us about this house before we bought it.

460
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:02,344
- I'd be really mad about that were I you.
- That just really, really pisses me off.

461
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:06,899
There's one male that's here.

462
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,360
And he is...

463
00:29:09,812 --> 00:29:12,032
Not okay.

464
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:17,397
He's, like, pasty, and he
looks like an undertaker...

465
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:19,738
Just nasty.

466
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,751
He just seemed extremely unwell to me.

467
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:29,089
But he was very much
estranged from his family.

468
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,620
I might be able to maybe give
you an idea of who it could be.

469
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:39,106
There was a guy named Angier Gray
that lived here from 1917 to 1935.

470
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:42,827
I've got his death certificate.
He lived and died in this house.

471
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:47,208
He died of apoplexy, which is a stroke.

472
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:52,465
He lived on a farm with his mother
and brother not far from here.

473
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:54,457
When you said he was
estranged from the family...

474
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,022
Angier had to take care of
his younger brother George,

475
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:58,613
who was mentally handicapped.

476
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:01,866
But George got into a physical
fight with him and left the house.

477
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:05,620
And Angier never let him back in.

478
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:09,008
That's where the estrangement
comes with the family.

479
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,891
You said the guy reminded
you of, like, an undertaker.

480
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:15,732
- Yes.
- This is how he looked.

481
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:22,481
Amy, do you think this
is the guy you saw?

482
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:24,679
Yeah.

483
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,758
Do you think that this man in
particular is actively trying to harm...

484
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,712
Everyone here?

485
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,582
He's contributing.

486
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:37,653
His emotional state of
being, loneliness, anger...

487
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,670
That radiates out.

488
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,814
Can we be influenced by him?

489
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:46,195
I think that's a huge possibility, yes.

490
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,930
What else is going on in this house?

491
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:53,410
The basement, there was...

492
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:55,767
Four people.

493
00:30:55,768 --> 00:31:00,470
One of the guys from downstairs told me
that all of them were hiding from the law.

494
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:02,147
He told me he killed somebody.

495
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,858
I think he did it with his hands.

496
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,105
Oh, my God.

497
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:09,391
Now, the thing is you got a cemetery
that was here from the 1700s.

498
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:11,812
There's no records on
who was buried here.

499
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:14,648
I do know that no murderer
lived in the house.

500
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:18,270
But that doesn't mean that he
might not have been buried here.

501
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:20,163
You don't like to go
into the basement I could

502
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:22,786
barely get you down
there to interview you.

503
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,956
I always feel like
someone's grabbing me.

504
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:25,772
Okay.

505
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:30,798
Like, it feels like I'm
being attacked from behind.

506
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,383
Adam, can you tell Amy
what physically happened to

507
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,609
your father after he did
the work in the basement?

508
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,145
He began to have a lot of
muscle pain in his arms,

509
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:42,805
and his wrists and his hands, and
he couldn't move his hands anymore.

510
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,446
And no doctor can figure out
what the hell is wrong with him.

511
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,250
Yeah.

512
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,912
Every time someone goes in
the basement, they're ill.

513
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:53,173
Somebody gets ill or hurt right after.

514
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:56,253
I don't want to deal
with negative energies.

515
00:31:56,254 --> 00:32:00,054
It's bad enough having people among
the living that are jerks, you know?

516
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:03,542
Well, the dead in this house
are very angry for a reason.

517
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:08,388
They felt that the living had turned
them away and turned their backs on them.

518
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,904
And that they were not well
taken care of when they died.

519
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:18,059
They feel like they're true lost
souls and that they cannot be saved.

520
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,828
This is where I can probably help
you out with why they're so angry.

521
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:26,254
Now, when the cemetery was moved,
a lot of bodies were left behind.

522
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:31,602
Back then, the family would
have to pay to move the body.

523
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:34,600
A lot of people didn't have the money,
so they ripped the headstones off,

524
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:38,921
and their bodies were just left behind.

525
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,069
What else did you see?

526
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,950
I was seeing seances down here
trying to communicate with the dead.

527
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,380
Several of these people
over the years knew that they

528
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:57,075
really should not be doing
this, but they did it anyways.

529
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,130
Remember when I told you,

530
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:02,873
that Adam feels he may be responsible
for what's going on over here?

531
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,195
Adam, why don't you tell
her what you told me?

532
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:09,320
On Halloween of 2011,
me and my ex-girlfriend,

533
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:14,291
we were, you know, just playing around,
doing, you know, spooky Halloween things.

534
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,531
And in the upstairs bedroom,
we played Bloody Mary.

535
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:20,235
Yeah, I know what Bloody Mary is.

536
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,960
A lot of the dead feel here,

537
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,180
you know, the disrespect feeling
like they're in purgatory.

538
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,935
There's a lot of animosity here,
so don't blame yourself for that.

539
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:34,779
I feel more of a clear
conscience that it's not me,

540
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,138
but I feel terrible about these
people who feel like they're outcasted.

541
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:40,679
- Yeah.
- Right.

542
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,329
Also, in the upstairs bedroom...

543
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,869
The dead... they couldn't
get into the room.

544
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,872
The interesting thing was
I saw, like, a barrier up.

545
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:54,551
One particular dead person, who's a
female, she gets crazy, and she'll, like,

546
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:58,879
act like an animal and run down the
hallway and, like, try to get in the room.

547
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,378
And the dead woman was pissed.

548
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,468
Wow, that freaks me out.

549
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:10,056
Because I Saged all the rooms
upstairs, and I did do a blessing.

550
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:14,130
So, her Saging upstairs, could that have
been what stopped the woman from coming in?

551
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,795
- Mm hmm.
- Are they mad at her for that?

552
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:18,656
Yes.

553
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:23,903
I did do a sketch of the
dead down here in this room.

554
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:26,099
They really unnerved me.

555
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,200
They were congregating...

556
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,044
And it was all around the bed.

557
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,178
Oh, my God.

558
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,948
And that's where Ann Marie's dad sleeps.

559
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,929
Right.

560
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,230
Just don't freak out. But just...

561
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:52,631
Oh, my God.

562
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:02,806
These are the people who
feel lost, who feel discarded.

563
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:06,333
They're very angry, and unfortunately,

564
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,982
they're trying to become,
like, these inhuman creatures.

565
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,711
Now, one of the main reasons,
her breaking point for calling

566
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,456
us in is an incident that
happened here with her father.

567
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:18,790
Tell her what happened.

568
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:23,293
My father was coming out
of the bathroom, and he...

569
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,664
Fell down the stairs
backwards headfirst.

570
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,153
Oh, my gosh.

571
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:30,949
And when we got to the hospital...

572
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,008
He said he was pushed.

573
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:37,045
Seeing him in that state
and seeing all the bruises,

574
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:41,912
and all the trauma it caused,
it was just really awful.

575
00:35:41,913 --> 00:35:44,987
Could they have pushed
her father down the stairs?

576
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:47,388
I think so.

577
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,344
Tell her about what you see upstairs.

578
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:54,696
In my doorway of my bedroom,
it was definitely shadowy.

579
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:56,794
I think it's a woman.

580
00:35:56,795 --> 00:36:00,957
Never crosses the doorway
but stands and stares.

581
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,087
And I mean for like
30 minutes at a time.

582
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:04,335
Mm-hmm.

583
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,037
And then, I have walked through her.

584
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,407
It feels like it kind of
sucks the life out of me.

585
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:12,525
The day after I walked through her...

586
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:14,795
- I came down with a breathing problem.
- Okay.

587
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:17,304
That they have not been able
to figure out what it is.

588
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:20,579
- Probably the one that you blocked out.
- That's horrible.

589
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
What am I gonna do?

590
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:30,695
So, here's how the living might
be affected by the dead here.

591
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:35,234
The dead truly believe that there
should not be living people here.

592
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:39,246
Two things that these guys
do is that they will...

593
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,171
Make you very ill here.

594
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:45,311
And they want to smother you.

595
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:49,746
And that's one of the ways
that they'll try to attack.

596
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:53,605
I can't walk more than 20
feet without being out of air.

597
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:59,306
It's like somebody, like,
kicked the air out of my body.

598
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:04,090
I really feel like this
house is trying to kill us.

599
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:09,163
They told me they won't allow
anything to live here, nothing.

600
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:12,884
It scares me to death, really.

601
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,460
It's so hard to live in this house.

602
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:21,141
Yeah, it just feels
like it never lets up.

603
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:39,277
I really feel like this
house is trying to kill us.

604
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:44,296
They told me they won't allow
anything to live here, nothing.

605
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:47,552
It scares me to death, really.

606
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:49,621
It's so hard to live in this house.

607
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:54,302
Yeah, it just feels
like it never lets up.

608
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:58,567
Now, have you seen anything else?

609
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,714
No. That's the gist of it.

610
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:05,459
Well, there's one major event
that did take place in this house.

611
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,229
There was a woman that lived here in
1997 by the name of Mary Frechette.

612
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,799
She shot and killed
herself right in this room.

613
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,943
So, when I spoke to her husband, Ron...

614
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:19,206
I asked him to explain what happened, he
said he came home from the V.A. hospital,

615
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:22,357
and he found her in a pool of blood.

616
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,557
She had been sick, you know?
Her lifestyle was deteriorating.

617
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,547
So, when you said you
thought somebody had died,

618
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:31,452
you know, committed
suicide, you were right.

619
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:34,872
Any ideas why you
might not have seen her?

620
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:39,374
I just lost a friend recently to
suicide, and he shot himself in the head.

621
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,990
So, that's probably
why I didn't see that.

622
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:45,699
Sometimes, we'll block out
things we don't want to perceive.

623
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,403
Okay.

624
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:49,670
That was just a week and a half ago.

625
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,260
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

626
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:53,601
Yeah. Okay.

627
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,789
That happened.

628
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,493
Okay.

629
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:08,611
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

630
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:21,099
Well, I know you guys have been hit with
a lot of horrific information tonight.

631
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,998
But, Ann Marie, now you
know why your family's

632
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,911
been going through hell
since you've been here.

633
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:28,016
The question is how do you fix it.

634
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:33,917
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to my partner, Amy.

635
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:41,846
What I'm going to say, um...

636
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:46,291
It's kind of difficult for me
because on the one hand I feel...

637
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:51,595
Very sorry for these people, but
they kind of damned themselves.

638
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,068
They've done that via attempted murder.

639
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:58,814
We have to proceed as if they
were some type of a demonic...

640
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,975
Presence.

641
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:07,848
They are not demons, but they
have become a type of evil.

642
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:10,737
The first thing is to move them on.

643
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:14,757
And it has to be a religious,
holy person, so, you know,

644
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:18,478
it could be a minister, a priest, you
know, whatever you feel comfortable with.

645
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:22,151
Sit down with that person, tell
them exactly what happened here.

646
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:25,268
So that they can then
perform whatever...

647
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,640
Religious ceremonies they need to.

648
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,754
This person will move
the good people on?

649
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:32,887
Right.

650
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:38,788
The other thing is is that you are
going to have to have an exorcism done.

651
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,320
Of the land and the house.

652
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,490
Okay.

653
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:55,763
You all right? You didn't want to
hear that word exorcism, did you?

654
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:59,866
I like to believe that
no one is beyond saving.

655
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:04,038
Well, in this case, you got to fight
fire with fire, kid. You know what I mean?

656
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:06,808
They are fully conscious individuals.

657
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,778
They know what they're doing,
and they know right from wrong.

658
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:11,246
And they're hurting my family.

659
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:15,484
And they made a decision, and
that decision is unacceptable.

660
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:17,748
- It scares me because...
- Mm hmm.

661
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:20,355
This is a real thing.

662
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:22,624
It's all very overwhelming.

663
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,596
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:28,788
I'm digging into a bottomless
pit in my heart here.

665
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,727
I... I'm terrified.

666
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:33,022
You're up for the fight?

667
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,386
Yeah. I mean, I'm not gonna let
it kill my family or me, either.

668
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,438
Are you gonna buck up, or
are you gonna sit there...

669
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:42,014
Yeah. No, I'm ready to kill the [Bleep].

670
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:47,895
But let's go in with compassion
and then go for the fight.

671
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:53,782
The entities inside this house will stop
at nothing to torment the living here.

672
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:57,326
But I believe if Ann Marie and
her family follow my advice...

673
00:41:57,327 --> 00:42:03,227
They'll free themselves from the
evil that's been haunting them.
