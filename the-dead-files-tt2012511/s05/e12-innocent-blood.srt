1
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,311
Somebody here is watching them.

2
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:17,357
They just look creepy.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,095
I've been physically touch.

4
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:21,868
Things like touching.
Ooh.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,544
They're cutting apart people
with swords.

6
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,847
I just want a safe spot
for my family.

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,349
I don't want my kids
experiencing

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,717
anything that I have.

9
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,456
They have their sights set
on the children here.

10
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,397
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,566
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:41,604
Something is not right.

13
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,740
I see dead people.

14
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,978
This person might have been
a serial killer.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,815
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,550
You get those chills.

17
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:49,918
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,456
He is darkness.
He is evil.

19
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,327
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

20
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,129
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:58,500
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:58,502 --> 00:00:59,770
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

23
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:02,974
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,309
You telling me the truth?

25
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,413
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,049
I think the devil is down here.

27
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,551
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:11,719
Who the hell would do this?

29
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,155
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,125
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:17,493
...until the very end.

32
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,862
Who's he looking to kill?

33
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,831
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

34
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,136
You need to get out of here
right now.

35
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,305
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,044
It was like endless darkness.

37
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,050
<font color="#00FFFF">The Dead Files 5x12</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Innocent Blood - Rome, NY</font>

38
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:52,464
Amy and I work each case
independently of one another.

39
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,536
I interview living witnesses

40
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:57,341
and uncover secrets
about the property's past

41
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:59,811
while Amy communicates
with the dead.

42
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,424
I'm in Rome, New York.

43
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,463
It's about an hour
east of Syracuse.

44
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:09,699
Amy and I got called in
by a young married couple,

45
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:10,868
Sue and Joe.

46
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,272
They didn't sound very good
on the phone.

47
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:15,543
The activity's so bad
and so physical,

48
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,814
Sue had moved out
with the three kids.

49
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:18,950
But now she's back.

50
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,323
She says if we can't help her
find a way

51
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:24,192
to make the activity stop,
it may end her marriage.

52
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,829
I'm really hoping
Amy and I can help them out.

53
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,905
Before Amy arrives,

54
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:38,079
I clear the area
of any leading information.

55
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,914
Family photos
and other personal items

56
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,015
need to be covered or removed.

57
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:47,218
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

58
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,536
So in my opening,

59
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:07,044
I saw all of these thick trees,

60
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:10,213
and there were all these
native American warriors

61
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,148
standing there
with their bow and arrow drawn.

62
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:20,859
They're waiting
for something to happen.

63
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,329
They were put there
by this leader guy.

64
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:28,967
He says it is some kind of,
like, spirit warfare.

65
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:39,880
He says that there were problems
before the white man,

66
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:44,654
that they had a lot of battles,
many battles,

67
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:47,722
with these spirits.

68
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,731
Sue, you sounded
clearly upset on the phone.

69
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,237
Give me an idea
of what you're going through.

70
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:08,941
We hear banging, knocking,
footsteps.

71
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,111
I've seen apparitions.

72
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,681
I've been physically touched.

73
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,521
I've tried to rationalize
with myself

74
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,490
a million times over again.

75
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,491
I have tried to make up
every excuse in the book

76
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,558
other than it being paranormal.

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,861
Now, do you
believe in this stuff?

78
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,631
What really made me
believe in it

79
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,369
was when
my 8-year-old daughter,

80
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:30,811
you know, she heard people
talking, whispering.

81
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,313
- Is this your kids here?
- Yes.

82
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,048
Now, who's who?

83
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,249
This is Madison.

84
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,184
Okay.

85
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,321
That's Brooke Lynn and Joey.

86
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,858
You had actually left with
the kids at one point, right?

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,693
Yes.

88
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:46,167
I moved out for 11 months.

89
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:50,572
I just couldn't take it
anymore.

90
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,177
They do not like to be alone.

91
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:56,783
- So did you take them out
to protect them? - Yes.

92
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,053
I don't want my kids
to grow up experiencing

93
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:01,889
anything that I have.

94
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:06,863
What made you come back home?

95
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,469
I wanted my family back.

96
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:13,412
I don't want them
to be from a broken home.

97
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,780
But you came back to hell.

98
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:15,781
Yeah.

99
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,451
The same as it was
before I left.

100
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:21,224
Have you guys ever thought
about just moving?

101
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:23,528
That would be last resort
only because

102
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,798
my husband inherited it
from his grandparents,

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,866
so he's got
an emotional attachment.

104
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,773
This native American guy

105
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:37,512
says that there is some kind
of a family of beasts,

106
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:41,576
and they think
that they're ghosts.

107
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:45,815
These things are occasionally
trying to enter the house.

108
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:52,089
They're very dark,

109
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,658
and they look kind of like
human beings,

110
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,296
but they're definitely not.

111
00:05:58,298 --> 00:05:59,831
Were they living?

112
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,735
I don't know yet.

113
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,837
They just look creepy.

114
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,277
Okay, so why'd you
bring me in the kitchen?

115
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,613
Well, we hear knocking
at the door.

116
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,146
Okay.

117
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:19,512
Get up, answer it,
nobody there.

118
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:20,414
Okay.

119
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,584
So, is anything else going on?

120
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:25,022
Banging.

121
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,893
It's a... bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

122
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:29,192
Where does it sound like
it's coming from?

123
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:31,926
The far right corner
of the living room.

124
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,659
If something's wrong
with the pressure in the pipes,

125
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,659
that would bang.

126
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,594
All of our pipes
are in the basement.

127
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,331
And does it happen
at any given time?

128
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,534
Mainly at night.

129
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,236
Well, that's got to scare
the hell out of you.

130
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,603
Startles you.

131
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,235
I mean, you'll jump out of
your skin when you hear it.

132
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:52,540
These things are pretty tall.

133
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,643
How tall?

134
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:56,944
Well, see where
that dent thing is?

135
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,778
About that tall.

136
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,818
Their head kind of jets forward
on a long neck,

137
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,154
and they're hunched,

138
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:09,988
and you can really see
their shoulder blades.

139
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,488
And also, they have, like,
a spine thing that sticks out.

140
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,692
And then really long arms
with the long fingers.

141
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:24,564
It's like a weird dragging sound
against the house.

142
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,937
Do you have any idea how
the living might perceive them?

143
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,038
Making noises
on the outside of the house,

144
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,537
looking in through windows,
growling.

145
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,170
Do you know what they want?

146
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:43,641
They definitely have their
sights set on the children here.

147
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,813
Maybe these are what
the native American warriors

148
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,915
- are fending off?
- Hm.

149
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:56,054
Maybe they are trying
to protect kids?

150
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:06,758
I hear footsteps
walking in here at night.

151
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,561
So it sounds like
it's in the room with you?

152
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:09,462
Mm-hmm.

153
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,131
Okay.
You have the TV in here now.

154
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,599
- Do you keep the TV on?
- No.

155
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,265
And there's no sounds
coming from upstairs,

156
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,999
- like the kids walking around, or...
- No.

157
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,269
Is anything else going on?

158
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:21,475
Aside from being touched
a few times, no.

159
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,678
What do you mean "touched"?

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,313
Well, there was an incident
in the shower one time

161
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:27,913
where I felt like
somebody had rubbed

162
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,312
the outer part of my right arm.

163
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:31,615
And there was another time...

164
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,852
in the living room,
on the couch.

165
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,156
Okay, what happened?

166
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,827
I felt this... grope.

167
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:43,361
So I'm assuming
it was forceful.

168
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:45,296
Okay.

169
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:48,202
Being touched,
it's a violation.

170
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:51,205
Not only for me,
but for my husband.

171
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,372
I will do whatever I have to do
to make sure that my kids

172
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:57,206
do not experience
what I have experienced.

173
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:04,854
They definitely messed
with the boy who lives here.

174
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,623
In this one,
I just hear crying.

175
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:14,763
Crying and things like touching.
Ooh.

176
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:17,600
This is not good.

177
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:18,433
Oh

178
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,768
Like, trying to hide,

179
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,402
and those weird [Bleep]
finger [Bleep] or whatever.

180
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:28,512
He was crying
'cause he was scared.

181
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:32,081
So, you mentioned you
were worried about the kids.

182
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,213
What's going on with them?

183
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:36,782
Well, Joey...
he's more of just...

184
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,786
Scared to go upstairs alone.

185
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,890
Brooke Lynn
also is the same way,

186
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:42,927
but she seems to be
a little bit more sensitive.

187
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,562
She's hearing voices.

188
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:48,828
I wonder if she's being affected
more than I know.

189
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,002
I don't want them to grow up
and be scared.

190
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:56,675
You know, my worst fear
is that they might get worse.

191
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:58,674
This is home to them,

192
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,107
and they shouldn't be afraid.

193
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,716
Well, for some
[Bleep] up reason,

194
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:07,386
dead people come here.

195
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:11,288
I see this dead woman.

196
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,622
She's kneeling on the floor
right here.

197
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,026
She's only one of many...
many of them.

198
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:21,969
I think the creatures here
have never been human,

199
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,602
but now I'm seeing dead people
lined up,

200
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,871
and they're seeking help
from a living person.

201
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:30,680
This person here might have...

202
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:34,084
ohh... an idea
that they are a medium.

203
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:38,318
Dead people
coming to get moved on.

204
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,222
This is not good for them.

205
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,058
No, this kid's got to go.

206
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:05,910
Joe, your wife, Sue,

207
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,344
said that you actually grew up
in this house as a kid.

208
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:11,783
My grandparents used to live
in this house when I was a kid.

209
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,087
- I grew up across the street.
- Okay.

210
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,891
So, I was always over here.

211
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,191
Did you have experiences
as a kid here?

212
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,459
You know,
a couple different times,

213
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,195
but I kind of blew it off as,
you know, it's no big deal.

214
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,933
So your grandparents, I assume,

215
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,972
- the way you're talking now,
they both passed away? - Yeah.

216
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,807
My grandmother passed in 1997.

217
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,308
She had developed emphysema,

218
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,243
and then the emphysema
led to bone cancer.

219
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:38,949
She passed away in the house,
under hospice care.

220
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:39,784
Okay.

221
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,885
What kind of woman was she?

222
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,085
She treated me like, you know,
her little prince,

223
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,152
to be honest with you,

224
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,955
and that's how she always
made me feel.

225
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,960
She made me feel loved.

226
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:54,232
Very kindhearted lady.
Loved to cook.

227
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,698
I mean, I miss her cooking.

228
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,399
You know,
she was my role model.

229
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,103
When Grandma passed on,
it was very hard for me.

230
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,830
I'm getting this older woman.

231
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,368
She was always cooking
and cleaning in here.

232
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,368
She was little.

233
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,203
Tiny, little lady.
Very frail.

234
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:18,443
And she's putzing around,
putzing around.

235
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,981
She's, I don't know, related
to somebody here or something?

236
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,216
Living?

237
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,918
Yes.

238
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:31,425
Now, Joe, when did
your grandfather die?

239
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:35,198
He died September 10, 2001,
the day before 9/11.

240
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,098
Wow.

241
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,367
I'm not sure how he passed on.

242
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,436
There was never
an autopsy done.

243
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:44,475
I think that he had
a massive heart attack.

244
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:47,613
He was a hard-core smoker,
three packs a day.

245
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,715
He actually passed away
right here in the kitchen,

246
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,918
and he was, you know,
dead on the floor.

247
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,419
Okay.

248
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,255
Do you know how old
grandpa was when he died?

249
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,425
75.

250
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,695
Okay, so what kind of a guy
was your grandfather?

251
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,715
He was a Sicilian-American
immigrant.

252
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:05,519
He was very tough, hard-nosed,
old-school Italian.

253
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:07,323
Somebody that I looked up to.

254
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,294
I actually have a picture here

255
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:12,132
of him and I
from when I was a little guy.

256
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,800
Joe, you obviously
knew your grandparents

257
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,701
- better than anybody.
- Right.

258
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,969
Would they want you

259
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,104
to stay here and fight
whatever the hell is going on?

260
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,875
They wouldn't want me
to give up.

261
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,111
Right.

262
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,447
They would want me to fight
for what is mine.

263
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:29,648
And they instilled in me,
you know, you never give up.

264
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,626
I see, like,
some kids running by.

265
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:43,063
A little girl
and, I think, a little boy.

266
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:46,832
They're probably
between, like, 5 and 8?

267
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:50,938
Somebody here is watching them.

268
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,675
I think that this is a male.

269
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:58,513
He's pretty dang old.
He's probably like 70 maybe.

270
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,082
Yeah, I think he's Italian.

271
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:02,519
A heavy, heavy smoker.

272
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,555
He's not a bad guy.

273
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,858
Do you know when he's from?

274
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,397
Maybe he died
in, like, the '90s?

275
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,469
1990s? Early 2000?

276
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,270
Do you know how he died?

277
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,406
I think he had a heart attack.

278
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,041
Maybe it was emphysema,

279
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:25,213
'cause I can't [Bleep] breathe
for [Bleep] from him.

280
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:34,952
So, Joe, what made you
bring me out here?

281
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,321
I was inside, and I noticed,

282
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:39,527
off to the right-hand side,
over here,

283
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,796
there was two mirrors,

284
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,967
and I noticed
that both of 'em cracked

285
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,369
and was just stunned.

286
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,669
Kind of really frightened me,
to be honest with you.

287
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,935
So, did anything hit it that
would have caused it to crack?

288
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,905
There was nothing that
could have been thrown at it,

289
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:53,140
nothing that hit it.

290
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,944
It wasn't broke
when I looked at it

291
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,746
three minutes
prior to this happening.

292
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:59,015
Okay.

293
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,447
Let me ask you a question, Joe.

294
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,282
What are you trying to get
out of our investigation?

295
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,817
What's the best thing
we could do for you?

296
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,153
I don't want the kids
to be affected.

297
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,924
I don't want to have to keep
things from them.

298
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,828
You know, as a dad
and as a father,

299
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,527
I just want to be there
to protect them.

300
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,262
I just want things to stop.

301
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,298
It's been tough
on your marriage.

302
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,870
Yeah, it's been tough.
It's weighed pretty hard.

303
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:24,307
You know, it's tough
to talk about those things

304
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,176
because she means
everything to me,

305
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:30,379
and without her,
I would have no family.

306
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,548
Since she has come back,
you know,

307
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,549
she's been touched and whatnot,

308
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,051
and I just want a safe spot
for my family.

309
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,919
That's all that I want, really.

310
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,732
I combed through
my client's property records,

311
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,201
and as it turns out,

312
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:00,071
a family lived on the land
for 50 years.

313
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:02,842
Most of the time,
this doesn't amount to much,

314
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,511
but I spoke
to a local genealogist

315
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,613
who told me the family
that lived on the land

316
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,784
suffered enough tragedy
to last ten lifetimes.

317
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,299
Kobler family...

318
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:23,636
they lived on my client's
property for almost 50 years.

319
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,739
From about 1874 to 1919.

320
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,508
Now, when we spoke
on the phone,

321
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,478
you said that there
were some terrible times

322
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,747
- on the property when they were there.
- There was.

323
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,685
It all seems to center around
this guy, Henry J. Kobler.

324
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:41,661
It started at the age of 9
when his dad died.

325
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,997
His father
was about 34 years old

326
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,502
and passed away
of unknown reasons.

327
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,837
34 is young.

328
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,706
- It is very young.
- Okay.

329
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,210
And as part
of his father's will,

330
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,846
Henry was actually to be given
to another family

331
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,285
as a valuable farmhand
as a way for the family to live.

332
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,487
I've never heard of that
before.

333
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:05,226
And this lasted for five years

334
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,162
when he was finally returned
to his mother.

335
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:08,530
Okay.

336
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:09,732
But it continues.

337
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,768
In 1901, his grandmother,

338
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,303
who was about 83 years old...

339
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,406
keep in mind, she was deaf...

340
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:18,744
was picking berries one day
on the property

341
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:23,484
and was attacked by a bull
and killed.

342
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:24,852
She was mutilated.

343
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,188
All right.

344
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:33,664
There's this crazy lady
who does run around outside.

345
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:40,340
She's just all over
the [Bleep] place.

346
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,843
And she did die poorly.

347
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,113
What do you mean?

348
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,982
Her head, you know, got...

349
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,319
it got chopped off...

350
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,821
or ripped off, more.

351
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:54,359
It's not a nice, clean cut.

352
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,599
Oh, my gosh.

353
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,335
It's messy, very messy.

354
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:08,144
I'm almost afraid to ask.
What else happened to him?

355
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,614
This is probably
the darkest part of his life.

356
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:14,085
He had a daughter.
Her name was Ella.

357
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:19,893
And in 1920,
she was 16 years old,

358
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:22,664
and she was coming home
from a friend's house,

359
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,434
and she was struck by a car.

360
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:27,404
Wow.

361
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,875
She was an only child.

362
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,677
Oh, geez.

363
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,147
- This guy can't catch a break, can he?
- Correct.

364
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,485
And actually, three years later,
his wife, Fannie,

365
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,389
she passed away
of a botched surgery.

366
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,591
You're kidding.

367
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:46,563
She was having a routine
stomach procedure,

368
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:50,067
and she just died mysteriously
and unexpectedly.

369
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,636
Wow.

370
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:54,407
He ended up passing away
at the age of 67.

371
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,244
The tragedy in this guy's life
is overwhelming.

372
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:08,191
This native American guy
is saying, like,

373
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,094
how it's not safe here.

374
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:12,964
There's no place
that's safe here.

375
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:16,008
Everyone's at risk.

376
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,813
He is saying that, um...

377
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:26,819
that everyone knew
that nobody should be here.

378
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:30,917
That people shouldn't live
in this area.

379
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,753
That it's just for ghosts
to live.

380
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:39,355
So, he just wants to help them
clear the area out.

381
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:41,457
Of what?

382
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,661
Living people.

383
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,175
So far,
I've uncovered multiple deaths

384
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,610
that are directly tied
to my client's property.

385
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,981
But I need to see
if there's anything else.

386
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,818
Digging through old records,
I find the Joslin family

387
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,253
originally owned
the land I'm investigating.

388
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:25,791
Turns out, they suffered a lot
of loss in their time there.

389
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm on my way to meet

390
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:33,666
with a local historian
who did some digging for me.

391
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:35,834
She says she found
some information

392
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,937
that will definitely help
my case.

393
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,446
Now, Mary,
when I did my research,

394
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,281
I came across
a couple of deaths

395
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,749
associated
with the Joslin family,

396
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,252
- but you said there was a lot more.
- There was a lot more, yes.

397
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:55,587
- Okay, how many are we talking about?
- They had ten children,

398
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,423
and four of those children died
as babies.

399
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,126
And then they had
two young adults die

400
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:02,427
from tuberculosis,

401
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,130
which was very prevalent
in that era.

402
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:08,533
Now, Mary, out of the remaining
kids that lived,

403
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,702
did any of them
stay on the property?

404
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,703
Yes, Foster did.

405
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,171
Okay, so what happened
with him?

406
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,540
He lived to be
about 60 years old.

407
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,075
He was a very busy man.

408
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,111
He married at the age of 58,

409
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:23,081
and they had one child,
who died as a baby.

410
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,350
Shortly afterwards,
not even a year later,

411
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,786
Foster dies on that property.

412
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm seeing
those weird creatures again.

413
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,963
A lot of children
they would eat.

414
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,398
I do see, like,
the kids are being bit.

415
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,335
Open their chests.

416
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,938
The leader
of the native Americans

417
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,840
is showing me a horrifying scene

418
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,843
where the tall creatures
by the side of the house

419
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,478
are killing small children.

420
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,913
Kids?

421
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,047
Kids.

422
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,287
It's pretty gross and sad.

423
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,761
In my research, I also found out

424
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,629
that my client's property
was near

425
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,465
the site of a bloody battle
during the French-Indian war.

426
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,901
I'm heading over
to meet with a local historian

427
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,236
at the actual battle site.

428
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,371
He tells me
it was the most violent fight

429
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,639
in the region's history.

430
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,384
This is where the actual
Battle of Fort Bull took place

431
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:36,354
in March 27, 1756.

432
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,689
What was the French-Indian war
all about?

433
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,458
It was between
two superpowers...

434
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,826
the British and the French.

435
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,161
The British
were building forts here,

436
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:48,232
and the French felt that it was
getting too close to their area,

437
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,600
so they sent the men down here

438
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,736
with the Indians from Canada,

439
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,971
and they ended up
surrounding the fort.

440
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,072
And who led these people?

441
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,308
The Lieutenant Gaspard de Léry.

442
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,309
Okay.

443
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,611
And he had with him
the Indian...

444
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,080
Colonel Louis Cook,
who was from Canada.

445
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,883
Okay, so now what went down
with this fight?

446
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,952
- The British were inside this fort here.
- Okay.

447
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,588
The French come up
to the holes in the fort

448
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,223
and were shooting in there,

449
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,557
then they started chopping
at the door.

450
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,659
And finally,
they got through it,

451
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,028
and they're cutting apart people
with swords,

452
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,663
and then they were
scalping them.

453
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,098
Wow.

454
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,299
It was a bloodbath.

455
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,403
The British ended up losing
approximately 60 men.

456
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,373
So, what wound up happening
to the fort?

457
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,575
The French burned it down
with he bodies right in it.

458
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,110
Okay.

459
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:39,817
Somebody says something
about the dead man down there.

460
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,385
I guess they were settlers.

461
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,287
For whatever reason,

462
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,523
they seem to be stuck
down there.

463
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,463
I do see one of them getting
their head bashed in.

464
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:59,569
I think they got ambushed,
were brutally murdered.

465
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,071
Yeah.

466
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,240
Do you know who ambushed them?

467
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,342
I think
it was native Americans.

468
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:16,253
I saw many entities
during my walk,

469
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,388
but two stood out the clearest.

470
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,224
First, the old man
watching over the kids.

471
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:26,296
He was probably 60, 65.

472
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,465
Heavyset.

473
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,002
Very long eyebrows, very thick.

474
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,104
His nose is rather large.

475
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,607
Next, I described
the tall, dangerous creatures

476
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,476
by the side of the house.

477
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,478
It was hunched.

478
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,381
The shoulder blades
were kind of popping out.

479
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:49,185
It didn't have any features.

480
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:57,192
Yes, that's what I saw.

481
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:19,706
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

482
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,574
it's time to reveal our findings

483
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:24,544
to our clients and each other
for the first time.

484
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,679
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Joe and Sue.

485
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:30,350
They're a great,
down-to-earth couple,

486
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,485
but the activity in the house
is ripping them apart.

487
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,454
It's got so bad last year,

488
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:36,789
Sue actually left
with the three kids

489
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,392
and moved out
and stayed away for a while.

490
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:41,761
She's been back
around, what, five months?

491
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,564
Actually, the activity's
gotten even worse now.

492
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,499
They needed our help,
and they want to know

493
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,135
if they can actually stay here
and be safe with their family.

494
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,736
So now that Amy knows
a little bit

495
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:52,405
about what's going on
with you guys,

496
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,407
I'm gonna ask her to describe
her walk for us.

497
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:05,117
When I first opened,
I saw native Americans,

498
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,521
and they had
their bows and arrows drawn,

499
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:11,424
and they were
just in that stance.

500
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:18,464
I got that they were alive
around 1740, 1750s.

501
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:22,568
What they're doing is attempting
to protect the area.

502
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,539
There was some type of...

503
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,309
and still is... some kind of,
like, spiritual warfare

504
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:31,744
going on for them.

505
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:36,148
I met this older
native American man.

506
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,284
What he said
was that this place

507
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:42,421
was not meant
for the living to be in.

508
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:44,690
It is meant for the dead.

509
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:47,726
I'm not surprised you saw
native Americans

510
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:50,863
because the British had set up
a fort on the land here.

511
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,598
It was called Fort Bull
back then,

512
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,737
in March 27, 1756,
the French and Canadian Indians

513
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:01,974
came down here
during the French-Indian wars,

514
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,909
and they attacked the fort.

515
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,511
It was known as
the Fort Bull Massacre.

516
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:07,846
Now, the guy I spoke to said

517
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:09,681
it was probably
the bloodiest battle

518
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:11,817
that was fought
during the French-Indian war

519
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,952
near your property.

520
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:16,688
Now, the native American
you spoke to

521
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,223
said it wasn't safe
for the living here.

522
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,491
No.

523
00:27:19,493 --> 00:27:22,360
Doing the research
on your property, I went back.

524
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:23,795
The first white settlers
on your land

525
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:25,130
was the Joslin family.

526
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:27,566
They settled in the 1840s.

527
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,634
Hosea and Louisa.
They had ten kids.

528
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:32,370
Six of them died.

529
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:38,443
1874, the Koblers
moved into your property.

530
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,046
Most of the tragedy
surrounds a guy named Henry J.

531
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:45,083
I actually got a photo of him.

532
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:49,621
He moved onto your property,
he was about... he was a kid.

533
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:53,925
Three years after he gets there,
his father drops dead,

534
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,960
- 34 years old.
- Oh.

535
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:58,463
In the will, he's willed off
to be an indentured slave

536
00:27:58,465 --> 00:27:59,731
for some other farm family.

537
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,467
- What?
- Took the mother five years to get him back.

538
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:07,172
Now, a few years later, 1901,
on your property,

539
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:09,007
his grandmother, who is deaf,

540
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:13,278
gets gored to death by a bull
on the property.

541
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,147
Next thing you know,
he gets married,

542
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:17,415
lives on your property.

543
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,518
His 16-year-old daughter
is coming home on a bicycle.

544
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,021
- She gets hit by a car and killed.
- Oh.

545
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,655
I got a picture of her.

546
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:28,059
Wow.

547
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:30,528
Three years after that happens,

548
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,931
his wife goes in
for a simple stomach procedure.

549
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:34,932
She dies.

550
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,502
So, it's like
there's nothing but death

551
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:39,804
surrounding this property.

552
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:45,109
Are you surprised to hear
about all this tragedy?

553
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,577
No, not really.

554
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:50,114
The location,
it's not healthy for the living.

555
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:54,919
When I went into the kitchen,

556
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:58,422
I encountered an older woman,

557
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:00,391
and from her specifically,

558
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:02,393
I got that there was
a relationship

559
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:05,262
with someone living
in the house now.

560
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:09,200
She prefers the kitchen area,

561
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:11,635
and then a bit later,
when I went upstairs,

562
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:13,137
I encountered an older man.

563
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:17,541
And both of them seem to have
strong ties to the house.

564
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:20,177
And he was watching
two children playing.

565
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,012
He looked Italian.

566
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:24,615
He was wearing suspenders.

567
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:29,019
He definitely did
a lot of work outside.

568
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:31,622
And when I was around him,
I couldn't breathe.

569
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:35,659
Like, I felt
that he was a very heavy smoker,

570
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:41,632
and he either died
of a heart attack or emphysema.

571
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:44,868
And I think that he died
in the '90s or early 2000s.

572
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,438
I would say that those would be
my grandparents, for sure.

573
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:53,477
Both of them were smokers.
Grandma was a light smoker.

574
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,379
Grandpa was a heavy smoker.

575
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:58,048
Worked construction
his whole entire life.

576
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,019
Grandma's favorite spot
was the kitchen,

577
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:04,121
and I remember,
as a little kid,

578
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,023
Grandpa used to spend
a lot of time

579
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,324
at the top of the stairs.

580
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:10,594
So, for you to say that,
it hits home, big time.

581
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:14,097
So, my grandmother
passed on of...

582
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:16,466
it started with emphysema,

583
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:19,135
and the emphysema
led to bone cancer.

584
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:21,371
- Oh. - And that's what
she passed on from

585
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:22,872
- was bone cancer.
- Oh, wow.

586
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,741
And she did pass away
in the house.

587
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:26,776
Yes, both of them passed away
in the house.

588
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:28,812
My grandfather passed away
in the kitchen,

589
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:31,448
and my grandmother passed away
in what is now our bedroom.

590
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,651
Would it be okay
if I showed Amy their pictures?

591
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:36,119
- Sure, sure.
- You sure?

592
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,554
Yeah.
It's be all right?

593
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:40,256
I'm all right with you sharing.

594
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:41,925
This is his Grandma.

595
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:45,094
Mm. Okay.

596
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:49,632
And this is his grandpa,
and that's him as a baby.

597
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:50,700
Oh, okay.

598
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:54,070
I did do a sketch
of the guy I met,

599
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:59,409
but just sitting up on the bed.

600
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,646
Oh, geez.

601
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,950
That's your grandfather,
trust me.

602
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:12,889
Oh, my gosh.

603
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:24,000
I miss him.

604
00:31:24,002 --> 00:31:27,537
He watches the kids.

605
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,039
I'm just glad to know

606
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,376
that he, too,
watches over the little ones

607
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:36,379
'cause that's how he was with me
when I was a little guy.

608
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:42,151
And this is why
it's so important, really,

609
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:44,220
for Joe to make this house
work for him.

610
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:46,922
He just... he feels like
it's a tribute, really,

611
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,124
to your grandparents.

612
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:50,426
Yeah, and I just feel
that I have to pay

613
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:51,861
a debt of gratitude to them.

614
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:54,997
Okay, I have a few questions.

615
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:58,167
How old are your children,
and what are their names?

616
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,402
Madison, she's 10.

617
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:04,039
Brooke Lynn is 8,
and Joey is 6.

618
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,074
Okay.

619
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:11,347
Um, so...
My walk was very active.

620
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:19,188
So, I'm upstairs, and I went
into the room on the left.

621
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,990
So, I go in there,
and I see a little boy,

622
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:25,227
and he's crying
because there's something

623
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:27,896
in the room,
and it was touching him.

624
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,066
This was obviously
very disturbing,

625
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:32,868
and I don't feel that this

626
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,772
is a very good place
for children.

627
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:39,608
So, I went into the other room,

628
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,211
and what I saw there was, like,
a line of people out the door.

629
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,614
So, initially,
there's this one woman.

630
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:47,949
She's kneeling
at the side of the bed

631
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,185
trying to talk
to this little girl,

632
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:53,021
and she's begging her for help.

633
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,390
And then there's
a line of dead people

634
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,826
out the door
and going down the stairs,

635
00:32:57,828 --> 00:33:01,463
and all of them want help
to be moved on.

636
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:03,698
And the young girl is living?

637
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,733
Yes.

638
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,635
Whether this child
knows it or not,

639
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:07,669
she's a medium.

640
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:11,373
And is actually helping people
in her sleep

641
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,441
to, you know, move on.

642
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:15,977
I Knew it.

643
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,645
That's why this is so hard
on Sue.

644
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:21,383
She actually thinks
Brooke Lynn's sensitive.

645
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:25,186
I know that this is crazy,

646
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:28,556
but Brooke Lynn wrote
this book a couple years ago

647
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,026
out of nowhere that was called
"Blood drops Everywhere."

648
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:34,629
And it kind of scared us.

649
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:37,599
- It was pretty graphic.
- Yeah, okay.

650
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,768
She was probably
in kindergarten, first grade.

651
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,838
I mean, talking about somebody
being stabbed with a knife.

652
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,510
Honestly, it's not unusual
for children who are mediums

653
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:54,649
to act these things out
via dolls or writing stories

654
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,619
that, you know, would be
more appropriate for an adult.

655
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,322
Apparently, she probably knows
more than I do.

656
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,828
You had a lot of stuff
on this walk.

657
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,062
What else did you see?

658
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:09,297
This is, you know,

659
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,066
one of the things
that really bothered me.

660
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:15,002
I saw this thing by the house,

661
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:18,406
and it was, like,
trying to get into the house.

662
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,607
It was odd.

663
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,042
It was very, very tall.

664
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:23,310
It was kind of hunched
by its neck,

665
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,312
but it had a weird, long neck.

666
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,515
It had, like,
a human-shaped head.

667
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:31,185
It just really bothered me.

668
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:33,220
It did not look human.

669
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:36,724
I feel, like,
this draw to the window,

670
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:40,761
and them being outside
and, like, looking in,

671
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:42,296
making weird noises
and scratches.

672
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:46,066
And I could see it had,
like, sharp teeth.

673
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,835
Can they make noises
that they'll hear...

674
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,504
like a knocking...
by any chance?

675
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,939
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

676
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:54,041
- How about banging?
- Yeah.

677
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:57,778
Which we've had numerous,
numerous encounters with,

678
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,413
knocking and banging.

679
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:01,648
Ooh.

680
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,420
- I'm trying to figure out what the hell these
things look like. - Well, I did do a sketch.

681
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:07,955
I'm dying to see this.

682
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,065
Oh, get the [Bleep]
out of here.

683
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:45,405
- I'm trying to figure out what the hell these
things look like. - Well, I did do a sketch.

684
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:46,940
I'm dying to see this.

685
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,816
Oh, get the [Bleep]
out of here.

686
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:12,899
I'm never gonna get any sleep
in that house... never.

687
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:19,973
She doesn't want to look at it,
and I'll explain why.

688
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,574
When was it, last week?

689
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,109
Ugh.

690
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:26,579
Broad daylight,
and she says to me,

691
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:28,614
"did you just see something
walk across the lawn?"

692
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:32,351
I seen its head
up above the porch railing.

693
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,620
A couple days later,
she says to me,

694
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,388
"it must have been
pretty tall."

695
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,263
You know what, babe,

696
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:45,798
I'm gonna turn this around,
all right?

697
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,566
This way,
you don't have to look at it.

698
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:52,104
Let me ask you, what the [Bleep]
are these things?

699
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,039
I don't think
I've ever seen you

700
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,108
sketch something like that
before.

701
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,177
- Were they ever human?
- No. Mnh-mnh.

702
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:01,380
I think that these things
harmed children in the past.

703
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:03,382
- Geez.
- Like, way back when.

704
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:05,117
They're very old,

705
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,353
and they're definitely focused
on your son.

706
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:11,190
I think
it's what was touching him.

707
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,060
Sue's been
physically touched twice.

708
00:37:15,062 --> 00:37:18,096
Describe that to Amy,
what it was like.

709
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:20,766
It was just a rub.

710
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,167
You know, like this.

711
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:23,302
Flesh on flesh.

712
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:24,536
The other one,

713
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:26,438
it's a little difficult
for her to talk about,

714
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,340
but they were together
on the couch,

715
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:30,242
and she was inappropriately
touched.

716
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,944
- Okay.
- There was nobody else there.

717
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,680
It automatically triggered
just pure anger.

718
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:44,222
Joe and Sue, I know you've heard
a lot tonight,

719
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:48,126
and it wasn't easy to hear.

720
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,462
But at least now you know
what's going on in your home.

721
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,530
Big question is, though,
can you continue

722
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:55,033
the legacy
of your grandparents, Joe,

723
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:59,371
and stay here safely
with your wife and children?

724
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,206
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

725
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:10,248
There's a lot going on here.

726
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,684
Especially
because of Brooke Lynn.

727
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:13,818
She's a medium.

728
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,788
So what you're
gonna have there is, like,

729
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,457
a lighthouse, almost,
in your case,

730
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,527
where the dead are coming
to seek help

731
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:24,562
from the living sensitives
in the house.

732
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:28,833
Some of the dead on your
property don't want to leave,

733
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,469
that's why she's gonna need
to learn about her abilities

734
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:33,671
and to feel comfortable
with them.

735
00:38:33,673 --> 00:38:36,741
I would suggest opening
a line of communication

736
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:39,977
with all the kids about
any experiences that they have.

737
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:42,280
My suggestion is,

738
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,148
let them all keep
dream journals,

739
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,249
as well as you guys.

740
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,722
I didn't even mention this
to nobody.

741
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:55,560
Brooke Lynn just said that
a couple weeks ago.

742
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:57,428
She wanted all of us
to get journals

743
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,997
and write our dreams down.

744
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,400
Honest to God.

745
00:39:06,672 --> 00:39:10,741
It's so weird.

746
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:12,576
She wants to talk about it.

747
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:14,445
Sounds like she's
ahead of the game.

748
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:16,046
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

749
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:19,517
All right, the next thing
is the need to protect.

750
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,019
Since native Americans
are guarding your land,

751
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:24,021
I suggest you contact
a local shaman

752
00:39:24,023 --> 00:39:25,289
who can help you remove

753
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,725
the dead that have been
attracted to your property.

754
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,161
In the meantime...
this is black salt.

755
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,163
Take just a little bit of this

756
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:36,900
and put it at the entrance
of each bedroom door.

757
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:39,937
This will create
a protective barrier.

758
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:41,872
The next thing
I would like you to do

759
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:47,911
is to build a stone fence
following that property line.

760
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:50,347
So, this stone wall
you're talking about,

761
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,149
- is this keep the bad out?
- Yeah.

762
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:54,384
Is it gonna keep
that thing you drew out?

763
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:56,253
No, I don't think so.

764
00:39:56,255 --> 00:40:00,424
So, no matter what,
they're gonna be there?

765
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:01,558
Yeah.

766
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,360
Yeah.

767
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:06,463
Well... ugh.

768
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:08,932
You have a potential situation

769
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:12,669
that I personally
have never encountered before.

770
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,174
When I was doing the sketch
of the thing that I saw,

771
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:20,510
I started to get really upset
by it,

772
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:24,080
and the reason why was because

773
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:27,684
I was being told that, in fact,

774
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:30,954
it was some type
of alien creature.

775
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,391
I know, it's a lot.

776
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:37,060
And they're trying,
through subtle ways,

777
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:42,098
to have the living people
get out of the area.

778
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,903
I've never encountered anything
like this in my entire career.

779
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,973
I'm not exactly sure
what these things are

780
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:52,909
or where they're from,
but it's possible

781
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,346
they're from another world
or another dimension.

782
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,715
I can introduce you
to some experts,

783
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:02,318
and it's very possible
that they'll have suggestions

784
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,223
as far as how to keep
those suckers away.

785
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:10,526
What about his grandparents?

786
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:12,762
They're good.
They're gonna hang out.

787
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:13,596
Mm.

788
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,164
What are you thinking about?

789
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:18,034
It's just craziness.

790
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:19,902
It's a lot of stuff, huh?

791
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:22,305
Yeah, no doubt.
No doubt.

792
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:26,576
So, Joe, I got to ask.

793
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:29,112
Are you gonna take Amy's advice
and do what she says?

794
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,280
Absolutely.

795
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,582
I mean, you know,
all I'm looking for as a dad

796
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:37,754
is just, you know,
keep my wife and kids safe.

797
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:39,706
I want to take her advice.

798
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,975
I want to do what we can do

799
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:44,944
to eliminate
all of this chaos...

800
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:52,619
And hope that those creatures
will go.

801
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:56,756
I wish I had better news
for Joe and Sue.

802
00:41:56,758 --> 00:42:00,126
I know if they build a barrier
and work with Brooke Lynn,

803
00:42:00,128 --> 00:42:01,761
their lives should improve.

804
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:04,730
But whether they can continue
to co-exist

805
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,265
with those creatures,

806
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:08,801
unfortunately,
remains to be seen.
