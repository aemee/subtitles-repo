1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,036
It's a huge curtain of darkness.

3
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:16,071
I see a shadow man.

4
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:17,781
He's upset.

5
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,126
I was scared to death.

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,777
- Are you afraid to be here alone?
- It's very nerve racking.

7
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,222
He's gonna try to take her.

8
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:27,793
I want to fix this. I'm desperate.

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,031
They attack her.

10
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:33,812
It can do very physical things.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,070
It's really bad in here.

12
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,873
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,309
Something is not right.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,444
I see dead people.

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,646
This person might have
been a serial killer.

16
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,415
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,318
I get those chills.

18
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,653
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:53,121
He is darkness. He is evil.

20
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:56,058
There's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:57,591
I think she broke her neck.

22
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,161
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:03,464
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

24
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,966
Tellin' me the truth?

25
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:08,069
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,704
I think the Devil is down here.

27
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:11,205
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:12,684
Who the hell would do this?

29
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:14,807
But Steve and I never speak.

30
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,776
We never communicate
during an investigation...

31
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,144
Until the very end.

32
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,511
Who's he looking to kill?

33
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,480
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,782
You need to get out of here right now.

35
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,950
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,551
It was like endless darkness.

37
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:47,317
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

38
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:52,708
I interview living witnesses and uncover
history that's been buried and forgotten...

39
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,550
While Amy talks to the dead.

40
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:59,814
I'm in Neosho, Missouri. It's
about a half-hour outside of Joplin.

41
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,450
I got a call from a
local cop named Dennis.

42
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,613
Now, I know cops are trained to
deal with stressful situations,

43
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:07,737
but this guy sounded freaked out.

44
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:10,324
He says his wife and two
daughters are being attacked by

45
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:13,534
something they can't see and
they are petrified to be in house.

46
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:18,875
Hopefully, Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this.

47
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:35,708
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

48
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,275
This house is filled with
generations of photographs

49
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,940
and personal family possessions.

50
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:46,841
Once they are covered or removed, the
location will be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:05,685
There's a lot of activity around here.

52
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:12,029
There's a lot of dead people outside...

53
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:16,927
And they're talking
about the neighborhood.

54
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,047
Hmm.

55
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:27,788
Some guy is just like,
"insanity and death!"

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,148
Well, Dennis, you sounded
pretty concerned on the phone

57
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:45,084
about, you know, what's going on.

58
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:46,996
Now, who exactly lives here?

59
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:50,537
My wife and her daughters...

60
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:54,486
Who moved out two months
ago. We're separating.

61
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,611
I'm really sorry to hear that. Does it
have anything to do with the paranormal?

62
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,904
A lot of it did.

63
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,339
So, give me an idea of
what's going on here.

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,420
Shadow figures, footsteps, scratching.

65
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,476
We could talk about this all day.

66
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:10,250
- I know you're an Air Force vet.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,707
- You've been to Iraq.
- Yes.

68
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,308
- Okay, you're cop.
- Yes.

69
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:16,039
It's hard to imagine guys like
us being afraid of anything.

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,351
I'm fearful more of this house
than anything on the streets.

71
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:23,749
And I'm frightened for my family.

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,088
What do you know about the house itself?

73
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:30,484
The main foundation dates
into, like, the 1860s.

74
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:36,149
And I believe there was probably eight
to 11 owners in the past eight years.

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,618
But it's not just this house, there are
several houses in this neighborhood...

76
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:45,900
That have had numerous
owners because of problems.

77
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:49,402
All right. That's interesting. Okay. What
are you hoping we can do for you guys?

78
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:52,215
My wife and I are going
through some problems and we...

79
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:55,778
We're hoping to actually
fix that so we can stay here,

80
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,609
and live in a loving family without
being frightened for our lives.

81
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,280
Can you show me some spots in the
house where you've seen things?

82
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,861
- Yes.
- Okay.

83
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,649
So, Dennis, why'd you bring me outside?

84
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,736
I was mowing the lawn and saw a woman
out of the corner of my eyes here.

85
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,618
- Okay.
- On the porch.

86
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:20,134
- Wasn't the girls?
- It wasn't my wife or two girls, it was...

87
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,729
A full-body apparition of a girl.

88
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,592
Okay. Could you describe her?

89
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,853
A very old, dated white dress, maybe...

90
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,795
Late 1800s...

91
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,854
Tall collar.

92
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:38,755
She was only there for maybe three
seconds, and then she just erased.

93
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:43,570
Okay. So, I'm, like,
seeing an older woman.

94
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:46,351
She's in her 40s or 50s.

95
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:51,692
She likes light-colored
clothing with a lot of lace.

96
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:53,943
She kind of always, like, cries.

97
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,445
She's always, like, mopey.

98
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:58,346
You don't know if there's anything
with her that people might pick up on?

99
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:04,227
I think they might see her,
like a light-colored apparition.

100
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,607
So, have you ever seen
anything else outside?

101
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:11,423
Yes. I was inside and heard some
commotion come up the stairway.

102
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:17,324
And saw a black figure looking
directly at me through this window here.

103
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,019
Can you show me what it looked like?

104
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,249
When I was inside, the shadow
person came from this direction.

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,360
And all he did was lean way down,
and then, when we made eye contact,

106
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,957
he just leaned in
forward, like, I dare you.

107
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,777
And then just got up after a
second and just walked straight off.

108
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,772
Now, have you ever seen
this shadow figure again?

109
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,396
Two times for sure on
the base of the stairwell,

110
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:46,515
looking at me when I had
just come in from work.

111
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:51,207
Another time, once again, two,
three minutes home from work...

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:56,149
Go into the Master Bedroom
and heard a deep breath of...

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:02,050
And I leaned over, and he wasn't three
feet inside the doorway, just there.

114
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:09,976
I was scared to death of that
one, and I bolted out of the house.

115
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:14,205
There is a darkness here.

116
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,114
It walks down the street.

117
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,268
It's not a person.

118
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,529
It's like a huge curtain of darkness.

119
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:27,494
Someone knows...

120
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,764
Someone knows...

121
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,899
They panic.

122
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't think they know
it's affecting everyone.

123
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:47,040
Up here is where some of the scariest
stuff has actually happened to me.

124
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,081
Okay.

125
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:51,302
I heard a little girl's laughter.

126
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,239
And I spun around just
as quickly as I heard it.

127
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,994
And literally saw a...

128
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,623
Floating black mist
two 1/2, 3 feet maybe?

129
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,243
- Was anybody else at home?
- No.

130
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:04,972
No TV on or anything like that?

131
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,112
- There was nothing.
- All right, anything else?

132
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:09,512
We had another instance where...

133
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:13,273
I walked out of the bathroom
and came about where you were.

134
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:18,031
And I got struck from behind by this
very curtain rod right in the back.

135
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,149
You know, Dennis, working
with Amy all this time now,

136
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,995
I know that once it gets
physical, it's really not good.

137
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,234
Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,941
Has anything else like
this ever happened?

139
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:28,887
One time, when I actually got
out of the shower downstairs,

140
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,393
and I was drying my stomach area off...

141
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:34,614
I noticed claw marks on
either side of my stomach area.

142
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,323
Did you ever take photos of it?

143
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,930
I didn't, but I showed Aundrea.

144
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,039
Okay. What do you think's
going on in this house?

145
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,449
I wish I knew.

146
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,938
All I know is that I want to...

147
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:50,166
Make sure that my wife
and my girls are safe here.

148
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,158
- I'm just worried.
- I can see it.

149
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,176
I love them.

150
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:57,297
I'm worried about it.

151
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:03,156
Whatever this thing is...

152
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,967
It can open doors.

153
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,179
It can, like...

154
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,540
Do very physical things...

155
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:17,417
Grab people, move
things, and break things.

156
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:21,738
And this darkness saturates the whole...

157
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,770
House.

158
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,032
So, Aundrea, I talked to Dennis.

159
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,971
He told me about you guys splitting up.

160
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,678
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

161
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,845
Thank you.

162
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,969
He relayed to me that he thought the
stuff that was going on here in the house,

163
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,109
may have contributed to
you guys splitting up.

164
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,244
- You agree with that?
- I think it's possible.

165
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,534
I've been depressed, anxious.

166
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:08,654
Have you experienced anything paranormal
in this house, anything unusual?

167
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:13,081
Yeah. I was babysitting a friend's
baby, and something went across my feet,

168
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,296
just like somebody
brushing against your arm.

169
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,958
I thought it was one of the animals.

170
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,829
The dogs were outside, and the
cat was nowhere to be found.

171
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,364
Okay.

172
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:26,335
So, do you ever go out to investigate,
see where it may be coming from?

173
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:30,877
I check, make sure all the doors are
locked, check the house inside and out.

174
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,545
Anything else?

175
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:35,489
The worst is what I see... a shadow man.

176
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,522
I've seen him standing here at
foot of my bed, staring down at me.

177
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:43,821
I've woken up with him,
and I was petrified.

178
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,998
Did you ever think maybe
somebody was in the house?

179
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:50,807
I have investigated every time I
see it, and there's never anybody.

180
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,858
Okay. Now, is that the
only place you've seen him?

181
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,858
No. I've seen him upstairs.

182
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,871
He was standing on the
far side of the bunk bed.

183
00:10:57,872 --> 00:11:01,491
Okay. So, now you've got your
little girls you got to worry about.

184
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,686
They're sleeping with me.

185
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:06,015
They're too afraid to sleep upstairs,
and they don't want to be alone.

186
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:09,676
I want to know they're safe.

187
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,996
This lady, her thing,
like, I feel like she's...

188
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:20,377
She is afraid of what's under her bed.

189
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,796
I feel like her foot or her
ankle or something's been touched.

190
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:30,237
Whatever is was came from under the bed.

191
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:36,908
She has a lot of notions about...

192
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,754
- Haunting.
- Okay.

193
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,453
You know, so what she's doing,
like, yeah, there's [Bleep]

194
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:46,140
There is not good stuff
here. But, she's making it...

195
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:51,781
She's compounding, like,
she's making it worse, I guess.

196
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,422
Now, had you done
anything like a blessing or

197
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,345
anything to try to figure
out what's going on or?

198
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,032
A friend told me to
try using a sage stick.

199
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,100
Okay.

200
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:08,463
I, after that, had a college
team of ghost hunters come in.

201
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:12,642
I'm desperate. I'm willing to
try anything to get normalcy.

202
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:16,259
You know, you're worrying about your
daughters has got to drive you crazy.

203
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,403
It's very overwhelming.

204
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,395
I had a somewhat erratic childhood.

205
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:23,504
- Mom worked all the time.
- Right.

206
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,317
I was with grandma and grandpa.

207
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,978
Grandpa was the only father I knew.

208
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:31,919
He died when I was 7, so
it was mom, grandma, and me.

209
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,091
So, I don't want my girls
to have a mixed up life.

210
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:39,026
You said your grandfather
died when you were 7.

211
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,766
Do you remember much about him?

212
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:44,967
I remember everything about him. He...

213
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,442
- He was amazing.
- Okay.

214
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,752
Okay. Did he die young?

215
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:53,274
Yeah, he was only 58.

216
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,611
He died of... well, he died
of complications from chemo.

217
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,365
Okay.

218
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,431
I want to fix this.

219
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,483
I want to fix this for my girls.

220
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,770
Okay. I'm gonna try to help you do that.

221
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:07,771
- Thank you.
- Okay.

222
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:16,274
There's also, like, a father
figure that's with her.

223
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,164
A lot.

224
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,816
And he's...

225
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,217
He's upset.

226
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:27,249
Yeah, he says that there's,
like, sage or incense.

227
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,889
He said that there's no way anybody can
help her, really she needs to help herself.

228
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,822
I told her when she was
younger to not do this.

229
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:38,619
What did he tell her not to do?

230
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,580
Mmm, be into all this dark stuff.

231
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,381
But I'm trying to tell him the dark
just pretty much goes everywhere.

232
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:52,065
That's why she has to
deal with this [Bleep]

233
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:56,041
What is that? There's
something else here.

234
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:58,160
I don't know who it is.

235
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:01,535
I didn't get to see him,
but he makes you feel...

236
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,978
You know how people are like,
"I feel like I'm being watched".

237
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:08,107
But this is like burn holes through
your back, like feel really...

238
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,028
Sick.

239
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,536
So, Danielle, I was
talking to mom and Dennis.

240
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:22,045
They were telling me about
what's going on in the house.

241
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,398
Mom said you and your sister
are having a tough time.

242
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,863
Yeah, no matter where I am, I always
feel as though somebody's watching me.

243
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:32,123
Okay. Now, what kind of things are
you experiencing? What are you seeing?

244
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:35,279
Well, one time, I had a couple friends
over, and, all of a sudden, we see,

245
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,587
like, this lady, like the silhouette
of a lady walk by towards the kitchen.

246
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,797
Okay. Was she thin, heavy?

247
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,102
She was thin, and she
had one of those, like,

248
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:46,697
thicker dresses on, you
know, that like, go out.

249
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:48,793
- Okay. Like an old style?
- Yes, Sir.

250
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:51,759
Have you had any other
experiences besides seeing things?

251
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,211
Well, yes, Sir. The other
night, I was sleeping,

252
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,296
and I woke up to somebody
playing with my hair.

253
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:59,763
You know, I look around,
and I sit up and look,

254
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,674
and nobody was around me,
no animals or anything.

255
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,572
And that was the first time I had
felt it, and that was just uneasy.

256
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:07,950
You sure it wasn't the
cat or one of the dogs?

257
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,068
- My dogs were boarding.
- Are you afraid to be here alone?

258
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,747
- Yes, Sir.
- You are.

259
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,585
It's very nerve-racking.

260
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:17,443
Like, I'm always scared
I'm gonna see something or,

261
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,549
like, it's gonna hurt
me sometime or something.

262
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,690
It hasn't yet. It's just, what if?

263
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,296
Up here, it feels like a woman.

264
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:31,060
- This is a living person?
- Yes.

265
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,925
I just hear her crying...

266
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:36,086
Whimpers.

267
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,457
They're being watched maybe.

268
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:48,049
I don't know. What I see here is this thing
standing at the end of the bed, really big.

269
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,950
I think this is that same guy who
watches, the creeper of the house, I guess.

270
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:58,891
And I think there is
a closet connection.

271
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:03,121
Oh, no. That's not good.

272
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:07,564
This looks like a shadow man.

273
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,381
Shadow people are extremely
rare evil entities.

274
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:15,710
No one knows where they come from, but
they are capable of harming living people.

275
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:18,174
I don't know if he's
gonna try to take her,

276
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,545
but that's kind of what
it seems like to me.

277
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,873
Take her where?

278
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,018
Uh, into the closet.

279
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,429
What does that mean?

280
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,230
They typically kill
people, the shadow people.

281
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:48,753
Dennis said Aundrea's house has had
a lot of owners in the recent past.

282
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:51,194
So I conducted a search,
in the last 40 years,

283
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:53,552
there have been 15
different owners of the home.

284
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,873
That's unusual.

285
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,789
None of them wanted to even talk to me.

286
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,869
But Dennis mentioned that the
problem was neighborhood-wide.

287
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,770
So I've managed to track down one of
the former residents to see why she left.

288
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,766
So, you lived on Aundrea
and Dennis' block?

289
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,379
I did, across the street.

290
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,699
So, they're having some
paranormal problems.

291
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,178
Are you surprised by that?

292
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,507
Not really.

293
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:28,403
- Why is that?
- Um...

294
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:31,307
The house that Aundrea lives
in was on the market for quite

295
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:33,773
some time before anybody moved
in, it was vacant for a while.

296
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:37,466
So, I assumed they'd had
some kind of an issue there.

297
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:40,323
And I had some unusual
things happen at my house.

298
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,385
Like what?

299
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:45,292
There was a wall between the
dining room and the living room.

300
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:48,477
And there was a dark streak,
kind of a reddish-brown color,

301
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:53,582
that would go from the top of the ceiling
down, almost all the way to the floor.

302
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,033
And it would show up in the living
room and in the dining room side.

303
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,245
And I painted over it,
and I papered over it,

304
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,514
and it would just inevitably
come back every time.

305
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,824
The only way I could get rid of it in the
living room was to put paneling over it.

306
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,874
So, when you painted over
it, it would come through?

307
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:08,679
Yes.

308
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,561
- You wallpaper over it and...
- It came though.

309
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:17,022
- Really? Even with the wallpaper?
- Even the wallpaper.

310
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,590
When I started my walk,
I saw this darkness.

311
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,291
This darkness, it walks down the street.

312
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,585
It'll come right in the door.
It'll, like, literally open...

313
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:36,786
I see doors opening in this darkness.

314
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:44,035
And there were little
people or something in it.

315
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,882
Like little creature
things or something.

316
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:51,903
And there's panic because of this.

317
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:56,812
The darkness consuming this house
is carrying an evil presence with it.

318
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,014
And it's beginning to
reveal itself to me.

319
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,756
Do you know if these different
figures you saw in darkness,

320
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:05,202
if these are separate entities?

321
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:06,797
Yes.

322
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,739
They're all, like...

323
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,380
Separate beings.

324
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:18,742
I need to find everything I
can about my client's property.

325
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,470
So I head to the local library.

326
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,136
Digging through the archives...

327
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:28,135
I discover a Brothel ran on
Aundrea's land in the late 1800s.

328
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:32,404
But what really catches my attention is
a fatal shooting that took place there.

329
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:38,045
Resulting in one man's death
and an historic court case.

330
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,791
I'm on my way to meet
with a local author.

331
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:47,692
He says the case ended up with one dead
body, several trials, and no convictions.

332
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,203
Doing the research on the
property I'm investigating,

333
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:58,142
I came across an article that
there had been a murder in 1875.

334
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,369
In a Brothel that was on the property.

335
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,878
Yes, one of the rooms was
leased to Lizzie Sanford,

336
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:07,511
and she opened a
Brothel there in Neosho.

337
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:11,952
And on the night of December 23, 1875...

338
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,938
She was entertaining a 17-year-old
young man named Lane Britton.

339
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:18,228
I have a picture here of him.

340
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:21,560
She was entertaining him,
Lizzie was, and another young man

341
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:25,835
named Wiley Huffaker demanded entrance
and started pounding on the door.

342
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:29,599
And Lane Britton threatened to
shoot him if he didn't leave.

343
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,419
And Wiley said, well,
shoot or be damned!

344
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,175
And Lane took him up on it
and shot through the door and

345
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:39,264
hit him in the head and
apparently killed him instantly.

346
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:44,299
Lane Britton was arrested, and
he was tried two or three times.

347
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,456
Finally, on the third time... I think
it was at least the third time...

348
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:50,145
He was found not guilty
by reason of self-defense.

349
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:53,680
Because they said that, you
know, their lives were in danger.

350
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:59,213
So, they acquit him on a justifiable
homicide, shooting a guy through a door?

351
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,979
That's apparently the case.

352
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,163
That's not self-defense.

353
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:06,575
Not exactly, but that's kind
of what they concluded, though.

354
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,377
Okay. So, he gets away with murder.

355
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,958
Basically, yes.

356
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:21,457
At one point, I did hear a gunshot.

357
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:27,358
I heard somebody saying, ha-ha-ha-ha,
that little [Bleep] had it coming to him.

358
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,510
This area...

359
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:38,074
It has this sadness, a...

360
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:41,005
Desperate sadness.

361
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:44,007
And people lose things here.

362
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:48,088
Like, they lose, like, animals or...

363
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,146
People or children.

364
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,283
They, like, die.

365
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:09,309
Other than the Brothel shooting,

366
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,279
I haven't found any deaths directly
tied to my client's property...

367
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,847
So I go to the hall of
records to dig up old deeds,

368
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:19,549
and I come across the
name Emma Mae Liebhart.

369
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,230
Who passed away in
the house back in 1938.

370
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:27,257
I'm not sure this will help much,

371
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:33,158
but according to her death certificate,
she died of lung cancer at the age of 65.

372
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,928
I'm seeing the crying woman again.

373
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,245
And she has a horse and a buggy...

374
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:45,435
That brought her here
when she was young...

375
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,076
Like 15 or 16.

376
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,121
Do you know how she died?

377
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:57,042
I think it was some kind
of respiratory thing.

378
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:06,234
Hmm.

379
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:10,199
I think this is the
woman from outside...

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,352
And she spent a lot of time in here.

381
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,513
And she doesn't want to be

382
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:21,354
bothered by these things anymore.

383
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:23,397
What things?

384
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,918
This darkness.

385
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:33,278
I mean, she calls them little monsters.

386
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:41,372
I think she kind of feels like
they did contribute to her death.

387
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:45,556
They, like, attack her.

388
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:52,261
While at the hall of records, I
also found out that the original

389
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:57,371
owner of my client's property was
the County Sheriff back in the 1860s.

390
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,886
So, I've reached out to the current
Sheriff, and he says Louis Hutchinson,

391
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,314
was once a powerful and wealthy man.

392
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:09,215
I'm not sure if it's gonna lead
anywhere, but I need to check it out.

393
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:21,186
We had a Louis B. Hutchinson that was
Sheriff here in Newton County in 1865.

394
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:22,959
How long was he the Sheriff?

395
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,740
He was here from 1865 to 1870.

396
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:29,220
And what's he wind up doing after that?

397
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:32,626
History shows that after he
was Sheriff for five years,

398
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:36,834
he then dabbled in real estate and
became quite wealthy in the County.

399
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:40,638
Then, apparently, some of
the investments went bad.

400
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,606
Okay. So, what did he wind up doing?

401
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,042
Then he became just a
farmhand for his brother.

402
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:46,935
Well, that's kind of sad you know,

403
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,983
went from having all that
money to being a farmhand.

404
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,958
- Yes.
- So, did he remain working on the farm?

405
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:56,383
No, while he was working as a farmhand, he
had again ran for Sheriff of Newton County.

406
00:24:56,384 --> 00:25:00,222
And was, in fact, re-elected
again and won by 20 votes.

407
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:03,361
Okay, so, looks like he
got his life back together.

408
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,979
Maybe one other thing I could help
you with the records show that...

409
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,413
He wasn't able to finish his
first term after being re-elected.

410
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:14,207
- And why's that?
- That he died from paresis.

411
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,920
What is that exactly? Do you know?

412
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:18,206
It's brought on by syphilis.

413
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:20,846
It's a very, very painful death.

414
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:24,015
I know there was a Brothel on
the property I'm investigating.

415
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:28,521
So, I'm wondering if maybe he
might have got that from there.

416
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:30,968
And died. Yeah, it's
a sad ending for him.

417
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:32,889
Okay.

418
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:42,802
During my walk, I saw a sad woman
haunted by the darkness in this house.

419
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:45,135
I'm having a sketch artist draw her.

420
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,304
She was very gaunt, very thin.

421
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:51,770
Brown hair that she had up.

422
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:55,027
And then she had, like,
very distinct lines...

423
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:59,228
Running from her mouth down her chin.

424
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:05,507
Next, I described a terrifying
scene involving a shadow man.

425
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:10,955
Crawling towards the
bed from the closet.

426
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:16,501
You could see, like,
muscular definition.

427
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:19,902
And there's a kid sleeping in the bed.

428
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,363
He's creepy.

429
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,632
Amy, is this what you saw?

430
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,605
Yes.

431
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:56,478
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

432
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:01,380
it's time to reveal our findings to our
clients and each other for the first time.

433
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,604
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Dennis and Aundrea.

434
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:08,107
When the two of them called us
in, they were living together.

435
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:12,152
Unfortunately, the activity got
so bad here and so physical...

436
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:14,346
That it basically drove them apart.

437
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:16,988
So, Dennis no longer lives here.

438
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:19,695
But he doesn't think it's safe for
Aundrea and the kids to be here,

439
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:22,821
and he called for our help.

440
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:25,539
So, now that Amy's got an idea
of what's going on with you guys,

441
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,277
she's gonna tell us a
little bit about her walk.

442
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:35,234
When I first pulled up to
the house, I was like, whoa!

443
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:38,133
It's not just this house.

444
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,836
There's activity everywhere
in this neighborhood.

445
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:46,737
Like, I heard someone say it
was all insanity and death here.

446
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:51,210
The house next door, the
older lady that was there...

447
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,733
Had complained of having
spirits in the house.

448
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:56,075
Really?

449
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:59,516
I actually spoke to one of their
former neighbors, a woman named Penny.

450
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:02,814
And it was her opinion that a lot
of the houses here had activity

451
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,999
but people were afraid
to kind of talk about it.

452
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,158
The other thing was,
if you go up the block,

453
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,986
you've got two houses
for rent, two for sale.

454
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,823
The house directly across
the street is empty.

455
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:17,756
And this house in particular,
I went back 40 years...

456
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:20,695
And including yourself,
there's been 15 owners here.

457
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:22,430
Wow! Really?

458
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:25,266
That's unusual, especially
in a neighborhood.

459
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:27,187
Yeah.

460
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:33,387
I was outside, and I saw two men...

461
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:36,178
And I heard a gunshot.

462
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:42,079
Then, one of them said, ha-ha, you
know, the little [Bleep] deserved it.

463
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:45,146
Okay. How many gunshots did you hear?

464
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,880
I only heard one gunshot.

465
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,169
Okay.

466
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,779
That's interesting, because at one
time, your property had a Brothel on it.

467
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,979
Really?

468
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,390
It was run by a woman
named Lizzie Sanford.

469
00:28:55,391 --> 00:29:00,890
And one night, she was entertaining a
young guy by the name of Lane Britton.

470
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:03,241
The guy on the left.

471
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,197
Another guy by the name of Wiley
Huffaker came up to the door

472
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:08,497
and was drunk, demanded to get in.

473
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,757
This kid turns around and says, hey,
listen, knock that off, or I'm...

474
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:14,431
I'm gonna shoot you. Take it easy.

475
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:18,819
This guy Wiley Huffaker goes, shoot or
be damned, was the statement that he said.

476
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,910
Oh, wow.

477
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:23,213
And this kid puts one
round through the door.

478
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:25,343
And catches him in the head
and kills him instantly.

479
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:27,804
Oh, my gosh.

480
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,750
So, what else?

481
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:36,325
I got into the house, and
this thick veil of darkness...

482
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:39,326
Came into the house.

483
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:45,609
And then, these little three-or four-foot,
like, humanoid things that are pitch-black.

484
00:29:46,006 --> 00:29:49,306
Were within the darkness.

485
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:54,634
It definitely causes
feelings of despair.

486
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:57,532
Now, you had mentioned that
you might be a little depressed.

487
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,633
Mm-hmm.

488
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:03,325
What about their relationship? Could
it affect what was happening with them?

489
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,186
Yes.

490
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:09,673
With that comes a lot of
loss here in this area.

491
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:15,574
Like, people are losing, like,
family and friends a lot here.

492
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,965
And these humanoid things...

493
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:24,066
They can interact with
the living very physically.

494
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,394
I mean, I don't even know
where to start, actually.

495
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:29,509
You know what? Maybe we'll start
with you getting attacked upstairs.

496
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,970
I was upstairs and got
struck by a large curtain rod.

497
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,435
Whoa.

498
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,438
And it seems to be Dennis
getting the brunt of it.

499
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,705
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

500
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:45,441
I've been scratched taking a shower.

501
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,844
I'd step, go to dry off,
and it feels like burns.

502
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:54,745
And I look down, and I had scratches
on either side of my rib cage.

503
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:58,702
Amy, the thing you should know about
Dennis is that he's an Air Force veteran.

504
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:03,413
He did three tours in Iraq, he's a cop,
and he's really not afraid of anything.

505
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:06,053
But I'm scared to be here.

506
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:07,570
Okay.

507
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,491
Okay.

508
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,098
What else did you see?

509
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:16,719
I spoke with a female
that I met outside.

510
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:21,780
She moved here when she
was younger, maybe 15 or 16.

511
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:24,702
And this was about the 1890s.

512
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:30,603
When she lived here, one of the
problems that she had was breathing.

513
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:33,847
And she felt that the darkness,

514
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:37,012
and the things that are
inside of the darkness.

515
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:40,313
Contributed to her death.

516
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:43,676
She's always moaning and crying.

517
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:49,137
And she was very formally
dressed, with a high collar.

518
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:57,813
I was mowing the lawn, and I saw
a female very formally dressed.

519
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:03,161
High collar, very stylish
brown-chocolate hair pulled back...

520
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,060
Just looking at me.

521
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:07,452
And then she just... woo...

522
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,340
Just disappeared.

523
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,261
Okay.

524
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,610
I didn't even think it
was gonna come into play.

525
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:17,454
But, during my research, I came across
a woman that lived and died here.

526
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:19,520
Her name was Emma Mae Liebhart.

527
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:24,771
She came here in 1895 at the
age 22, you know, a young girl.

528
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:27,093
She moved into this home in 1908.

529
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:29,387
Now, you mentioned
respiratory problems, right?

530
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,275
Yes.

531
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:33,620
She died at the age of 65 in 1938...

532
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:36,261
Of lung cancer.

533
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:42,394
There's not photo of her,
but I got her obit here.

534
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,653
Oh, wow.

535
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,269
- You drew her, didn't you?
- I did.

536
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,660
Wow.

537
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:08,735
The eyes and the hair...

538
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,590
And the dress are good.

539
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:17,369
She was right there on the porch.

540
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,079
If it was just her, I don't
think I'd be concerned.

541
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,320
But it's not just her.

542
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:30,293
I went in the Master Bedroom.

543
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:33,774
And I met a... uh, male...

544
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:38,520
Who's upset with the woman of the house.

545
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:41,890
When she was alive, he knew her then.

546
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:44,245
He said that there's no
way anybody can help her.

547
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:46,361
She needs to help herself.

548
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:50,063
I told her when she was
younger to not do this.

549
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:51,565
What did he tell her not to do?

550
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:54,741
Be into all this dark stuff.

551
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:59,059
He seems to be some
type of father figure...

552
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,611
And he feels that his
baby's gone downhill.

553
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:07,133
But, on the other hand,
he does love this person.

554
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,835
That would make me think it was grandpa.

555
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:12,756
I was grandpa's little shadow,

556
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:15,647
and I thought he was the most
amazing thing in the world.

557
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,726
He died when I was 7.

558
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:20,261
He had had prostate cancer.

559
00:34:20,262 --> 00:34:23,802
His death affected me badly.

560
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,294
Sorry.

561
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:29,890
Now, you gave me a photo of
him. Is it okay to show her?

562
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:31,811
Yeah.

563
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:39,134
Now, you mentioned he was upset about
some kind of practicing dark stuff or...?

564
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,055
Yeah.

565
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:44,657
I had a ghost hunting team that came in.

566
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:47,205
Is that the type of thing that
would upset the guy you ran into?

567
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,066
Yes.

568
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:52,904
I don't know for sure if that
man I saw is her grandfather.

569
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:56,518
But I do know that relatives often
come back to protect the ones they love,

570
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:59,166
if they sense they're in danger.

571
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,135
Nothing seems to go right.

572
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:05,673
One relationship and then another
relationship, and he's left.

573
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:07,796
So, he could be disappointed in that.

574
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,443
Okay.

575
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:14,664
Well, this individual is
here because he's worried.

576
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,026
- Okay.
- He is...

577
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,307
Protection.

578
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:21,789
From what?

579
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,767
Well, in the bedroom downstairs...

580
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:29,448
I felt someone, like,
intensely watching me.

581
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:35,183
I glanced back, and I
saw this shadow person.

582
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:40,913
It is extremely dangerous.

583
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,233
Then, I went into the pink room.

584
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:46,879
- That's Danielle's room.
- Yeah.

585
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,280
And I saw the shadow man
crawling out of the closet.

586
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,389
Going towards me and towards the bed.

587
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,790
My goodness.

588
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:03,694
I've seen him at the
foot of my bed downstairs.

589
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,547
I've heard him breathe
all over the house.

590
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:09,496
I see him all over the place.

591
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:14,297
One time in the bathroom,
I hear this big...

592
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,996
And I kind of peered over
to the bathroom door...

593
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:24,377
And he's just right there, solid black.

594
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:28,051
And I ran out.

595
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:34,090
Well, I did do a sketch of what I saw
as far as him coming out of the closet.

596
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:45,893
- That's your daughter's room.
- Yeah.

597
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:51,094
That picture kills me.

598
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,300
I did do a sketch of what I saw as
far as him coming out of the closet.

599
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,767
- That's your daughter's room.
- Yeah.

600
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:33,344
That picture kills me.

601
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:36,027
It's hard for me to hand
that over to you guys.

602
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:39,268
No wonder she's afraid.

603
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,619
That's disturbing.

604
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:49,384
I definitely don't want my wife
or my two daughters just being...

605
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:53,345
Crawled upon and climbed into bed.

606
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:58,078
It bothers me a great deal.
I love this family, and I...

607
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,963
I don't want anything to harm them.

608
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:05,766
So, the question is, what
the hell is going on here?

609
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:10,027
There must be some specific location...

610
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,730
In this neighborhood.

611
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,025
Some type of doorway.

612
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:18,653
Where the shadow people and little
humanoid creatures I saw are coming from.

613
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:22,494
These little humanoid creatures...

614
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,024
Or shadow people.

615
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:30,501
There seems to be kind of,
like, a whole Army of them.

616
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:36,202
But I believe that he's some
type of ringleader of them.

617
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:40,556
So, this thing upstairs in Danielle's
room, is that a shadow person?

618
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:43,110
I believe it is. Yes.

619
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,349
And that's very bad.

620
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,490
Shadow people are extremely dangerous.

621
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:52,843
What exactly are shadow people?

622
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:55,321
There's a lot of different theories.

623
00:38:55,322 --> 00:39:00,962
Some people think that they're
some type of alien being.

624
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:07,743
People are still convinced that
they're some type of demonic entity.

625
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,340
They tend to go after elderly
individuals or children.

626
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:19,613
Or homes that are suffering
some type of severe dysfunction.

627
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:24,318
- And these things can kill?
- Yes.

628
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,287
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:29,023
I mean, is this thing going
after Danielle, or it just his...

630
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,285
It seems to be everybody in the house.

631
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,829
I got to keep my girls safe.

632
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,999
They're everything to me.

633
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,075
Yeah. I'm frightened to death.

634
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:46,836
We're gonna do whatever we
have to do to keep them safe.

635
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:52,348
So, it's obviously been a tough night.

636
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,289
And even though you guys always
thought your house was haunted...

637
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,814
You really didn't think it was
this severe or this dangerous.

638
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,252
You got a grave situation here.

639
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:06,055
But the big question is, is it safe
for you to stay here with the girls,

640
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,363
and maybe get your family back together?

641
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:14,264
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has an answer for you.

642
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:20,810
This is the last thing that
I wanted it to be, you know?

643
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:24,152
I don't want that for...

644
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:27,453
Many, many, many reasons.

645
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:32,467
- You can't fight this, can you?
- No.

646
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,764
That's what we needed to know, though.

647
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,033
Yeah. Who's gonna buy the place now?

648
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,094
Another fool like me?

649
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,961
I'm really sorry.

650
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:47,734
There's a lot of people who think
that shadow people can be dealt with.

651
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:50,136
I personally...

652
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:52,177
Don't.

653
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:58,073
If we move out of here...

654
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:00,628
- Can this follow us?
- No.

655
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:05,130
The protector might be the only reason the
girls and I haven't been hurt like he has.

656
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,168
It hasn't been easy.

657
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:09,265
I know.

658
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,724
Maybe this is something that can bring
youse closer together, fighting...

659
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:16,446
- For a family.
- For a family.

660
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:18,685
We'll be all right.

661
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,036
It'll be okay.

662
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:25,968
Now, if they can afford it, would it
be better if they slept someplace else?

663
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,509
That would be a great idea.

664
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:33,589
I wouldn't wish this upon anybody.

665
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,293
Maybe start fresh and
get out of here and...

666
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,716
We're gonna get out. We're
gonna get the family out.

667
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:42,735
- Okay.
- I'm leaving.

668
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:46,036
I've got to protect us.

669
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:48,869
I really wish I had another solution,

670
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,415
but I've never heard of shadow
people being removed from anywhere.

671
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:55,878
And I should know, because they
tormented me in my childhood home,

672
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,007
and I could do nothing about it.

673
00:41:58,008 --> 00:41:59,717
But if I ever figure it out,

674
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:05,598
I'll be back to help Dennis
and Aundrea cleanse their home.
