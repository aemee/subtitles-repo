1
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:15,160
She can go into people's bodies.

2
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:17,235
Said the ghost
has scratched him.

3
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:20,342
I yelled at whatever was here,
"Leave!"

4
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:22,743
Something is so physically wrong
with her.

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,181
The body was chopped up
and thrown into the harbor.

6
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:30,052
This is un-[bleep]- bearable.

7
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:32,787
So much pain!

8
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,729
It's really bad in here.

9
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,768
My name is Amy Allan.

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,972
Something is not right.

11
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,109
I see dead people.

12
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,280
This person might have been
a serial killer.

13
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:46,181
I speak to dead people.

14
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,718
You get those chills.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,289
And they speak to me.

16
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,830
He is darkness.
He is evil.

17
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,839
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

18
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,508
I think she broke her neck.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,876
I rely on my partner.

20
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:59,578
I'm Steve di Shiavi.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,681
I'm a retired New York City
Homicide detective.

22
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,218
You telling me the truth?

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,791
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

24
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,427
I think the devil is down here.

25
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:09,929
It's my job to reveal them.

26
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,097
Who the hell would do this?

27
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,535
But Steve and I never speak...

28
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,504
we never communicate
during an investigation.

29
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,871
...until the very end.

30
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,242
Who's he looking to kill?

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,214
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

32
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,516
You need to get out of here
right now.

33
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:23,618
Or time to get out.

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,425
It was like endless darkness.

35
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:43,787
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

36
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,660
I hear what living witnesses
have to say

37
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:51,032
and uncover any secrets
buried in the property's past

38
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:53,773
while Amy talks with the dead.

39
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm in historic
Winthrop, Massachusetts.

40
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:59,351
It's about 15 minutes
outside of Boston.

41
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,989
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Cynthia.

42
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,056
Now, she was hysterical
on the phone.

43
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,393
She says
that whatever's in the house

44
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,731
is attacking her 14-year-old
son, who has special needs.

45
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,534
She says if we can't help,

46
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:14,336
she's afraid
what's going to happen next.

47
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,011
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,982
I look for anything that could
reveal information to her,

49
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,486
like family photographs.

50
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,988
Once I conceal them all,

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,692
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:47,309
I don't feel good.

53
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,548
There's some woman there.

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,051
She's making me so sick.

55
00:02:57,788 --> 00:03:00,889
The dead know I'm coming
long before I do.

56
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,459
And one dead woman
from this location

57
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,927
is desperate
to have her story told.

58
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,930
Oh, man.
That is some pain, man.

59
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:12,900
She's jumped me,
entered my body.

60
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,201
And I'm experiencing her pain,

61
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:19,039
which is so intense
that I'm scared for my safety.

62
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,276
This is not good.

63
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:31,887
This woman that showed up,
she is very sick.

64
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,060
She's obviously inconsolable

65
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:39,694
and in so much pain.

66
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,400
This is un-[bleep]- bearable.

67
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,946
Cynthia, you sounded
really concerned on the phone.

68
00:03:56,948 --> 00:04:02,314
We've had a lot of noises,
tapping, banging.

69
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:05,451
I've seen things, shadows.

70
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,820
But, really,
the reason why I've called

71
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:10,423
is my youngest son, Nathaniel.

72
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,262
He's 14
and is in the autism spectrum.

73
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:15,995
And I really feel
this is affecting him.

74
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:18,097
Okay. In what way?

75
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,333
Well, he's actually
been scratched a few times.

76
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:22,467
He's frightened.

77
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,938
And he's not quite the same
anymore,

78
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,539
since we've moved in here.

79
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,906
He was a fun kid,
really outgoing.

80
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,974
Okay.

81
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,644
I called him the mayor.

82
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,345
He would be all bubbly
and talk to anyone.

83
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:37,245
And he's just different.

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,680
There's no joy anymore.

85
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:42,948
I'm so mad to see him afraid.

86
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,082
And I yelled at whatever
was here to leave him alone.

87
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,815
"My home, my child.

88
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,449
Leave."

89
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,850
It didn't cut it.

90
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:54,184
I don't know what to do for him
anymore. I really don't.

91
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:01,055
This girl that jumped me,

92
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:05,456
she can go into people's bodies
very easily.

93
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,961
So, I had to, like,
disconnect a little bit

94
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:13,100
because she was
making me so sick.

95
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:27,712
She inadvertently jumps people.

96
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,914
And she is seeking help.

97
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,016
Unfortunately, her presence

98
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:39,160
can make people feel
very, very depressed...

99
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:42,259
And suicidal.

100
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,429
So, now, who lives in the house
with you?

101
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,333
Well, my husband lives here
with myself and Nathaniel.

102
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,265
And I have two older sons
that live here, as well.

103
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,597
Okay.

104
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,598
And this was my parents' house,
and I grew up here.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,834
Oh, okay.

106
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,970
And I wanted to
come back to my home.

107
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:03,039
Well, did you have any
experiences when you were...

108
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,174
Yes.

109
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,110
As soon as my parents
bought this house,

110
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,312
we all had experiences.

111
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:10,182
Did you have any hesitation
about buying it, then?

112
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,651
Yeah.

113
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,486
I had a catholic priest
come in,

114
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,689
bless the house,
and pray for Nathaniel.

115
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:18,794
And I was confident that
that would be sufficient.

116
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,432
Now I do feel guilty.

117
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,467
Okay.

118
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,300
Your parents
have both passed away?

119
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,834
Yeah. This is my dad.

120
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:29,205
He passed away here at home
in '95.

121
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,941
He had pancreatic cancer.

122
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:33,342
Ah, geez.

123
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,544
So, now, he passes.
What about mom?

124
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:39,348
She passed in the nursing home.

125
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,684
When I bought the house,
she was very upset.

126
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,656
Okay.
Was there a reason for that?

127
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,224
I have no idea.

128
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:48,426
After it closed,
she left me a message

129
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,797
that she didn't want me
to have the house.

130
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,665
Yeah, but it's to her daughter.

131
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,030
She made it quite clear.

132
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,030
Okay. Did you get along
with your mom?

133
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,301
Um...

134
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,783
she was a very
irritable-type person.

135
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:04,322
She had a really bad temper.

136
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,026
Okay.

137
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:09,027
Did you ever
resolve your mother

138
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,797
being upset with you
buying the house?

139
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,833
No, not at all.

140
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,743
There is an old lady.

141
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,615
She watches.
She's always like this...

142
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:33,589
Her thing is that if
she showed herself for real,

143
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,261
nobody would be afraid of her.

144
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:38,396
Because who's going to be afraid
of a little old lady?

145
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:41,097
So, she makes herself tall.

146
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,766
Like, if she stands straight up,

147
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,168
she can put her head
through the ceiling.

148
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,372
She has, like, a long,
spindly, like, neck

149
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,639
and, like, skeleton legs.

150
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:57,912
It's a very strange composition
of pieces.

151
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,820
She's angry, bitter,
resentful, hateful.

152
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:12,192
And when this lady was alive,
she was very distant and cold.

153
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:15,829
She hates humanity in general.

154
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:18,964
And, you know,
she had to, like, hide that.

155
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,035
Do you know when she's from?

156
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:28,144
She says that she was alive
in the '50s.

157
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,110
Okay.

158
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:33,651
And she was a housewife.

159
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,160
Why'd you bring me
in this room?

160
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:45,342
Well, Nathaniel won't go in
his room -- frightened to death.

161
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,868
So, we had to trade bedrooms.

162
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,568
My husband and I
are now sleeping in his room.

163
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,676
That was my bedroom as a child.

164
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,710
The bedroom set
that's in there now,

165
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:00,046
that actually was
my parents' bedroom set.

166
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,051
Oh, really?
When they passed, I kept it.

167
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,786
Okay.
That's interesting.

168
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,154
Now, are things
any better for you

169
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:07,060
that you're in the other room?

170
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,360
No, actually.

171
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,028
I've been having
terrible nightmares, you know,

172
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,931
where someone gets injured
in a boating accident

173
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,033
or crossing the road
and getting hit.

174
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,013
It's just...
they're violent accidents.

175
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,631
And I'm not one
to dream like that.

176
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,699
Are you taking any medication
that may cause weird dreams?

177
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,001
No, nothing at all.

178
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,604
How are you living like this?

179
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,006
It's terrible.

180
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,675
Here I am, an adult, and I sleep
with a night-light in there.

181
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:44,153
I do feel like
a child is being chased...

182
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,587
and a woman.

183
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,727
Like, emotionally,
they're getting chased here.

184
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,798
What do you mean?

185
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,367
I don't know how to explain it.

186
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:58,503
Are they being chased
in their nightmares, maybe?

187
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,985
Oh, she likes this room.

188
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,622
Mm.

189
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,893
She does things in the bed.

190
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:24,900
She likes to stand right here,
slide down real slow,

191
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:29,137
and then, like, be on the floor,
all the way on the floor.

192
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,874
And then, she'll like --
you know, she'll strangle.

193
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:35,110
But when she touches her,
she takes her life.

194
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:39,151
What do you mean?

195
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,819
She is going to kill her.

196
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:10,362
So, Nicholas, I understand
that this was Nathaniel's room,

197
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:12,197
but you're sleeping in here?
Yes.

198
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,463
So, let me ask you,

199
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,098
what was the breaking point
for him to move out of here?

200
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
Well, one night,
in the middle of the night,

201
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,469
he came running into our room

202
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,771
and said,
"There's a guy in my room" --

203
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,904
a shadow man, shadow figure,
however he said it.

204
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:25,206
And he wouldn't
come back in his room.

205
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,475
He said,
"I'm not going back in there.

206
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,843
I'm not sleeping in there
again."

207
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,614
Got to figure out
what's going on here.

208
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:31,985
This is too much.

209
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,490
Your wife said he was getting
physically attacked.

210
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,124
Well, actually, one day,
he woke up.

211
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,360
And then he came and says,
"Mommy, look at my arm."

212
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:41,798
And we took a picture,
and that's what we saw.

213
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,102
And I said,
"What happened?"

214
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,471
He says, "A ghost did it."

215
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,907
He said the ghost
had scratched him.

216
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,910
Did you guys question him
about that?

217
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,916
Yeah. I mean,
my first thing is, like,

218
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,988
"Maybe you scratched yourself
when you're sleeping."

219
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,790
He said no, he wasn't.
He was pretty adamant.

220
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,490
He says,
"I wasn't sleeping."

221
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,927
There's no way he would ever
make up anything

222
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,666
or do that
and then tell us something else.

223
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:11,744
The old lady,
she likes it in this area.

224
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,882
She wants to freak people out

225
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,519
and make them leave
and not come in here.

226
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:30,062
She is very, very proud
of inflicting pain.

227
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,831
What kind of pain?

228
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,101
People get scratched here.

229
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,134
What about yourself?
Are you having any experiences?

230
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:41,771
Well, the first night I
came in here, I had a nightmare.

231
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:45,307
I thought it was real, the most
vivid dream I probably ever had.

232
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,674
I was looking up at a plane.

233
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:48,109
The plane started coming down

234
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:51,642
and, you know, exploded,
right into the ground.

235
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,313
Dreams, like, with screaming
people in it and violence.

236
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:58,183
It's kind of interesting
how you and your wife

237
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:01,086
are having
the same type of dreams.

238
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,257
Is it just dreams you're experiencing?
No.

239
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,830
One night, I woke up wide awake
about 3:00 in the morning.

240
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:09,328
I looked up,
and I saw a shadow.

241
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,165
And it was going back and forth
across the top of the door.

242
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,269
Like, you could see it
blocking the light.

243
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,704
It was about a minute,
at least a minute.

244
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:20,205
And then I got up,
and I started to come over here.

245
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,740
And there was nothing here.

246
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,947
This stuff is confusing to me.

247
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,515
We've prayed.

248
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,652
And the priest
across the street,

249
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:31,155
he came in and blessed the house
and prayed for Nathaniel.

250
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:36,395
What I've done, you know,
isn't the answer.

251
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:39,363
So, to me, this would be
like a last resort, even,

252
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,698
you know, you guys here.

253
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,569
I believe, like, pretty basic,
like, black and white,

254
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:47,538
like angels and demons,
you know, good and bad.

255
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,373
Right.
What do you think this is?

256
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,542
There's something wrong.

257
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:56,517
There's something else
that's going on here

258
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,957
with these doors, this hallway.

259
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:04,228
I'm thinking right now
it's the old lady.

260
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,866
Why is she so weird
about how she moves?

261
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,867
Mm. She says...
Oh, no, yeah.

262
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,800
That adds to, like,
the creepy, creepy factor.

263
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:17,337
She's a sociopath.

264
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:22,036
She's chasing them,
these two people.

265
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:24,672
One is the living woman.

266
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:28,908
And the other one,
I think it's a boy.

267
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,848
I was talking to mom and dad,

268
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,050
and mom was telling me

269
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:40,350
that you're having a tough time
in the house.

270
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,584
Oh, yeah.

271
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:45,889
When I go upstairs, it takes me
a while to fall asleep

272
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,125
because I feel like I'm being
watched for some reason.

273
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:52,058
And a couple times,
I saw this weird black thing.

274
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,529
It was just, like, an outline.

275
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,366
And what did it do?

276
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:58,366
It just stands there
for like five seconds.

277
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,700
And what happened?

278
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:01,000
It just completely disappeared.

279
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,269
I got so scared,

280
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,638
I actually switched rooms
with my parents.

281
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
Okay.

282
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,541
Dad showed me a picture
of a scratch on your arm.

283
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:10,577
Yes.

284
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:11,879
What happened?

285
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,114
I felt, like, a weird burning.

286
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:15,550
And I looked,
and it was a weird scratch.

287
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,452
Did the cat do it or anything?

288
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:20,922
No, definitely not
because it was perfectly fine.

289
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,689
And then,
like five minutes later,

290
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,223
there was a weird scratch.

291
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,092
Would you be afraid
to be alone in the house?

292
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,228
Yes, actually.

293
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,098
Okay.
What about your old bedroom?

294
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,834
That's the worst.

295
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,972
Old lady does weird [bleep]
up here.

296
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:41,010
What does she do?

297
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,779
She does weird stuff
on the floor up in here.

298
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:49,685
And then,
there's someone crying about it,

299
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,388
being afraid about it.

300
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,729
I think it takes her a lot
to murder someone.

301
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,731
So, she's focused on

302
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,399
offing a living woman
that lives here now.

303
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:10,071
She's just kind of trying to
get that done and over with.

304
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,307
And then, she'll move on
to the next person.

305
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,910
She's definitely, like,
screwing with the kid now.

306
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:33,117
You know you're in the northeast

307
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,789
when you trace the history
on a property

308
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,293
and it takes you back
to the 1600s.

309
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,766
Turns out, the first settlers
on my client's property

310
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,968
lived there
for a couple hundred years.

311
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,640
I asked a local genealogist
to look into it for me,

312
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:45,875
and he said he found something
that will help my case.

313
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,818
You know, Steve,
this is one of the oldest deeds

314
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,152
I've ever searched through.

315
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,717
It goes back to the 1600s.

316
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,587
And I came across
the Bill and Belcher families.

317
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,586
Mm-hmm.

318
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:05,820
What can you tell me
about them?

319
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,822
In November of 1635,

320
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,824
John Bill and his wife

321
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,824
came from England
with their family.

322
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:16,624
And by 1690, the family
owns most of Pullen Poynt,

323
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,426
today's Winthrop.
Okay.

324
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,965
So, how does the Belcher family
get involved?

325
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:26,004
Well, in 1697, Hannah Bill
marries Joseph Belcher.

326
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:28,307
Okay. So, these were two
pretty prominent families, then.

327
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,076
Exactly.

328
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,843
Now, you said there was
some information on the phone

329
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,578
that would help my case.
What were you talking about?

330
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,183
Well, I went through
over 200 years of records.

331
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:39,052
And, of course, there's deaths,
standard things...

332
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,555
That is
until the mid-to late-1800s.

333
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,525
Okay.
During that period,

334
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:47,962
a dozen Belcher children
under the age of four die.

335
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:50,166
Okay.
Do you know what they died from?

336
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:53,471
You might want to take a look
at some of these death records.

337
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,575
Most of it was common ailments
of the time --

338
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,144
cholera, consumption,

339
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,745
what we know today
as tuberculosis.

340
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,879
So, we're talking about
some kind of an epidemic?

341
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,547
No.

342
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:11,923
But in the 1700s, there was
an outbreak of smallpox.

343
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,558
And that was in the area
I'm investigating?

344
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,558
Exactly.

345
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,426
Okay.

346
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:21,393
I saw the old lady.

347
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:26,191
And then I saw
these three little kids.

348
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:30,097
And she was claiming
that she killed them.

349
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:38,072
Then I heard a man say
that she didn't kill them.

350
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,414
This is not a good room.

351
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,782
Pain and then pain, pain.

352
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,183
Blood and death and pain.

353
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:51,023
Now that I know there was
a smallpox epidemic in Winthrop,

354
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,124
I need to find out more
about it.

355
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,293
I'm heading over
to meet with a local historian.

356
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:56,964
He says
there's a direct connection

357
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:59,433
between the outbreak and
the property I'm investigating.

358
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,474
So, Bob, I understand that
there was a smallpox epidemic

359
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,408
related to the property
I'm investigating.

360
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,407
Correct.

361
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:17,975
When did it happen?

362
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:20,010
December of 1751.

363
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,145
So, how does this epidemic
start?

364
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:25,086
The ship<i> The Bumper</i>
came into town

365
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,922
and ran aground
here in Winthrop.

366
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:29,356
Captain Nicholas Cousens,

367
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:32,159
actually, he had a crew member
that was sick.

368
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,066
And he quarantined him on ship
prior to this crash.

369
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,637
He ordered everybody
off the ship.

370
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,372
And then he just basically
got townspeople

371
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:42,703
to help out him
unloading his ship.

372
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,838
So, that's how
it winds up spreading?

373
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,907
Correct.

374
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:46,611
That's a scumbag move.
It is.

375
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,582
Over 7,500 people got infected.

376
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,784
569 people died.

377
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,552
Wow.

378
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:55,457
Considering the time it was
and the amount of people,

379
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,826
that's a lot of people.

380
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,696
A lot of people,
especially around this area.

381
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,030
I mean, back then,
they were mainly farmers.

382
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,565
What do you know about
the symptoms of smallpox?

383
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,304
Well, you have a high fever,
body ache,

384
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,906
have open sores,
and stuff like that.

385
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,440
And if you'll look
at this picture,

386
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,907
you can see how painful
it can be.

387
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,442
This is what a guy
would look like?

388
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,910
That's what it looks like.
Oh, geez.

389
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,911
Yeah.

390
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,577
So, Bob, you mentioned
on the phone

391
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,978
there was a direct connection

392
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,379
between the epidemic and
the property I'm investigating.

393
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,080
Right.
Because a lot of the patients

394
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:24,780
were actually taken
to John Bill's house,

395
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,182
the owner of that property.

396
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,319
That took a lot of guts
for this guy to do that.

397
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:29,820
A lot of guts, yep.

398
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:41,521
I see all of these men
running up from over here.

399
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,094
They're all dying.

400
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,998
And they're all scared.

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,302
They're all white men.

402
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:55,841
There is so much pain.

403
00:20:58,544 --> 00:21:04,585
All these dead --
these dead souls, these men.

404
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,922
There's so much sadness here.

405
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,988
I'm at the local library
to see what else I can uncover

406
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,793
about my client's property.

407
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,961
Digging through old records,

408
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:35,367
I find a young woman named
Suzanna Geary who died in 1905.

409
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:40,273
But what's really disturbing is
where her body was discovered --

410
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:43,776
washed up onshore
right by Cynthia's house.

411
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,947
I'm heading over to meet with
a local police lieutenant

412
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:49,084
who I asked
to look into it for me.

413
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:52,654
He says this story
is every parents' nightmare.

414
00:21:57,156 --> 00:22:00,853
Lieutenant, came across
this gruesome case back in 1905.

415
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,122
Body washed up on the shore

416
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,824
pretty close to the property
I'm investigating.

417
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,059
What do you know about it?

418
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,260
Suzanna Geary --

419
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,161
20-year-old dancer
originally from Massachusetts

420
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,962
working in a performance
in Boston.

421
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,401
This is a picture of her
right here

422
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:16,504
taken from a newspaper
back in 1905.

423
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:18,638
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah, pretty girl.

424
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,642
She was going out with one of the stage
managers of her production company.

425
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,977
Okay.

426
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:24,780
She became pregnant,
wasn't married...

427
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:25,947
Ah.

428
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,629
...and things started to go bad
from there.

429
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:34,657
I know that this woman
is younger,

430
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:38,559
probably in her teen or 20s.

431
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:42,264
She has long hair about here,
brown.

432
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:46,134
She'd kind of skinny
for a pregnant woman.

433
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:51,177
The young girl who jumped me
at the start of my walk

434
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,545
has left my body.

435
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:55,317
And I'm now able to see
what she looked like in life.

436
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,987
I'm surprised to find
that she's pregnant.

437
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:01,422
Very pretty, large, brown eyes.

438
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:02,790
Very dark.

439
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,323
Um...

440
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,091
and obviously very sad.

441
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:11,467
So, what happens next?

442
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,670
Suzanna and her boyfriend,
Nathan --

443
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,874
here's a sketch of him
right here...

444
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,644
...they decide
that having this baby

445
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:21,111
isn't going to be the best for
either of them in their careers.

446
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,710
And they decide
to go have an illegal abortion.

447
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,548
They find a doctor
in the Boston area.

448
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,917
Okay.
That doesn't go so well

449
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,553
because she develop
septicemia and peritonitis,

450
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,422
two highly infectious diseases.

451
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,892
They're serious today,
never mind back then.

452
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:35,629
I've heard of it.
But what are the symptoms?

453
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,731
You have any idea?
Well, I know that a sepsis infection

454
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,798
is in your bloodstream,

455
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,765
and it can travel
throughout your body.

456
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,632
Causes excruciating pain.
It's a deadly disease.

457
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,800
Okay. So, now,
she develop this infection.

458
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,601
And I assume
she goes back to the doctor?

459
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:48,803
That is correct.

460
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,005
A second procedure is performed

461
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:51,672
by this doctor, Percy McLeod.

462
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,242
But they go back
to the same office?

463
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:56,477
Yes.
But this is a new doctor that sees her?

464
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,745
We don't know exactly who
performed the first procedure.

465
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,247
It could have been
Dr. McLeod.

466
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,683
He was trying to fix whatever went
wrong with the first procedure.

467
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:05,585
And instead of fixing it,
she dies a day later.

468
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,428
She was pregnant...

469
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,797
and she lost the baby.

470
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,362
And I think she lost her man.

471
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:22,800
Something is so physically wrong
with her.

472
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:26,638
This woman's physical and
emotional trauma is so severe

473
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,576
that I'm experiencing
all of the pain she felt

474
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,340
when she was alive.

475
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:38,347
I've never felt so much pain.

476
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,414
It hurt.

477
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,884
It was so painful.

478
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:47,019
Seriously, I would've [bleep]
just shot myself in the head.

479
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:53,126
Her loss is just...

480
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,393
Oh, it's really bad.

481
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:03,362
So, how do we end up with her
going DOA in a doctor's office

482
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:04,629
to being in the water?

483
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,098
I'm sure that the doctors,

484
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,268
realizing that they had
a dead body on their hands,

485
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,901
panicked and started to
try to cover up their tracks,

486
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:13,234
try to dispose of the body

487
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,367
so that no finger-pointing
would be made

488
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:17,935
that they were doing
any kind of illegal activity.

489
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,969
These two gentlemen here --

490
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,272
hired by the doctor
to dispose of the body.

491
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:26,374
The body was chopped up,
went into suitcases,

492
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:29,075
and thrown into the harbor.

493
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,846
So, what happens next?

494
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:35,349
Two young boys in a rowboat
saw the bag floating,

495
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,016
decided to bring it in.

496
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:38,950
God knows what's inside of it.

497
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:41,419
They bring it to shore,
they open it up,

498
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:44,256
and wrapped up inside
was a torso.

499
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,557
What did they do with the torso
at this point?

500
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,091
Well, it's right next to
the cemetery.

501
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:49,459
They bring it in
to the cemetery.

502
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,463
And that's right next to
the house I'm investigating.

503
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,799
Exactly.

504
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,004
Somehow, the mother
identifies it as her daughter.

505
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,673
So now we have a victim.

506
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:59,411
We found an article,
actually, of divers

507
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:00,779
looking for other evidence.

508
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:02,883
And that's when they
discovered her head.

509
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,651
Oh, wow.
Look at this.

510
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:08,190
So, now, what winded up
happening with the doctor?

511
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,494
Did he ever get convicted
or charged?

512
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:12,827
The people that helped the
doctor, they were convicted.

513
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,528
They were sent to
the Charlestown penitentiary

514
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,597
for seven years.

515
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,766
The doctor in this case,
he was charged,

516
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,433
but he was acquitted.

517
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,442
During my walk, a traumatized
young woman jumped my body.

518
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,343
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

519
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:37,045
to describe
how she appeared in life.

520
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:39,880
She was on the thin side.

521
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:46,152
Deep-brown colored eyes,
very large.

522
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,455
Very pointy chin.

523
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:57,424
Yes, that's who I saw.

524
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:23,200
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

525
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:25,082
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

526
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,040
and our clients
for the first time.

527
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,343
Amy, I want you to meet
Nicholas and Cynthia.

528
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:31,801
This is their home.

529
00:27:31,803 --> 00:27:33,538
They've both experienced
a lot of things here.

530
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,941
But the main reason
they called us

531
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:39,310
and their main concern is their
14-year-old son, Nathaniel.

532
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,310
Okay.

533
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:42,144
He has special needs,

534
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:45,477
and it seems like
he's being singled out

535
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,012
and victimized
in a violent manner.

536
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,115
What they want to know from us

537
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:51,749
is if it's safe enough
to stay here.

538
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,151
With that, I'm going to ask her

539
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:55,318
to tell us
about how her walk went.

540
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:06,162
On my way to do the walk,
I was jumped by a female.

541
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:10,598
And I became violently ill.

542
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,233
It was extremely sudden,
totally unexpected,

543
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:16,304
and extremely overwhelming.

544
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:20,007
She felt so much loneliness.

545
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:33,254
Okay.

546
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,025
Getting jumped is
not easy for her.

547
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,528
I hate when it happens.

548
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,696
Hmm.

549
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:49,374
I can't even imagine
living with that kind of pain.

550
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,877
If I had been her,

551
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:55,160
I would have just taken a gun
and shot myself in the head.

552
00:28:57,683 --> 00:29:01,822
The thing is is that
she doesn't mean to jump people.

553
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,161
But when she does, the people
can become violently ill,

554
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:11,704
extremely depressed,
possibly suicidal.

555
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:14,306
One of the things
you told me about your son

556
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,175
was how his personality changed.

557
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:19,075
Well, really shortly
after we moved in,

558
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:20,210
he just really changed.

559
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:23,247
I used to call him
the little mayor.

560
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,546
Talked to everyone.

561
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:26,714
Now, he doesn't want to
really go out

562
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,482
and do things with other kids

563
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:31,618
or enjoy school activities
like he used to.

564
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,021
Were you able
to find anything else about her?

565
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:41,055
Well, she's probably between
16 and 22, I would say.

566
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:44,154
Very little, thin, pale.

567
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:48,190
She had very long brown hair
and huge brown eyes.

568
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:52,590
And what I figured out
was that sense of loss

569
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:56,028
was because
she had been pregnant

570
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,896
and lost her child.

571
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:04,534
A lot of it's making sense.

572
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,269
It's not a story
you're going to want to hear.

573
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:12,574
So, a young dancer
by the name of Suzanna Geary.

574
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,076
She was 20 years old.

575
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,478
She was from Boston.

576
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,615
Her boyfriend,
who was the stage manager

577
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,253
for the dancing troupe
she was in got her pregnant.

578
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,856
Uh-oh.

579
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:25,057
And they decided to
get an abortion,

580
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,523
which obviously was illegal
back then.

581
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,525
And there's a sketch
of her boyfriend.

582
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,797
This is Morris Nathan.

583
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,598
Now, while she's recovering,

584
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,869
she develop
what they call septicemia.

585
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:44,174
She got very sick,
excruciating pain, apparently.

586
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,811
So, she goes back
to Dr. Percy McLeod.

587
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:51,681
They do another procedure.

588
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,316
Didn't go too well.

589
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,618
She dies the next day.

590
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,186
Now, the police at the time
believed he panicked.

591
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:01,121
He cuts her up...

592
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,058
dismembers her body,

593
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,862
then hires two guys to take
the body and get rid of it --

594
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,730
throws it into the harbor.

595
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,730
God.

596
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:10,930
A few days later,

597
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:14,698
her body washes up
very close to the house.

598
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,940
Now, I've got a picture of her.

599
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:23,910
And she's a pretty girl, too.

600
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,511
Oh, my God.

601
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:31,214
Well, I did do a sketch of her.

602
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,951
And this is the same girl
that jumped you?

603
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:35,951
Yes.

604
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:46,399
You take a look at that.

605
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:55,209
Without question, that's her.

606
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,243
Wow.

607
00:31:57,245 --> 00:32:00,848
The eyes, the eyes.

608
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,852
Mm-hmm.

609
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:04,954
That's horrible.

610
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:09,861
I mean, I can't even
put words to that.

611
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,736
What else did you see
on your walk?

612
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,903
So, I came into the house,

613
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:24,777
and in the kitchen,
I see this elderly woman.

614
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:31,717
And she is filled with
resentment, hatred, bitterness.

615
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:36,590
She was very cold and distant
in life.

616
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:38,426
One of the things
that she expressed

617
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:41,896
was that she absolutely
disdains humanity

618
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:45,898
and that when she was alive
she had repressed that.

619
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,471
She told me that she lived here,
I think, in the '50s,

620
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:53,940
that she was a housewife.

621
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:58,348
You mentioned your mom wasn't
always that great, that nice.

622
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,554
Yeah, my mother kind of
didn't like a lot of people.

623
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:06,723
She kind of ruled the roost
a lot.

624
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:09,424
She didn't like anybody.

625
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:10,893
I'm trying to be gracious.

626
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,930
She actually said that she loved
the dog better than my children.

627
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,399
Really?

628
00:33:16,736 --> 00:33:19,671
You said you got a good look?

629
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,940
Mm-hmm.

630
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:29,413
Wow.

631
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,652
Is that who you saw?

632
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:35,055
Yeah.
That looks like her.

633
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:37,889
But definitely older.

634
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,762
She didn't want you to
have the house, either.

635
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:44,230
No, mnh-mnh.

636
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,297
When she found out the house
was sold and the papers passed,

637
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,271
she just was really upset
and left me a voicemail.

638
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:54,005
She said
I stole the effing house.

639
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:57,644
And she doesn't give an "f"
what I think.

640
00:33:57,646 --> 00:34:00,745
And "f" me,
and "f" everyone else.

641
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,945
And use your imagination.

642
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:05,748
Well, all I know is

643
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,452
that the woman I met
repressed a lot of stuff,

644
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:12,887
like did not really
give a [bleep] about anybody.

645
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,056
Mm-hmm.

646
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:15,290
Sounds right.

647
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,960
What is she doing
around the house?

648
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:19,662
Nothing good.

649
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:24,364
She wants to scare people.

650
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:28,336
She had made herself
about seven to eight feet tall.

651
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,768
Like, she was showing me

652
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,506
this monstrous, disgusting,
deformed thing.

653
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:39,674
And that helps her to frighten
and cause fear and all of that.

654
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:43,682
I know she can get physical
in the house to people.

655
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:46,152
Like,
upstairs in the master bedroom,

656
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,218
I saw her
coming through the wall.

657
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,154
And she'll, like,
slink down onto the floor

658
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,924
and then come up the bed

659
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:56,163
and, like, attempt to strangle

660
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:58,231
the female
that sleeps in the bed.

661
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:04,370
The other thing
that she tries to do is,

662
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:08,544
she likes to enter nightmares
and create them.

663
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:13,380
And what she'll do
is get in there

664
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,250
and literally make the people

665
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,985
feel like
they're being chased by her.

666
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:19,418
Now, you guys
are sleeping in there,

667
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,383
and you're having nightmares
every frigging night.

668
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,085
Yeah.

669
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,690
I've had nightmares,
vivid nightmares.

670
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:28,357
It's always something violent.

671
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,693
Last night, I had one
of a parachute jump go wrong.

672
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,996
There was also
boating accidents,

673
00:35:35,998 --> 00:35:37,694
just horrible things like that.

674
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:41,498
Now, you mentioned that
it can get physical.

675
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,203
This is a picture of Nathaniel.

676
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,736
Oh, okay.

677
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:50,042
And he's been woken up
with scratches on him.

678
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,976
Wow.

679
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,747
It's happened a few times.

680
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:58,284
Another time, I put him to bed,

681
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,985
and he woke up in the morning,
and he had a long 8-inch scratch

682
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:04,220
right from the groin area
all the way down.

683
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:08,757
Is she capable of doing this
on Nathaniel like that?

684
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,994
Very possible.

685
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:14,062
Very.

686
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:17,166
Because what she's doing now
is just inflicting pain,

687
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:20,302
like, whether it's mentally,
emotionally, physically.

688
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,237
And now, she definitely
has her sights set

689
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,774
on two individuals
in the house.

690
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:28,245
One was the young boy.

691
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:31,347
And the other
is the lady of the house.

692
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,785
You're the only lady
in the house.

693
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:36,986
Mm-hmm.

694
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,287
Oh, boy.

695
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:43,391
What I got was that, you know,

696
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:45,559
she's trying to, like, you know,
really strangle you,

697
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:46,826
like, to death...

698
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:54,601
...and that she wants to get you
and then go after him.

699
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:58,472
I definitely got the sense

700
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,275
that she would go after him
big-time, too.

701
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:02,875
I feel sick right now.

702
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,183
She's trying to, like,
you know,

703
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:29,303
really strangle you,
like, to death.

704
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:36,130
And she wants to get you
and then go after him.

705
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:42,001
I feel sick right now.

706
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,951
You don't look surprised.

707
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:54,319
No.

708
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,254
I know the whole family,

709
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:59,022
and I saw what she did
to, basically, all of them.

710
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,569
You okay?

711
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,171
Yeah.

712
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:15,841
This is probably one of the
hardest reveals I've ever done.

713
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,443
Did you feel abused
when you were a kid?

714
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,479
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Oh, absolutely.

715
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:28,181
I'm just surprised
with Nathaniel.

716
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,284
She was always like that.

717
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,955
I mean,
does she really feel like

718
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:35,293
you guys just ruined her life,
or what?

719
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:38,163
Oh, yeah.
She had a hot temper, for sure.

720
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:44,036
Well, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear.

721
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:47,642
I know it's something
I didn't want to hear, either.

722
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:49,578
The big question left is,

723
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,112
is it safe for you
to raise Nathaniel in the house?

724
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,382
For that, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

725
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,052
What you need to deal with

726
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:04,022
is getting rid of
unwanted visitors, so to speak.

727
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:11,067
So, therefore, we kind of
want to put her to rest

728
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,068
so that you're not going to
have to deal with her.

729
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,838
Because my fear is that if
you don't take care of her now,

730
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,745
it's going to get worse.

731
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:21,880
It could be so debilitating,

732
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:25,351
I don't know
if you could get her out.

733
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,655
My suggestion is

734
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:32,761
to get an individual
that is a mental medium.

735
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:37,030
A mental medium
is a type of medium

736
00:39:37,032 --> 00:39:42,534
that does not feel
the individual's death.

737
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:48,169
Therefore, they won't be
as impacted by her.

738
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:50,504
So, what is this mental medium
going to do?

739
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:55,007
I would suggest
that they go in your backyard,

740
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,340
talk to her over two days.

741
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:01,478
What they're basically going to
be talking to her about

742
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,985
is letting her
tell them her story

743
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,352
to help her to move on.

744
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,589
Will she leave at that point?

745
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,091
Yes.

746
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:16,459
So, it sounds like the biggest
problem here is your mom.

747
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,593
Mm-hmm.

748
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:21,801
As far as she's concerned,

749
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:26,073
what I would suggest doing
is writing a letter to her.

750
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:30,815
In this letter,
I would like you to focus

751
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:33,619
on what she is no longer allowed
to do,

752
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:36,222
that she is no longer allowed

753
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:41,466
to control you, your home,
your family, or your dreams,

754
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:46,773
that you are taking back
the power and control

755
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,142
of your home and your family.

756
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:52,145
And then,
have a physical medium,

757
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:55,945
which is somebody like me,
come to the home.

758
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:59,649
And you and this physical medium
are going to deal with her.

759
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:04,051
Then, you're going to
read your letter.

760
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:05,787
I want you to yell.
I do.

761
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:08,388
I feel like you need to
fricking yell at her.

762
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,657
Don't let her stop you.

763
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:13,358
I don't care whether you feel
like you're going to throw up.

764
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,659
I don't care
if you do throw up.

765
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:17,997
I don't care what happens

766
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,169
as long as you finish
what you write.

767
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,406
Right.
Once you're done,

768
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:29,510
then you tell that physical
medium, "Get rid of her."

769
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,416
Are you afraid to do this?

770
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:38,586
Uh, anxious.

771
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:41,324
Once I get started,
I'll be on a roll.

772
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:44,495
I see how protective you are
of him.

773
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:46,129
Yes. I am very much.

774
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,699
What about you? Are you
going to take Amy's advice?

775
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:50,935
Yes, definitely.

776
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:52,770
I look forward to it.

777
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:55,640
Cynthia has her work
cut out for her.

778
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:59,175
But I believe if she's able
to stand up to her mother,

779
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:02,246
she'll free her family of
the evil that's tormenting them

780
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:05,183
and they'll be able to
live a peaceful life.
