1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,580
I think this girl's being murdered.

3
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,882
She's terrified.

4
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:16,584
There's something here.

5
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:19,519
Objects being thrown at people.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,156
She can't breathe.

7
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:24,492
- Scratches up here on my arm.
- That could be a problem.

8
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,960
Oh, my God. What's happening?

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,101
Something terrible's happened to her!

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,502
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:37,308
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,744
Something is not right.

13
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:40,848
I see dead people.

14
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,050
This person might have
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,019
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,378
You get those chills.

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,921
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,297
He is darkness. He is evil.

19
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:53,457
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,791
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,784
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:56,785 --> 00:01:00,870
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,398
Are you telling me the truth?

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,502
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:07,137
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:08,638
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,133
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,039
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,135
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,545
Until the very end.

31
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:16,947
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,982
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,123
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,291
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,892
It was like endless darkness.

36
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:46,639
Amy and I never communicate
during an investigation.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,584
I learn about the dead through
interviews and research.

38
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:53,268
While Amy speaks directly to them.

39
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,956
In the end, we meet up and reveal
our findings to each other...

40
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:59,369
And our clients for the first time.

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,415
I'm in Waxahachie, Texas, about
20 minutes south of Dallas.

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,434
I'm heading over to meet
with a woman named Shawn,

43
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:09,815
who owns a family restaurant in town.

44
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:11,870
She says things have
gotten so out of control,

45
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:16,459
she's worried about the safety
of her employees and her guests.

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,780
She says Amy and I are her last hope.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,783
I can't hide the fact
that this is a restaurant.

48
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,143
But I still need to be careful
to remove or cover any pictures,

49
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:40,784
signs, or decorations that
could influence Amy's findings.

50
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:06,207
In my opening, a Sheriff came up.

51
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,928
And he pointed to four graves.

52
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,576
I think he knew some of these guys.

53
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,277
And said that...

54
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:19,471
Those men had...

55
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:23,492
Caused a lot of fear at the time.

56
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,459
I'm getting a really weird smell.

57
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,695
What a weird smell! What is this?

58
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:33,576
Blood, it's blood.

59
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:37,866
I'm tasting it, yeah. Yeah, it's blood.

60
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,727
Ugh.

61
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,185
So, Shawn, you sounded pretty concerned
on the phone about what's going on here.

62
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,698
Yeah, we are... we are very concerned.

63
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,647
My daughter works up
here, she's 16 years old.

64
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:02,966
My mother, my husband,
and my dad are up here.

65
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,199
And we, you know, want
to make sure everything is

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,648
perfectly safe for everyone
that comes through that door.

67
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:12,568
Okay. So, give me an idea what kind
of experiences you guys are having.

68
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,460
Well, we've seen
apparitions, shadow people...

69
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:20,240
Things moving around, so it
pretty much runs the gamut.

70
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:23,307
- So, how long have you been here?
- I've been here for seven years.

71
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:26,723
Okay. And how long has
the activity been going on?

72
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,912
Forever, as far as I know.

73
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:30,490
So, why're you calling us in now?

74
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,729
Things have seemed to
kind of start picking up...

75
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,289
Like objects being thrown
at people in my kitchen,

76
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,800
and my daughter Amelia
was physically slapped.

77
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:44,006
So we're worried about her.

78
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:46,773
What do you hope we can do for you,
as far as the investigation goes?

79
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:49,975
I would like my children to be able to

80
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:53,148
pass on this legacy to
their children, and so on.

81
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:55,551
This is part of who we are.

82
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:58,509
Shawn, what about your customers?
Are they experiencing anything?

83
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,518
They have told me about a lot
of the things that are happening.

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,279
In fact, I have some ghost
logs that I'm gonna show you.

85
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,225
- Whoa, geez!
- These are some firsthand accounts...

86
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:15,146
That we have received
from some of our guests.

87
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:18,866
We have two more like that.

88
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,882
You're kidding?

89
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,743
Wow!

90
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:27,082
Now, what do you know about the history
of this place, I mean, it is pretty old?

91
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:32,635
Well, there's a legend about a love
triangle that occurred near this location.

92
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:35,017
Where a young lady was murdered.

93
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,512
Wow, okay. Why don't you
show me around the restaurant?

94
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:41,893
All right. Come on. Let's go this way.

95
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:58,867
I'm seeing this little
lady, like, about this tall.

96
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:01,111
And there's a male.

97
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,932
Her son, I think.

98
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,447
He's younger, 40s.

99
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:10,542
He's not nice.

100
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,098
It's really strange.

101
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,459
She feels so much stress.

102
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:17,946
Why?

103
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:21,847
Cause she can't leave here ever.

104
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,547
What's going on in this room
that you brought me in here?

105
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:38,448
There are all sorts of descriptions
in that log book as far as apparitions.

106
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:41,161
We get lots of reports on an older lady.

107
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,636
Any description on her?

108
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,438
That she wears glasses,
that's the only thing

109
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,467
that people have all
consistently said... glasses.

110
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:48,896
Okay.

111
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:52,772
And one of the things that
I have seen in this room is

112
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:57,371
some sort of shadowy figure
that appears under this table.

113
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,792
Really?

114
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,528
- It's like a solid figure.
- Okay.

115
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,445
And it's shaped like a person.

116
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:08,679
And we're positive it's not something
coming from the window, making it look...

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,819
- Yes, I'm absolutely, 100% positive.
- Why is that?

118
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,889
Occasionally, guests will say that
they felt something touching their leg.

119
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,969
Wow.

120
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,970
It's very upsetting.

121
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,658
The older woman and the son...

122
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:29,137
You know if anybody might have
experiences related to them?

123
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:34,966
I think that they might both be
seen um, as, like, apparitions.

124
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,887
Okay.

125
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,022
Her, though...

126
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:43,298
I definitely think she
would try to talk to people.

127
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,021
Okay.

128
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:49,256
And if she doesn't like something, I
think she would let people know somehow.

129
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:55,017
Are there any areas in particular
that they might be more?

130
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,814
In here.

131
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:18,273
Well, this is a busy kitchen, obviously
getting ready for the dinner crowd.

132
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,975
So why'd you bring me in here?

133
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:23,087
Just today, we were actually
standing over there and,

134
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:27,108
this glass just inexplainably broke.

135
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,197
- And nothing fell on top of it?
- No.

136
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:31,553
Did you hear the crack?

137
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,067
Yes, that's why we looked over there.

138
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,537
Wow. Anything else?

139
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,877
I have had what appeared to
be scratches, like three...

140
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:43,179
One, two, three, scratches
up here on my arm.

141
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,489
I was cooking, and I
thought I'd burned myself.

142
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,503
Well, that's my obvious question,
right? Did you burn yourself?

143
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,972
No. That's like a burn mark.

144
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:55,712
In my experience working with
Amy, that could be a problem.

145
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,516
Anything else in the kitchen?

146
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:01,917
I was here one day, and I'd see
something like a white apparition.

147
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:05,465
And it looked just like
a person walking back...

148
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,203
You know, like walking back and forth.

149
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,371
How tall would you say it was?

150
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,708
Probably about six feet tall.

151
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,981
It had arms and such.

152
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:16,402
Okay. What if Amy did tell you...

153
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:19,362
It's a little bit too dangerous here
to be here, for you and your guests?

154
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:22,742
That would just be sad, if it
was not something that I could...

155
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,720
Pass on to my daughter.

156
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:29,810
So I'm hoping that there's a solution
that will allow us to stay here.

157
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:32,091
All right.

158
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:37,316
This area's not good.

159
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,669
I'm seeing a weird shadow.

160
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,130
Of a female.

161
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,329
Her arms are long and thin.

162
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:55,762
She's stretching out.

163
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,921
Mm!

164
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,592
- Are you okay?
- No!

165
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:07,125
She can't feel her arms or legs.

166
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,918
And she can't breathe.

167
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,799
No... like [Bleep]!

168
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,951
Why are my arms so long?

169
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:20,165
Oh, my God. What's happening?

170
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:38,277
Why are my arms so long?

171
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,926
Oh, my God. What's happening?

172
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,173
Oh!

173
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,189
I'm not right.

174
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,357
She's not right anymore!

175
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:55,498
Something terrible's happened to her!

176
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:58,338
This woman is desperate
to tell her story.

177
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,296
So I'm doing something that I almost
never do because it's so dangerous.

178
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,601
Ow, my arms!

179
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:06,715
Oh, my God!

180
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,016
I'm letting her jump
me, or enter my body,

181
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,954
so she can speak through
me and I can feel her pain.

182
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:16,335
She can't find what she's looking for.

183
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,696
She's a mess. She's a mess.

184
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:26,977
Um, she does not understand
what's happened to her.

185
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,914
When you bought this place, did you
have any idea it might be haunted?

186
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,450
- No, I was a total skeptic.
- Okay, so what about now?

187
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,652
A lot different now. I
totally believe it now.

188
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,487
There's something here.

189
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,822
What changed your mind?

190
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,578
Well, I have a daughter,
a younger daughter.

191
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,859
- Right.
- She's eight now.

192
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,710
She was in the front
dining room one morning,

193
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,429
and I heard her talking to somebody.

194
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,358
So I asked her, I says, hey,
baby, who you playing with?

195
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:01,497
And she turned the other way and looked
up and then says, what's your name?

196
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:04,972
She asked somebody there what their
name was, and she wasn't talking to me.

197
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:07,905
- So, did she tell you a name or anything?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:09,885
- What'd she say?
- She said Eliza.

199
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:12,381
She said she wanted her
to stay with her tonight.

200
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,948
Okay. Anything else?

201
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,433
One time, I came in
through the back door,

202
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,688
and passed one of our... just a
manager who was working there...

203
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:23,428
And all of a sudden this loud bang
crash happened right behind me.

204
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:25,628
Well, what we call our fish racks...

205
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,941
Flew over his head and landed
in the middle of the kitchen.

206
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,391
I mean, I was shocked. I
didn't know what to think.

207
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:34,647
Now, do you think
whatever's here is dangerous?

208
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:37,098
Oh, yeah. It's very concerning,
you know, it's very upsetting.

209
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,380
Well let me ask you this,
would you be comfortable turning

210
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,844
this over to your daughter
right now and then walking away?

211
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,204
No, I don't think I would.

212
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:46,325
- You wouldn't?
- No.

213
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,480
She throws things.

214
00:12:55,481 --> 00:13:00,116
In here, in the kitchen.
I think that she...

215
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,065
Is talking all the time.

216
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:05,403
I think that they would feel...

217
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:07,480
The pains.

218
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,885
I think that...

219
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:12,065
She looks...

220
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,045
Scary.

221
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,326
To people.

222
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,611
She's trying to understand what...

223
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,623
Is going on.

224
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,604
She...

225
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,358
Keeps...

226
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,022
Seeing things that...

227
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,483
Frighten her.

228
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:43,676
She's getting panicked again.

229
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,198
It's okay...

230
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,539
It's okay.

231
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,356
So, Doctor, you're Shawn's dad.

232
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:09,064
- Yes.
- You're also a former Marine, like myself.

233
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,000
You're a scientist,
as well as an engineer.

234
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,501
That's correct.

235
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:16,171
Straight out blunt, is there
something going on in this place?

236
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:21,501
The unexplained events that
occurs in this restaurant.

237
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,030
Well, give me an idea
what we're talking about.

238
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:29,931
There was one situation in which I was
in the back, and I was cutting fish...

239
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,159
And someone says something to me, so I
laid the knife down on the cutting board...

240
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,806
- And I turned around to talk to him.
- Okay.

241
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,378
When I turned back around...

242
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,306
The knife was falling
from in front of me...

243
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,266
And stuck in the board.

244
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,704
I could see no explanation for it.

245
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:50,005
I can't even try to debunk it for you.

246
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,041
I find it very disconcerting.

247
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:55,222
There's a entity here.

248
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:59,578
Whether that entity is good or bad...

249
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,021
Is unknown...

250
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,776
But we don't take it lightly.

251
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:10,197
She has to figure it out.

252
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:16,523
Because when she figures it
out, it will all make sense.

253
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,539
Please tell me what you remember.

254
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,680
She's... And then I can't breathe.

255
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,096
The woman that's jumped
my body is struggling

256
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,613
to piece together
what's happened to her.

257
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:33,883
She's gasping for air, and
I'm feeling all of her pain.

258
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:36,353
And it hurts!

259
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:39,654
Like, she can't breathe.

260
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:46,566
I think this girl is being murdered.

261
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,602
Shawn told me there was a
legend about a love triangle

262
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:11,005
where a young girl was
murdered on the property.

263
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:16,906
So, I'm on my way to meet with the
local Police Chief to see if it's true.

264
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:23,126
My client said that there
was a female that was

265
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:26,361
murdered on their property,
some kind of a lover's quarrel.

266
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,862
Is there any truth to that at all?

267
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,931
Yes, actually there is.

268
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:35,832
April 30th of 1929, there was a young
lady murdered on that property area.

269
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,593
Okay, so it doesn't sound
like it happened in the

270
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,956
house I'm investigating,
but on the property.

271
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:46,397
Yes. The victim is this young lady here.

272
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,643
She was a 19-year-old
divorcee...

273
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:55,104
Miss Lola Roller, and this
Doctor, Dr. Harry Dowling...

274
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,822
Is apparently interested
in her in a romantic way.

275
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:03,186
Chief, do we know if they actually
ever had a relationship together?

276
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:05,265
No, indications are that they didn't.

277
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:08,751
I mean, he was 48 years old, she was 19.

278
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,123
She'd already told
members of her family that

279
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,472
she did not want a
relationship with him.

280
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,574
So, what does she wind up doing next?

281
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:19,489
She leaves the Temple area, comes
to Waxahachie to get away from him.

282
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,752
She comes up here, where her
Uncle lives, a Mr. H.L. Hempkins.

283
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:25,105
And she stays with him in his house.

284
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,686
He's a local grocer up here.

285
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,957
So, Hempkins lived on the plantation
property I'm investigating.

286
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,032
Correct.

287
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:37,138
So, she's at the house, and Dr.
Dowling finds out where she is.

288
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:43,039
And he is told by Mr. Hempkins that he's
not welcome, he's not gonna let him in.

289
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:45,827
Well, Dr. Dowling forced his way in.

290
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:49,963
So, Mr. Hempkins went
next door from his house...

291
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:53,059
To his grocery store
to retrieve his weapon.

292
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,944
And he also gets a hold of the Sheriff.

293
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:59,153
So, Chief, when the Uncle and the
Sheriff come back to the house...

294
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:03,290
- Is she already dead, what's going on?
- No, she's not dead at that time.

295
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,438
They find that Dowling and her

296
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,339
are involved in a physical
altercation going on at that time.

297
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,824
She feels like something's missing.

298
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:21,235
There's something missing.

299
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,067
A person, she's trying to find a person.

300
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:27,482
I hear the men, they're talking.

301
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:30,543
But it was too late.

302
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:35,336
There's, like, three... three of them.

303
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,385
I feel pain.

304
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,846
Some kind of pain.

305
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:48,402
The Sheriff can see that
Dr. Dowling has a weapon.

306
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:52,821
The Sheriff tries to get the
gun away from Dr. Dowling.

307
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,489
But he's unsuccessful.

308
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,062
And Dr. Dowling fires three
shots at the victim, Miss Lola.

309
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:58,912
Okay.

310
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:03,833
Hits her once in the
head, twice in the body.

311
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:08,549
Oh, God [Bleep]!

312
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:14,395
She can't move. She's so angry,
she can't move her [Bleep] legs.

313
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,217
I see...

314
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,549
How much it hurts.

315
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,270
Uh, and then I can't breathe.

316
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,359
I can't get the breath into my body.

317
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,106
And it hurts.

318
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,240
She thinks that she might be dying.

319
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,505
What happens next?

320
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:48,701
Well, Mr. Hempkins, from behind
the Sheriff, shoots Dr. Dowling.

321
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,425
And hits him in the head.

322
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:54,782
But there's also some question
that the good Doctor...

323
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:58,247
Had intended something, or
knew something might happen.

324
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,344
Because in his wallet was found a note,

325
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:04,046
that in case something happens,
contact either one of these two people.

326
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:07,140
Because I'm going to go get
the only woman I've ever loved.

327
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,311
Chief, this sounds like this must've
been some huge case back then.

328
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,669
Well, it was a pretty good-sized case,
obviously at that particular time,

329
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,355
but it's not the only one involving
ladies that have been killed in that area,

330
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:23,936
within one mile of the place
that you're talking about.

331
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,711
The story of Lola's murder is like
something right out of a movie.

332
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,906
It's hard to believe
there's several other cases

333
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,650
similar to that within a
mile of Shawn's restaurant.

334
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:47,220
I'm heading over to meet with
the County Sheriff, who's done the

335
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:53,121
research on those cases, and he
said it will definitely help my case.

336
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,439
You mentioned you found some
more cases very close to the

337
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,713
property I'm investigating,
similar to the Roller homicide.

338
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,913
- We did.
- Okay, what were you able to find out?

339
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:10,207
Ernest Feray, a 56-year-old
man, shot his wife, Amanda.

340
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,456
He shot her in the head
for throwing a vase at him.

341
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,753
Here's a picture of him in an article.

342
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,660
How far from the Catfish
Plantation did this homicide happen?

343
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,357
It's approximately.8 of a mile.

344
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:23,351
- Okay, so pretty close.
- Yes, Sir.

345
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:25,547
- Was there any other cases?
- Yes.

346
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,828
In 1914...

347
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,954
Thomas Hastings shot his 18-year-old wife,
mable, and then turned the gun on himself.

348
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:38,075
And they were both found in the
kitchen area of their apartment.

349
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:40,443
And how far from the plantation is this?

350
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:43,521
- This one was.7 of a mile, I believe.
- Okay.

351
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:46,179
Then, we had another one that was

352
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,180
approximately two blocks
from the Catfish Plantation.

353
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:54,663
On this one here is Charles
Allverson and his wife, Maggie.

354
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,978
Maggie was taking
medication for an illness,

355
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:01,902
and her husband, Charles, decided
to mix strychnine in the medication.

356
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,803
She died of a stomach poisoning.

357
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:08,139
This is another female
murdered by the husband.

358
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,125
You find this unusual
when you read about this?

359
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:11,229
Yes.

360
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,567
We have between 8 and
10 homicides a year.

361
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,580
And that's 990-square-miles.

362
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:20,621
Right. And these are four homicides
within a mile of the Catfish Plantation.

363
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:24,162
- Yep.
- That's interesting.

364
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:29,332
There's, um, a lot of people.

365
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:32,895
Um, and it's not safe.

366
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,818
Letting the murdered girl jump
me took almost all of my energy.

367
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,886
But now that she's out of my body,

368
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,901
there are other dead here
who are trying to communicate.

369
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:47,242
Something's happening, and
this woman's freaking out.

370
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:51,611
There's a lot of stomach pain.

371
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:55,019
Someone's saying, self-inflicted.

372
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,240
There was some kind of
love going on or something.

373
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:05,405
And it was horrible,
and it ended horribly.

374
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:07,266
Ugh.

375
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:12,904
Now that I know four women were
murdered within a mile of my

376
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,436
client's property, I need to see
if anything else went down there.

377
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:20,337
So, I head to the local library.

378
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,963
Searching through the archives, I
discover a former Major League ball player

379
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:28,452
named Paul Richards who used
to live on my client's land.

380
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:34,353
Turns out, he suffered a great
deal of loss in his time there.

381
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,265
So I reached out to a local
genealogist who says his

382
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:42,606
story is filled with fame,
tragedy, and family feuds.

383
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,770
The property I'm investigating was once

384
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:54,177
owned by one of Waxahachie's
most famous residents.

385
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,778
Well, that's true.

386
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,727
Paul Richards was a baseball player.

387
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,788
And I have a photo here of him.

388
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:05,124
In that photo, he's a
manager of the Orioles.

389
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,160
Now, you had mentioned on the phone
that he had some hardships in his life.

390
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:11,080
Sadly, he lost a
brother, a half-brother.

391
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,963
He was only 24 years old.

392
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:17,423
And then, later, he
lost his father, in 1937.

393
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:21,502
And then, Paul Richards lost
his six-year-old daughter.

394
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,138
Just three weeks before
his mother passed away.

395
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,528
So, I would imagine
it's got to be tough.

396
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:31,277
Very hard, but he and his mother
sometimes weren't on the best of terms.

397
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,714
I want to show you this photograph
of her in her later years.

398
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:39,750
Right after his windfall of winning
the pennant and getting some money.

399
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:42,792
He had indoor plumbing
installed in his mother's home.

400
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:44,669
- Okay.
- And, um, so...

401
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,995
I'm sure he thought that she would be very
pleased with that, but when he asked her,

402
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:53,896
she said to him that she would've
just as soon had a new dress.

403
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,709
To him, it was very serious,

404
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,610
and they were on the outs with
each other for a long, long time.

405
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,075
Her son.

406
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:09,556
She says that he's like...

407
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,494
Money-hungry.

408
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:15,254
She says she spoiled him badly.

409
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:18,534
And so she's kind of, like, upset.

410
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:20,949
Because he turned out that way.

411
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,430
And isn't a better person.

412
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:29,185
She says he definitely...

413
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:32,768
Exploited people for money.

414
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,028
And she's like, cause
I think he's the Devil.

415
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,757
You have any idea how he died?

416
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,443
He was playing golf.

417
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:46,510
At Waxahachie Country Club,
and he died of a heart attack.

418
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,391
At the age of 77.

419
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,262
I am getting a lot
of physical pain here.

420
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:02,125
Now, I'm getting, like... I'm getting,
like, maybe this is heart attack.

421
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:05,906
Yeah, definitely a heart attack.

422
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:11,648
I think this is her son.

423
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,754
I'm having a sketch artist draw the two

424
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:24,148
entities who stood out
the most from my walk.

425
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,209
First, the old woman.

426
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:29,860
She was...

427
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,646
Probably...

428
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,125
In her late 60s...

429
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,466
About 5'4.

430
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,522
She had smaller eyes.

431
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,611
Almond-shaped.

432
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:49,009
Next, the woman who jumped me, and
how she projects herself to the living.

433
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,273
She's kind of disfigured.

434
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:54,846
Her arms are...

435
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,506
Too long.

436
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:59,527
And her hair is like
sticking in clumps...

437
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:02,768
Out away from her head.

438
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:08,614
Is this what you saw?

439
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,651
Yes.

440
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,540
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

441
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:39,113
it's time to reveal our findings to our
clients and each other for the first time.

442
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:41,048
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Shawn and David.

443
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,330
They're married.

444
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:45,348
They're part owners of the
Catfish Plantation restaurant.

445
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:46,883
It's a family business.

446
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:50,487
Actually, her parents work there,
as well as your 16-year-old daughter.

447
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,122
And that's where the problem comes in.

448
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:56,195
There's a lot of activity in this
place, and their concern is...

449
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,219
Is it safe for them, their
family, and their guests?

450
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,469
And, they would like to eventually
turn it over to their kids.

451
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,400
They called us in to see if
there's a solution for it.

452
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:11,301
So, with that, I'm gonna have Amy
tell us a little bit about her walk.

453
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:17,013
When I went in, these two dead
people met me right at the door.

454
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:22,419
It was an elderly little lady,
and a male who might be her son.

455
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,175
And she told me...

456
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,051
That he is...

457
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:29,881
Not a very nice person.

458
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:32,898
He was very money-hungry.

459
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:37,227
And then, I was feeling
symptoms of a heart attack.

460
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:40,653
As far as interactions with the living.

461
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:44,778
People might see them as apparitions.

462
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,028
One day, we were at the restaurant, our
youngest daughter was up there with us,

463
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,780
and she was in the front
playing, just being a kid.

464
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:53,160
And I came around the corner,
I could hear her talking,

465
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:56,403
and it was an imaginary
friend, I'm sure.

466
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,588
And as I listened to her for a few
moments, some of the things she was saying

467
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:03,351
made me believe that it was almost like
a motherly or a grandmother-type figure.

468
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,629
Wanting her to spend the night.

469
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,312
Interesting.

470
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,122
Now, I wanted to tell you
about the Richards family

471
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,133
that lived in this
house for about 45 years.

472
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:15,525
Paul Richards was a
mediocre baseball player,

473
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:18,366
but a pretty good manager
in the Major Leagues.

474
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,836
And he lived here in
this house with his mom.

475
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:23,279
- Oh.
- I actually have a photo of him.

476
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,400
This is Paul Richards.

477
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,509
He had some heartbreak in his life.

478
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,651
He had a 24-year-old half-brother
who died from Tuberculosis.

479
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:36,317
In 1951, his six-year-old daughter
died from a tear in the heart.

480
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,975
Three weeks later, his mother
fell, and she died a few days later.

481
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,071
Hmm.

482
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,956
Now, Amy, you mentioned
that the older woman

483
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:45,617
kind of thought he was
money-hungry in life.

484
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:49,690
Well, the mom and Paul
Richards had an argument...

485
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:52,949
Over money and didn't talk after that.

486
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,104
But after he wins the World Series,
and comes into some money, obviously...

487
00:29:57,105 --> 00:30:01,384
Um... he goes ahead and buys her
indoor plumbing for the house.

488
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,854
She turns around and says, well, why,
you should've just bought me a new dress.

489
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:07,666
- You also mentioned a heart attack.
- Yes.

490
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:11,761
He did die of a heart attack, on
a golf course right in Waxahachie.

491
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:14,042
Geez, wow.

492
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:17,982
Now, I have a picture of his
mom, Sarah, when she was older.

493
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:22,972
It couldn't have been too
long before she passed, either.

494
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:26,753
I have a younger photo of her.

495
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:29,379
What a difference.

496
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,099
- We've seen her.
- Really?

497
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,439
Mm-hmm.

498
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,740
That's giving me chills.

499
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:39,853
I saw her in between these ages.

500
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,663
And I did do a sketch of her.

501
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:44,944
All right.

502
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,836
Well, you guys take a look.

503
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:56,137
- Mm hmm.
- Holy smokes.

504
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,828
Wow.

505
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:03,581
They're very similar.

506
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,981
The hair is, you know, right on.

507
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:10,439
The brow, and the ridge line right
there, right above the nose...

508
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,160
All seem to be very right on.

509
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:18,861
- You think this is who you might've seen?
- Probably, yeah.

510
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:23,549
She was showing me a
lot of different scenes.

511
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,957
Or situations that she
had seen in her life.

512
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:32,124
What I could see and make out of
them, ended, like, with people dead.

513
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:35,697
The one that I could make the most...

514
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:39,383
Sense out of was about a female.

515
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:44,006
I started getting really
bad stomach pains, and...

516
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:48,125
Someone out of these dead people
said that it was self-inflicted.

517
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:53,330
There was love involved, and
that it ended just horribly.

518
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:58,134
From 1914 to 1929, there
were four women murdered...

519
00:31:58,135 --> 00:32:01,862
- What? What?
- Within a mile radius of the restaurant.

520
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:06,095
Now, I think the murder you're talking
about is this woman, Maggie Allverson.

521
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,711
She had been sick with
some stomach ailments...

522
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:11,614
- Okay.
- And she was taking medication.

523
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:15,664
Her husband, Charles, decided to
mix the medication with strychnine.

524
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:18,199
And wound up killing her with it.

525
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,208
Now...

526
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,123
- Nice.
- Yeah.

527
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:24,093
This is her death certificate
here, Maggie Allverson.

528
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:27,429
She was about 40 years old when she died.
He was a little bit younger. He was 34.

529
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,098
This only happened two blocks...

530
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:31,567
- Oh!
- From the restaurant.

531
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:34,787
It was close. So she probably knew her.

532
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,768
I mean, it's a small town, everybody
knows everybody in this size town.

533
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,231
- Yes.
- Wow. Hmm.

534
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:42,712
Makes so much sense to me.

535
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:44,701
What else you see?

536
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:48,018
I was in the bathroom area.

537
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:52,918
And I started to get this
really intense, negative feeling,

538
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,809
like when you're almost
in a car accident.

539
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,874
I felt a woman near me.

540
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:02,167
And then I did something
that I very rarely do...

541
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:05,408
And I let her jump me.

542
00:33:06,844 --> 00:33:11,802
She stayed with me for
about a half an hour or so.

543
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:12,779
Wow.

544
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,421
So, were you in control
or you don't remember?

545
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:18,782
Um, initially, I was not.

546
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,238
Is she trying to communicate
through you, or what was going on?

547
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:25,816
Well, I can show you, because...

548
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:30,497
- We have Matt's cameras.
- Let me see it.

549
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,464
Oh, my God, what's happening?

550
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:37,599
Ow, my arms!

551
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,602
Oh, my God!

552
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,570
I'm not right!

553
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:45,231
She's just not right anymore!

554
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:49,579
Something terrible happened to her!

555
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,597
I don't even know what
to say about this, I don't

556
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,033
like that you did it,
to be honest with you.

557
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,019
What is this woman's deal?
What's the story with her?

558
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,721
She's very confused and scared.

559
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:03,502
She's constantly reliving her...

560
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:06,238
Her death.

561
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:10,753
She doesn't understand
at all what is going on.

562
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:14,465
She was waiting, I think, for
somebody to come and get her.

563
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:17,393
She saw some men...

564
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:20,694
Um, come in towards her.

565
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:24,078
- She said, I think I'm dying.
- Oh, no!

566
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,183
Um, and then she was like trying to
make her body breathe, and it couldn't.

567
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:33,564
I got a lot of pain here, in my neck.

568
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:36,841
Um, and the front of my chest.

569
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:40,195
So, I think at that point she was
probably dead but still inside her body.

570
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,663
That's awful.

571
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,758
I think I have an
answer, but I'm not sure.

572
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:45,731
Remember I told you there
was four women murdered?

573
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:47,001
- Right.
- Okay.

574
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:52,902
One of the women that was murdered, died,
not in the house, but on the property.

575
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:55,643
Back in 1929 on April 30th.

576
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,978
Her name was Lola Roller.

577
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,996
She was 19 years old.

578
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,672
This is her.

579
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:04,585
She lived in Temple, which
is about 100 miles from here.

580
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:09,327
She came up here to get away from a
48-year-old Doctor. He was a veterinarian.

581
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:11,147
His name was Dr. Harry Dowling,

582
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:14,194
who fell in love with her, and
she wanted nothing to do with him.

583
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,697
They never even had a
relationship together.

584
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,132
She comes up here to
stay with her Uncle.

585
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,401
Somehow, he finds out she's up here.

586
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:25,906
He drives up, finds out the house she's
in, goes to the door, knocks on it.

587
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:28,776
The Uncle answers, says, you're
not allowed in here, get away!

588
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:31,879
He had a grocery store
next to the house.

589
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,768
He went there to go get his
gun and then get the Sheriff.

590
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:40,460
When they come back, somehow
Dr. Dowling got into the house.

591
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:43,798
And when the Uncle
and the Sheriff arrive,

592
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,832
he's got her and they're
in a physical altercation.

593
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,128
The Doctor, he's got a gun in his hand.

594
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:53,916
The Sheriff tried to gun away from him, a
fight ensues, there's a big fight going on.

595
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:57,204
And the Doctor he puts one
in her head, two in her chest.

596
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,125
Whoa.

597
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,571
The Uncle, he puts one into
the Doctor's head and kills him.

598
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:07,164
The thing that really
bothers her is that she...

599
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,783
Sees herself very strangely.

600
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:12,316
She does not know that she's dead.

601
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:14,621
To her, she's still fighting.

602
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:18,125
- It's very confusing.
- It's sad.

603
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:21,850
The way that she sees herself...

604
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:24,834
Is basically like a shadow.

605
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:27,469
And her limbs are...

606
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,787
Extremely long and thin.

607
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:34,434
I kind of thought that that's maybe
how living people would see her.

608
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:35,238
Okay.

609
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,216
Like a female shadow
that's kind of distorted.

610
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:41,849
I'm having a little trouble understanding
how that would actually look.

611
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,210
Well, I did do a sketch.

612
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:56,569
That's odd.

613
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,623
Take a look at that.

614
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,684
Wow, I've seen that.

615
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,928
I did do a sketch.

616
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,211
That's odd.

617
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:30,523
Take a look at that.

618
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:37,254
Wow, I've seen that.

619
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:44,888
This is very upsetting to me.

620
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,807
It's a dark figure.

621
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:53,708
That crouches underneath the
tables in the burgundy dining room.

622
00:37:54,932 --> 00:38:00,832
So, is it possible that the
shadow thing she's seen is Lola?

623
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,458
Yes.

624
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:13,075
What does she do? I mean...

625
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:15,476
Well, she...

626
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,498
Will break things...

627
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:23,899
She'll throw things around,
especially in the kitchen.

628
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:29,358
She is always screaming
and yelling and crying.

629
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,814
Wow.

630
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:35,195
- Can she become frustrated?
- Oh, yeah.

631
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,622
We have our racks that
we use for cooking.

632
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:43,126
And I was almost out of the
kitchen, and they flew off the shelf,

633
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:46,907
and flew over our assistant manager's
head and landed behind... right behind me.

634
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,068
Oh, wow.

635
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:54,090
Now, one of the biggest reasons
we're here is she's been scratched.

636
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:56,550
On her left arm.

637
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,284
Show Amy where you were scratched.

638
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:01,871
It was just right like that.

639
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,091
Just like three fingernail marks.

640
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,952
Wow.

641
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,199
Yeah.

642
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,331
That's her.

643
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,224
The scratches, I think, are...

644
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:21,555
Something that occurred
during the struggle.

645
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:23,460
Okay.

646
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,551
I'm very sorry for her.

647
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:29,476
I knew these things weren't
just happening for no reason,

648
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:34,277
that someone was trying
to tell us something.

649
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,752
We still haven't answered
your most pressing question...

650
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:45,287
Is it gonna be safe here for
you, your family, your guests?

651
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:49,218
And, even more importantly, is it gonna
be okay for you to pass it on to your kids?

652
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,205
Right.

653
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:55,306
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

654
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:57,979
We'll start with the mother and son.

655
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,996
A local medium needs to come in.

656
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,577
And talk to...

657
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,584
Her.

658
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:08,491
You know, she has so much anger.

659
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:12,601
She needs to talk about,
you know, her life.

660
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:14,813
And the things that
are keeping her here.

661
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:15,931
Okay.

662
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:18,619
Once these two have spoken.

663
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,650
Let the medium do whatever they need to.

664
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:25,573
Um, to make sure that they move on.

665
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:31,474
As far as she's concerned, this
is a little bit more detailed.

666
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:35,343
There are two people you need for this.

667
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:39,514
You get another medium,
and a grief counselor.

668
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,948
So, they have to come together,
the medium and the counselor?

669
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,253
Yes.

670
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:45,463
Okay.

671
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:48,366
The medium might get jumped.

672
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:52,956
So, they should take
this slow and steady.

673
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:55,602
Um, with several meetings.

674
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:56,742
Okay.

675
00:40:56,743 --> 00:41:01,770
By the third meeting, the
start of therapy begins.

676
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:04,994
This is when the grief counselor...

677
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:10,895
Will really take over as far as
counseling this person who's dying.

678
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:16,125
We're dealing with somebody,
again, who is extremely traumatized,

679
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:19,402
because she's never moved on.

680
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:24,968
And at first, you know, things
might become more active...

681
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:28,002
Because she might be pissed.

682
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:31,342
But that should just be
temporary until she leaves.

683
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:33,478
I've got to ask the question
I ask all my clients...

684
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:37,356
Are you gonna take Amy's
advice and do what she says?

685
00:41:37,357 --> 00:41:40,685
I think that we need to
help Lola, definitely.

686
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:43,400
Absolutely, cause, I mean,
it's almost terrifying

687
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:47,610
just to think about
what she's going through.

688
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:51,031
We feel compelled to help.

689
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,768
Lola continues to suffer in death.

690
00:41:54,769 --> 00:42:00,159
But if Shawn and David follow my advice,
I'm confident she will be set free.

691
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,060
And they'll be able to safely pass
their restaurant on to their children.
