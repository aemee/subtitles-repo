1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,562
I think they see him.

3
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,502
We have a gremlin crawling
up on the ceilings.

4
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:19,973
It's kind of like a shadow person.

5
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:21,681
He's bad.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:24,681
I see a lot of blood.

7
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:27,100
I'm not gonna let something
drive us out of our home.

8
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:30,060
I feel very panicked.

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,822
This is a terrible place. I hate it.

10
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,423
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:38,392
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,518
Something is not right.

13
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:41,720
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,760
This person might have
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,602
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,457
You get those chills.

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,955
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:51,503
He is darkness. He is evil.

19
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:54,346
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:56,234
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:57,676
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,677 --> 00:01:01,721
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,055
Telling me the truth?

24
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:06,268
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,829
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,469
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,909
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,136
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:15,291
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:16,792
Until the very end.

31
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:17,929
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,801
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,078
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,175
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:27,016
That was, like, endless darkness.

36
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:53,232
Amy and I work the same case,
but from two separate angles.

37
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:58,771
I interview living witnesses and look for
secrets buried deep in the property's past.

38
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:02,372
While Amy talks to the dead.

39
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:06,197
I'm in the tiny town of
Cressona, Pennsylvania.

40
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:09,092
It's a couple hours outside of Philly.

41
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:11,626
I got a call from a man named Randy.

42
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:14,722
Randy and his fiancée
are both Army veterans.

43
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:17,177
And they both know what it's
like to be in a war zone.

44
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,587
They just never expected to
find one in their own home.

45
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:25,088
I'm hoping Amy and I can help them out.

46
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,070
Before Amy enters a location,

47
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:36,603
I need to remove anything that
could influence her findings.

48
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:41,236
This house is filled with family
photographs and military memorabilia.

49
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:46,757
So I need to conceal all
of it before tonight's walk.

50
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,491
There's this really
tall, really skinny...

51
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:08,846
Weird...

52
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:10,817
Crazy...

53
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,075
Guy.

54
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,993
He has, like, a long cape.

55
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,334
And a hat.

56
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:25,061
He is very excited for
us to be here tonight.

57
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,075
Because he...

58
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,790
Thinks he's all that as far as...

59
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:34,711
Being able to mess with
people and scare them.

60
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:39,294
He said, I'll see you
soon. I can't wait.

61
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,862
Like, you'll know when
you get there. Uh...

62
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:45,583
You know, what I'm all about.

63
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:03,503
Now, Randy, I understand you and
your fiancée, Angela, have got

64
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:06,126
some pretty serious things going
on here for you to call us in.

65
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,596
- Yes.
- Give me an idea what's going on.

66
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:11,527
There's apparitions. There's shadows.

67
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:15,232
There's been things moved from one
area of the house to a completely

68
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,434
different area of the house
that I know nobody has touched.

69
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,569
Now, is everybody in the
house being affected by this?

70
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,745
- Yes.
- Who lives in the house?

71
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:26,495
Myself, Angela, my two
daughters... 8 and 11...

72
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,198
And my stepson, who's 9.

73
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,482
- Are they frightened to be in the house?
- Samantha is.

74
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:34,802
Samantha actually lived here with me last
year for the school year and moved out

75
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,359
because now she's so afraid,
she doesn't want to move back.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,196
- That's got to be heartbreaking for you.
- It is. It is.

77
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,064
That's my little girl.

78
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,137
It's hard to be a father and protect
your children when you can't...

79
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:49,137
How do you protect them
against something like that?

80
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,905
Do you guys ever consider
moving out of here?

81
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,106
It's not an option.

82
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,450
Monetarily, we couldn't afford to move.

83
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,058
Secondly, this is the best
school district in the area,

84
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:59,661
and we want our children to grow
up in a secure, safe environment.

85
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,501
- Okay.
- And this is it.

86
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,468
Okay, do you know
anything about the house?

87
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,619
A little. I know that
the houses were built for

88
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,498
the employees of the rail road
by the owner of the rail road.

89
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,263
Now, are there any parts
of the house you can

90
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,566
show me where you've
experienced or seen things?

91
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,599
Actually, there is.
This area right here.

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,476
- You've seen stuff here?
- I have.

93
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,769
What did you see?

94
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,905
It's kind of like a shadow person.

95
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,841
Okay, so how often do you see it?

96
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:29,277
- A few times a night.
- A few times a night?

97
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:34,216
Could it be lights coming in from
outside or some kind of reflection issue?

98
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:38,897
No. Not in that
direction. It couldn't be.

99
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:43,191
Do you know if this tall guy
interacts with the living here?

100
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:45,126
Yes, he does.

101
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,247
I think they see him.

102
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,690
He makes them scared, he stares at them.

103
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,605
Is there any particular
reason that he does this?

104
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,886
He's bad.

105
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:07,548
Okay, Randy, so what's going on in here?

106
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:11,347
I'll get migraines for a whole day, and
I've never, ever had headaches before.

107
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:16,123
One evening, I had a headache so
badly that I couldn't even walk.

108
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:20,136
And that was followed by a tightness...

109
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,743
Almost like a constricting of
my chest like I couldn't breathe.

110
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:25,934
I had to leave the area, and once I
left the area, it started to dissipate.

111
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:29,975
- You think you were having a heart attack?
- Honestly, yes, I did at first.

112
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:35,876
It feels almost as if something is sitting
on you, at the same time, squeezing you.

113
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,002
Okay.

114
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:46,648
Like, it hurts, and I can't
breathe because of the pressure.

115
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:50,224
This is the tall, creepy guy.

116
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:55,095
And he's like, I'm gonna suck
the [Bleep] life out of you.

117
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,431
He doesn't want me to
get anything about him.

118
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:00,201
He's getting really mad.

119
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:05,874
Ah, and he's really loud, too,
and he's like blowing in my ear.

120
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,935
The people feel that.

121
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:13,255
He said, oh, yeah, I
thought you could handle me.

122
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:16,736
And I said, I can [Bleep].

123
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:20,187
Randy, you got a lot going
on that you're experiencing.

124
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:21,963
I mean, is there anything else?

125
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,677
Sounds like there's
things up in the attic.

126
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:27,386
There's loud bumps,
bangs, noises in the attic.

127
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:29,775
It's just a really weird, eerie feeling

128
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:32,601
like you're constantly
being followed or watched.

129
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:36,202
In fact, I make sure I take my steps very
carefully when I go up and down the steps

130
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,973
because I feel like something
will push me down the steps.

131
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,302
You know, Randy, I got
to ask you. I mean...

132
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:47,114
Stuff you've told me so far, I don't think
I would stay here, to be honest with you.

133
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:50,153
- I don't know. How are you doing it?
- Because this is our children's home.

134
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,237
I'm not gonna let something
drive us out of our home.

135
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,879
This is the home that
we've always wanted.

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,158
Has this taken a strain
on your personal life?

137
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,885
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir.

138
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,752
We've been getting
further and further apart.

139
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:04,248
- Really?
- Yeah. She's my soul mate.

140
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,168
I've always believed for the last
20-something years she's my soul mate.

141
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,370
Okay. Do you think it's
because of the house?

142
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,805
I believe so.

143
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:15,666
I truly believe it has
a lot to do with it.

144
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,137
These stairs are so bad.

145
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:34,629
- Why?
- They are an issue.

146
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,398
They're a [Bleep] problem.

147
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,988
- What happens?
- I think they fall down them.

148
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:46,889
I got to say this is up there
with my top 10 of hatred places.

149
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,447
I feel panicked, confused...

150
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,328
Scared, overwhelmed.

151
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,253
It's a terrible,
terrible, terrible place.

152
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,594
I hate it.

153
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:07,119
- This is your youngest daughter's?
- Yes, this is the 8-year-old's room.

154
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,512
Okay, what's going on in here?

155
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:14,413
She had described to me a large, dark
figure with a cape and a hook hand.

156
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,317
That's scary for anybody,
let alone an 8-year-old.

157
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,975
The way I understand it,
she sees it pretty often.

158
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,632
Okay, anything else in this room?

159
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,180
She's deathly afraid of the closet.
She had me draw crosses on her closets.

160
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,916
All right, so what is she
afraid of about the closet?

161
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,471
She never went into detail. She
just doesn't like the closets.

162
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,254
She won't even go in
the closet by herself.

163
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,290
How do you protect somebody like that?

164
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,822
I'm supposed to be the protective
figure. That's my role as a father.

165
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,722
I don't even know the kid, and
my heart's breaking for her.

166
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:46,483
If I think about it, I get
emotional. That's my daughter.

167
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,776
You can feel the fear
that these people feel.

168
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:56,837
He likes the closets.

169
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,182
It doesn't really care for children.

170
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,063
They're easy mark.

171
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,455
The tall, thin man is making
his presence felt in every room.

172
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:12,212
He likes to torment adults, but now
I see his real issue is with children.

173
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,397
Why do you say that?

174
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:20,326
He's like, oh, I'm gonna [Bleep] with your
head if you're gonna [Bleep] with my head.

175
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,171
And what is he doing?

176
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:25,407
He's just making me dizzy
and feel like I want to vomit.

177
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:26,742
I want to puke.

178
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:30,246
I feel like someone's
pushing my throat in...

179
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:33,382
Just smushing me right here.

180
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,617
Right here.

181
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,119
Like that.

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Just smushing it in really hard.

183
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:05,523
Randy mentioned you guys fight a lot.

184
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:09,461
But at the same time, he says you're
his soul mate, so what's the story?

185
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:14,334
I think it's something
in the house trying to...

186
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,944
- Come between you?
- Yeah.

187
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,037
So, what are some of the
things you're experiencing?

188
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,708
Every night, we have a gremlin
crawling up on the ceilings.

189
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,316
- A gremlin?
- Yep.

190
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:29,217
2 feet tall, dark green with black
scales going down the back of him.

191
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,266
I've heard a lot of bizarre
stories working cases with Amy.

192
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,499
But when a witness tells
me she's seen a gremlin,

193
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,335
I need to know where her head is at.

194
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,925
I got to ask a question you may not
like, but are you on medications?

195
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,726
No.

196
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,396
Anything else going on?

197
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:48,963
I get the occasional poking in
the back, hair pulling at night.

198
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,870
- Okay.
- And it's not Randy.

199
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:53,268
No, Randy's downstairs.

200
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:55,936
- How the hell are you sleeping at night?
- I don't sleep.

201
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,243
I have a reoccurring nightmare.

202
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,807
I'm laying in bed, and...

203
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:07,227
the Devil comes up and puts his arms around
me and is pulling me through the bed,

204
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:10,226
through the first floor, and
once we hit the basement...

205
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:13,507
He turns around and he
says, I finally got you.

206
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,394
By then, I'm usually screaming,
and Randy wakes me up.

207
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,255
Wow.

208
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:25,254
I see this woman.

209
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:28,348
And she's screaming.

210
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:32,863
And I'm seeing...

211
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,755
The tall, creepy guy.

212
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,415
But his face is always changing.

213
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,401
This tall, creepy guy is
able to read people's minds

214
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:43,036
and project back their
most horrible fears.

215
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:47,238
He's very advanced and has
mastered his physical environment.

216
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:52,880
I think they feel like he might be poking
them, but he's actually grabbing them.

217
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:56,311
He makes them have nightmares.

218
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:59,072
Bad... he's bad.

219
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:09,186
You all right? I saw you grab
your rosary beads on the way down.

220
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,039
What are you feeling
when you come down here?

221
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,463
I just get the overwhelming feeling
like you don't belong down here.

222
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,398
I just feel evil.

223
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,628
Look, I understand you having that
dream makes you not want to come into the

224
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:23,241
basement, but is there anything else down
here that wants you to keep out of here?

225
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:27,589
Yes, one night, I was
home alone, and um...

226
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,757
I heard banging and growling and
scratching coming from the basement door.

227
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,050
I grabbed my rosaries,
I put them on the door,

228
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,235
and I went out and I sat
outside waiting for Randy.

229
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,372
Could it have been an animal that got
into the house and was trying to get out?

230
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:41,531
No.

231
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:44,944
The back doors... both sets of back
doors were locked from the inside.

232
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:48,763
And once you go down into the
basement, my rosaries were gone.

233
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:49,617
Really?

234
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:54,135
I found them a week later, and
they were broken in the closet.

235
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,733
I almost had a heart attack.

236
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,156
And what do you think's down here?

237
00:13:57,157 --> 00:14:00,997
I think the Devil is down here.

238
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,402
There's, like, this old woman,
and she's, like, crying and...

239
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:16,365
Oh, no, no, and so sad.

240
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:22,246
She's creepy. Like, she puts
her hand on me and it's ice.

241
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:31,043
She knows this house, and this
house is full of people who...

242
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:35,544
Are really running
away from their lives.

243
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:44,830
There is something else I
wanted to explain to you.

244
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:49,234
One of the things that I
feel may be behind it all...

245
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,073
Is my mother.

246
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:53,862
- My mother passed away in '98.
- What did she die of?

247
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:55,773
She died of bone-marrow cancer.

248
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,517
- She was 36.
- She was 36?

249
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:01,846
I had some issues with my mother.

250
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,579
We'd try to make amends,
but it didn't happen.

251
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,941
I feel tremendous guilt.

252
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:10,320
I absolutely understand
what you're talking about.

253
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,457
Same thing happened
to me with my father.

254
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:18,358
I didn't get to say goodbye. We
had an argument the night he died.

255
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:25,325
That was 33 years ago, and
I still have guilt about it.

256
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,906
And if I can do that night over...

257
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:30,985
I'd do that night over in a minute.

258
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:35,992
Unfortunately, before she died, we never
had a chance to say goodbye to each other.

259
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:40,433
So I do believe that my mother is here.

260
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:50,513
I want to say that this
old lady is somehow...

261
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:55,225
Related to the house or related
to the people in the house now.

262
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:59,013
She keeps saying that
she's very sorry...

263
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,865
About everything that's happened.

264
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,526
Somehow, she feels responsible.

265
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,405
I think she knew someone bad... a male.

266
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:15,306
He was trying to hide it... but
she knew she could've stopped...

267
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:21,348
It from happening, but she
didn't do anything about it.

268
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,287
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,199
Something about cancer.

270
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,397
I think she died from it.

271
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,166
Do you know when this was?

272
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,447
Late '90s.

273
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:38,336
I don't know.

274
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:42,945
She might be death come to this house.

275
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:46,726
She's coming to take the lady.

276
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:01,937
Randy mentioned that one man
owned the entire town of Cressona.

277
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,144
That actually sounds like a pretty
good place to start my investigation.

278
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,433
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

279
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:13,834
who says the town's father
left a very mixed legacy.

280
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,264
John Chapman Cresson was
the founder of Cressona.

281
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:29,392
In 1847, he became the President of the
Mine Hill and Schuylkill Haven Railroad.

282
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:32,850
Which ran through Cressona.
This is his picture.

283
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:38,751
His contemporaries describe him as quite
a tall man with very expressive eyes.

284
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:42,230
Now, Rick, did he get rich just from
being the President of the company?

285
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:46,774
No, he made the lion's share of his money
through land and property acquisition.

286
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,111
We have a sales agreement here.

287
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:55,012
Where in 1847, when he became President,
he purchased 200 acres for $9,000.

288
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,774
He was a very shrewd businessman.

289
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,810
And how's it go from
the land into a town?

290
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,499
What John Cresson did is he broke
the land up into individual plots,

291
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,383
and had homes built on the plots.

292
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:12,088
And then what he did is he sold
them to the rail road workers.

293
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,799
So, on one hand, he was
putting money into their pocket,

294
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,212
and on the other hand, taking it out.

295
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,830
So, what wound up happening with this
guy? What, did he stay in the area?

296
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:24,789
Well, as much as he built up
the economy of Cressona, he also

297
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,493
pretty much ruined it in 1864.

298
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:30,930
What he did was he leased the
rail line to the Reading Railroad.

299
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:35,784
And by doing that, it outsourced a
lot of the employees from Cressona,

300
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:38,194
and the jobs weren't
here as much anymore.

301
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:41,645
So, during all this recession time,
he's still making a lot of cash.

302
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,103
Yes, he is.

303
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,522
So, it sounds like this
guy's kind of ruthless.

304
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:50,383
He was. He was a true
capitalist of the day.

305
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:57,577
I think that this is
the tall, creepy guy.

306
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,750
He does not want...

307
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,041
Anybody to know who he is.

308
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,990
Do you know how he looked in life?

309
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:10,512
Well, he was taller than average.

310
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:15,721
I think he had, like, kind of a
slender face, a kind of a hook nose.

311
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,002
Dark eyes.

312
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:21,399
He's saying, stop, stop!

313
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,197
Because I'm, like, trying
to get into his head.

314
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,099
Able to get any more
about what he did in life?

315
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,124
I think he sells a variety
of merchandise, I think.

316
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,971
And I know he's bad.

317
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:41,712
And I know he was a
very, very bad person.

318
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:48,424
I need to find out everything I
can about my client's property.

319
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:51,768
So I head to the local library.

320
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,040
Digging through the archives,

321
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,358
I discover a deadly rail road crash in
1892 involving a man named John Gray.

322
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,339
Turns out he used to
live in my clients' home.

323
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:08,593
So, I've reached out to
a local train historian,

324
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:13,754
who tells me this tragedy
could've been prevented.

325
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:21,697
Now, Dale, you mentioned
that this guy John Gray was in

326
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:24,135
the middle of this train
wreck that I had read about.

327
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:25,394
What did you mean by that?

328
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:28,938
Well, he was responsible for
maintaining equipment as a Foreman.

329
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,269
And foremen generally
were involved with making

330
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,619
sure locomotives were repaired properly.

331
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,409
Dale, can you explain exactly
how the train wreck went down?

332
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,474
It happened at 2:00 in the
morning on a cold November night.

333
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,270
And this is especially
tragic because the crew

334
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,425
brought this train to
Cressona from Reading.

335
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:48,877
And another crew had gotten on to
replace them to take the train North,

336
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:52,071
so instead of having three men
on the locomotive, there were six.

337
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:55,309
And just two minutes later,
the locomotive exploded

338
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,486
and killed five of them, and the
other man died later in the hospital.

339
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:01,720
- So, two sets of crews gets killed.
- Correct.

340
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:05,793
In connection to my clients' property,
how far away from that was the explosion?

341
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,646
Basically, just down the hill.

342
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:10,064
This is what a boiler
explosion looks like.

343
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:12,795
That's not that actual locomotive but,

344
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:16,320
a photograph of a steam locomotive
that had a boiler explosion.

345
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:18,644
Okay, we don't have any photos
of that explosion itself?

346
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,753
No, we don't.

347
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:22,017
- Okay, was anybody ever charged?
- No.

348
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:24,105
So, Dale, I got to assume,
in a small town like this,

349
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:27,110
this had to be the biggest
accident they ever had.

350
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:32,268
Well, it was up until that time.
But in 1918, the Spanish Flu hit.

351
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:38,169
Interestingly, John Gray's son, James,
was a Doctor in the town at that time.

352
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:45,052
Something doesn't want me back here.

353
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:49,602
I'm, like, hearing yelling.

354
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:53,443
I feel panicked... very panicked.

355
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:57,534
I am seeing, like,
all of these men dying.

356
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:02,606
I don't know if it's 1870
or something. I don't know.

357
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:08,104
These men are yelling and screaming and
they're jumping up and falling down...

358
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:12,468
And there's, like, dust everywhere,
and nobody can see anything.

359
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:17,226
Like, I'm totally not ready to see
this [Bleep] that's happening around me.

360
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:20,347
And it makes me sick.

361
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:39,916
You know, I made some calls,
and Dale's story checked out.

362
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,870
The Spanish Flu devastated Cressona.

363
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:45,987
So, I'm headed over to see a local
Doctor who says some of those victims

364
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:51,028
may have died right in
Randy and Angela's home.

365
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:02,388
Before we get into the Spanish Flu,
can you tell me anything about Dr. Gray?

366
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:06,472
He was the only Doctor in
Cressona during the Spanish Flu.

367
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:10,805
And his clinic and his residence
were in the same building.

368
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,521
Okay, so did he practice out
of the house I'm investigating?

369
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,680
Yes.

370
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,349
Okay, so how bad really was it?

371
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,866
The Spanish Flu was about 200 times
as lethal as our typical flu virus.

372
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:26,471
50 million people died worldwide.

373
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,927
Wow.

374
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:30,596
That being said, how
bad did Cressona get hit?

375
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:34,148
Cressona was absolutely
hammered with death.

376
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:37,021
They normally had about
10 people die each day.

377
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,103
Okay.

378
00:23:38,104 --> 00:23:40,939
But it spiked around
the 20th of October.

379
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,498
There were 30 deaths
in a small community.

380
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:48,080
The Spanish Flu itself,
how contagious was it?

381
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:53,981
Nationally, 28% of the U.S. population
came down with the 1918 influenza.

382
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:57,132
And there were a great
number of people that died

383
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,968
four or five days after
coming down with the illness.

384
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,883
- Wow.
- Yeah.

385
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:04,764
So, the beginning symptoms,
what would they be like?

386
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:09,201
Well, initially, you'd develop a headache
and body aches and cold symptoms...

387
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,303
Runny nose, sore throat, coughing.

388
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,239
And how does it progress
to where they die?

389
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,377
Well, in most cases, fatalities
were from bacterial pneumonia.

390
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:18,645
Okay.

391
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:22,415
You would feel like your chest
was being compressed or squeezed.

392
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,885
It would be like starvation of air.

393
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:28,454
Oh, geez. So, basically,
they suffocated to death.

394
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:31,656
Yeah. It was absolutely scary.

395
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:33,906
Dr. Gray had to be
overwhelmed by all this.

396
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:38,674
Yes. They would've been convalescing
in his house and dying there.

397
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:40,535
Wow.

398
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:49,422
It's ridiculous how many
dead people are here.

399
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,833
Something happened.

400
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:01,074
What the [Bleep] is it?

401
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:07,718
There's, like, illness in here.

402
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,899
Oh, my God, it's bad.

403
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:15,767
The amount of dead in this location feels
like it's sucking the life out of me.

404
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:19,838
I've been sick this whole time,
but I can't figure out why.

405
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,999
Oh, God.

406
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:25,304
I can't breathe again.

407
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:28,768
I just want to vomit.

408
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,989
I feel...

409
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,796
[Bleep] Terrible.

410
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:44,697
During my walk, I was harassed
by a tall, thin man in a cape.

411
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:48,500
So I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to draw him as he appeared in life.

412
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,461
He had a long, thin, pointy nose.

413
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:58,915
His eyes are rounded on
top, straight at the bottom.

414
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,412
Okay.

415
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:05,093
His hair came down to
about the collarbone.

416
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:09,822
Next, I described his favorite
place to torment the living.

417
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:12,124
There's a closet along the wall.

418
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,951
It needs to be open halfway.

419
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,006
All right.

420
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:21,167
He's facing the side of
the bed from the closet.

421
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:29,575
Is that what you saw?

422
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,982
Yes.

423
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:58,573
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

424
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:04,474
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

425
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,797
Amy, I want you to
meet Angela and Randy.

426
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,553
They live here with Angela's
son and Randy's two daughters.

427
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:15,424
Now, the thing about this couple, unlike
any other couple we've dealt with...

428
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,728
They're both Army veterans.

429
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:21,103
And they've been trained to
deal with high-stress situations.

430
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:24,946
But the activity in
this house is so intense

431
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,528
that it's literally
ripping their family apart.

432
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:30,736
With that, I'm gonna ask Amy to
tell us a little bit about her walk.

433
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:34,457
And see what we come up with.

434
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:42,945
This is seriously one of the
worst places that I've walked.

435
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:46,141
There were just so
many dead people, and...

436
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:49,436
They were all trying to talk at once.

437
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:53,516
I was physically and
emotionally just trashed.

438
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:57,044
Pretty much every room
upstairs made me sick.

439
00:27:57,045 --> 00:28:01,131
Some of the symptoms I felt that
night was dizziness, vomiting...

440
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:05,286
Um, and I did, in one room, felt
like somebody was crushing my throat.

441
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,634
Okay, so you were sick
throughout the whole walk?

442
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,126
- Yes.
- With those symptoms?

443
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:10,907
- Yes.
- That's why you sound sick?

444
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:14,048
- Yeah. Mm hmm.
- From that? That's interesting.

445
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,341
I might be able to explain
why she probably felt that way.

446
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:20,820
Back in 1918, the Spanish Flu hit here.

447
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:24,973
30 people died in one day from
the Spanish Flu in Cressona.

448
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:28,951
Approximately 20% of the
town died from this flu.

449
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:32,046
James Gray, the guy that owned
this house and lived here,

450
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,533
happened to be the only Doctor in town.

451
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:37,939
And he treated a lot of those Spanish
Flu patients right here in this home,

452
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,638
where a lot of them
probably passed away.

453
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:42,299
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

454
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,355
Can the children get sick because of that
or us get sick because of that or anything?

455
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:48,236
Have you shown any symptoms?

456
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:51,373
I went through exactly what you
just described on many occasions.

457
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:55,106
It's like Steve had mentioned...
it's like a flu-like symptom.

458
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:58,176
But all of a sudden, I got
a debilitating headache.

459
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,440
I mean, I couldn't even walk.

460
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,430
I crawled to the bathroom

461
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,820
because I felt like I was gonna vomit,
and I was super, super nauseated.

462
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,889
- I couldn't even stand up.
- Yeah, I get sick a lot.

463
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,958
- Same type of feelings?
- Headaches, migraines.

464
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,175
Yeah, that makes sense.

465
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:14,474
The residual here is very thick.

466
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:17,715
Like, it hangs on to...

467
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,405
The memories and, you know...

468
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:25,126
Everything that transpired here.

469
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,568
So, how did the rest of the walk go?

470
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,663
This guy shows up.

471
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:39,544
He was extremely tall, extremely
thin, had a hat on, cape...

472
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,853
Shadowy.

473
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,816
He's very creepy, very powerful.

474
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,640
I met him when I walked through here.

475
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:53,834
And he's like, I'm gonna suck
the [Bleep] life out of you.

476
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,536
He doesn't want me to
get anything about him.

477
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,821
He's getting really mad.

478
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:01,002
He was a businessman.

479
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:03,896
I know he bought and sold things.

480
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:08,417
And I know he had a
hook nose and dark eyes.

481
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:10,546
- Really?
- Yeah.

482
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,062
Well, I mean, it's a long shot.

483
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:16,499
I mean, but what she's describing
kind of reminds me of somebody

484
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,583
who's kind of actually
pretty important to this town.

485
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:22,749
Okay, well, it turns out it's a guy named
John Chapman Cresson, hence Cressona.

486
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,080
This guy ran the rail road here, owned
the rail road, and bought the land here...

487
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:29,619
And basically built the town.

488
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,998
Now, he had some shady dealings.

489
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,123
He built homes for the rail
road workers that he employed.

490
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:40,059
Okay, now I got a photo of
some of these rail road workers.

491
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,099
It'll give you an idea of
what these guys looked like.

492
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,199
So, what he was doing is he built homes
like this one for his employees to live in.

493
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,079
So, what he did was
he paid them at work...

494
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,208
Then sold them the house,
and they just paid him rent,

495
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:59,137
so the money that he was
making went right back to him.

496
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:03,053
Come 1864, he leases his rail
road company out to Reading,

497
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:06,049
so now all his workers,
they were out of a job.

498
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,637
It basically decimated the town, where they
went into a recession for over 20 years.

499
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:11,310
- Wow.
- Wow.

500
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:14,791
If you look at his nose...

501
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,014
He's got this hook nose that she had.

502
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,100
Interesting.

503
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:25,001
And he was considered tall for
his time, from what I was told.

504
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:29,216
Do you think that they had the same
characteristics as the guy you ran into?

505
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:31,283
Definitely.

506
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:35,064
I did do a sketch of the man.

507
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,848
Wow.

508
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,084
Take a look at that.

509
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,345
Wow, his eyes are pretty close. His
eyes and nose are almost identical.

510
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:51,046
Identical, right?

511
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:53,796
Wow, that's freaky. I would
say that's the same guy.

512
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:55,405
It looks spot on to me.

513
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:59,579
So, basically, the guy that built
Cressona is hanging out in our house.

514
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,460
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

515
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:05,715
So, Amy, in your opinion...

516
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:11,616
Do you think this gentleman is
the evil presence in our house?

517
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:20,945
I think he's an evil
presence in your house.

518
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,594
He likes to mess with people.

519
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:29,554
One of the things that he did to me in
here was, like he was standing on my chest.

520
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:33,662
What I saw was him, like,
pushing down on someone's chest.

521
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:38,665
When I was in here, I felt,
like, your ear will thump.

522
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,239
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

523
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,560
And he'll try to whisper in your ear.

524
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,105
You'll feel pokes.

525
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:52,051
I get poked and my hair
pulled almost every night.

526
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:57,879
He gives people nightmares, and
he also likes to stare people down.

527
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,948
And I have tremendous nightmares.

528
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:05,089
- Really?
- I am sleeping upstairs...

529
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:07,949
And...

530
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,870
Um...

531
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:14,737
I get a set of hands that
come up through the bed.

532
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:17,047
Pull me all the way down,
and I can feel myself

533
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:19,404
going through the layers of the house.

534
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:25,305
And when I get to the basement, he
says, I've got you. I finally got you.

535
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:28,635
She sees a gremlin-type creature.

536
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:32,368
He could manipulate how he's perceived.

537
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:34,237
And it knows what scares you.

538
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:45,070
The other thing that I got was, uh...

539
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,891
He hates children.

540
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:49,850
He hates kids.

541
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:52,747
And then I saw one of
the things he was doing,

542
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:55,663
which I thought was very disturbing,
and I did sketch it, so...

543
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:57,622
- You sketched it?
- Yeah, I did.

544
00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:59,751
- Where did you see this?
- This.

545
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:03,412
Oh, so it's Samantha's room.

546
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:13,965
I don't even know if I
want to show this to you.

547
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,858
That's the closet.

548
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,312
I want this guy.

549
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:40,526
I'm gonna get this guy.

550
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:19,061
I want this guy.

551
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:24,892
I'm gonna get this guy.

552
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,494
I'm confronting this little bastard.

553
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:47,603
That John Cresson [Bleep] him and
I are gonna have some dealings.

554
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,944
I'm gonna sit down, and I'm gonna square
off with that son of a [Bleep] on his own.

555
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:56,225
He wants a piece of
something, come and [Bleep] me.

556
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,223
- You all right?
- Yep.

557
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:09,253
I know a few people
that won't be, though.

558
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,255
Problem is you're not
dealing with the living here.

559
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,990
I know.

560
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,526
Samantha is deathly
afraid of the closets.

561
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:19,434
Because of that, she had me draw
crosses on every one of her walls.

562
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:23,414
And a huge three-foot cross
on the one closet door.

563
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,969
Wow.

564
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,937
Do you have any idea
why he doesn't like kids?

565
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,606
He's just a jerk.

566
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:31,308
And he's just a coward.

567
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:32,755
Very much so.

568
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:36,176
A sick, sick, sick coward.

569
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:41,885
I hate to even ask this right now,
but was there anything else you saw?

570
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,910
I saw an old lady.

571
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:49,559
And I got that she might have been
a relative of someone who lives here.

572
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,195
That she died of cancer, and
she died in the late '90s.

573
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:54,396
Oh!

574
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:56,797
Oh, my God.

575
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:59,768
Her mother died of cancer.

576
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:03,129
I told you she was here.

577
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:09,311
If it's Angela's Mom,
why would she be here?

578
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,491
She had a lot of
regret. She felt guilty.

579
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:18,392
And she kept saying that she felt
responsible about everything that happened.

580
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:20,401
She...

581
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:23,125
Knew that there was a bad male.

582
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:27,830
She felt like she could've stopped
it from happening, but she didn't.

583
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:31,041
My stepfather was a very evil man.

584
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:35,377
And towards the end, before she
died, I tried to make amends,

585
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:41,036
and he would not let me speak to
her on the phone or come and see her.

586
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:44,517
And she died a week later.

587
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,970
She's back to take
the woman of the house.

588
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:50,903
Death was gonna come to the
house, but she came instead.

589
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,824
Whoa.

590
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,961
When I was leaving, she said, my
job's done. Tell her I'm waiting.

591
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:00,729
What?

592
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,266
Somebody's coming to kill her?

593
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,067
No.

594
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,872
But someone's coming to
take her when she dies.

595
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,793
Okay.

596
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:16,512
I mean, for her to take death's
place so that she'll be comfortable.

597
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:20,413
- So, it's out of love.
- Yeah.

598
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:24,316
Is her mother really feeling guilty?

599
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,730
Yes.

600
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:27,990
And you feel guilty, as well.

601
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,526
Why do you feel guilty?

602
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,224
Because I didn't say goodbye.

603
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:36,633
I didn't get to say that I forgive her.

604
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:40,774
I knew she'd be there when I died.

605
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,556
Well, listen, it's been a tough night.

606
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,949
And I think you guys got a lot
more than you bargained for.

607
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,489
- For sure.
- Definitely.

608
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,485
But the reason we're here and why
you called us is to see if you...

609
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,363
And your family can live here peacefully

610
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,372
and straighten out what
the hell you got going on.

611
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:01,157
Yes.

612
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:02,466
I can't answer that,

613
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:07,924
but I'm gonna turn it over to my
partner, Amy, and hopefully, she can.

614
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:12,593
Me, personally, I don't
like this house or this area.

615
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:17,073
If it's at all within
your means, I would move.

616
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,833
I won't let it beat us.

617
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,911
If we made it this far, we went through
everything we went through so far,

618
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:25,158
I'm not gonna just roll over and say go
ahead and take it I'm fighting for what's

619
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,399
mine this is our house this is where our
children are gonna grow up this is where

620
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,176
we're gonna be safe whether they like
it or not they're getting the hell out.

621
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:35,642
You know, monetarily, they can't leave.

622
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:38,297
It would devastate them, so is
there anything else they can do?

623
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:40,638
Basically...

624
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,472
Because it seems to be
encompassing the town,

625
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:47,247
like, you need to build your fortress.

626
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:52,254
So, the first thing being
for you to get bags of salt.

627
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:56,755
And go around the
entire property line...

628
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:00,684
Thick so you see the line on the ground.

629
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:04,385
When you can do it, I would suggest,

630
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:07,932
building a fence surrounding
the entire property.

631
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:12,089
And when you purchase
those building materials.

632
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,097
Have them blessed.

633
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:16,466
- Wow.
- So, who should do the blessing?

634
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,807
Any real...

635
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:20,401
Holy person.

636
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:24,134
Then, with a holy person,
again, of your choice.

637
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,544
They're gonna bless the house.

638
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:29,443
While this person's
blessing the house...

639
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:32,924
I want you to take this...

640
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:36,180
Follow them around, and after
they're done in each room...

641
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:40,111
Blessing each room...
sprinkle this in the room.

642
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:41,271
What is this?

643
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,902
This is brimstone.

644
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:46,397
And it's used in exorcisms.

645
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,055
Oh, my God.

646
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:49,545
And what will that do?

647
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,663
It'll get rid of the dead people here.

648
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:54,453
- What about her Mom?
- That woman will stay.

649
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,393
That process cannot stop.

650
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:58,359
It's natural, organic.

651
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,739
I'm mortified.

652
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,860
I thought there was...

653
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:07,686
Maybe four things here
and one of them was evil.

654
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:10,805
But not to this extent.

655
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,452
- Okay.
- We're gonna be fine.

656
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:15,554
I'm not gonna let nothing
happen to the kids.

657
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:17,894
Now, I'm gonna ask you, are
you gonna follow Amy's advice?

658
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,059
- Without a doubt.
- Angela?

659
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,269
Yeah.

660
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,687
This is one of those investigations, I got
to tell you, especially because I'm a vet.

661
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:30,436
The fact that we were able to hopefully
help you here makes me feel good.

662
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:32,200
I know it makes her feel good.

663
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,743
But from the bottom of my heart, I
really appreciate it from both of you.

664
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,773
- Well, thank you for letting us come in.
- Mm hmm.

665
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:41,834
Thank you for coming.

666
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,939
I still believe Angela and
Randy would be best off moving.

667
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,777
But since they can't, I really
hope that they follow my advice.

668
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:55,678
So that their home can be freed of the
dead and their kids will remain safe.
