1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:13,403
You got some crazy going on here.

3
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,739
I heard a man say,
I'm going to kill you.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,975
Scared. A lot of fear.

5
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,277
I see a shadow.

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,077
I see a man go down the hallway.

7
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:26,146
Jumping all over the room.

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:28,749
Someone took a hot curling
iron to the back of my neck.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,682
Sounds like you have a serious problem.

10
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,449
I just got grabbed.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,690
Somebody died back here.

12
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,894
It's really bad in here.

13
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,926
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,673
Something is not right.

15
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:44,960
I see dead people.

16
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,115
This person might have
been a serial killer.

17
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:49,149
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,683
You get those chills.

19
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,352
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,620
He is darkness. He is evil.

21
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,622
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:59,491
I think she broke her neck.

23
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,046
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:04,794
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

25
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:06,462
You telling me the truth?

26
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:09,548
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,233
I think the Devil is down here.

28
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,702
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,330
Who the hell would do this?

30
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,323
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,476
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,046
Until the very end.

33
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,193
Who's he looking to kill?

34
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,295
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,373
You need to get out of here right now.

36
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,612
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:30,213
It was like endless darkness.

38
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,744
Amy and I look into
each case separately.

39
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,155
I interview living
witnesses and uncover dark

40
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:56,820
history that's been
buried and forgotten.

41
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:00,715
While Amy communicates with the dead.

42
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,963
I've just arrived in St.
Clair Shores, Michigan.

43
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,849
It's about a half-hour
outside of Detroit.

44
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,186
I received a call from a mom named Emily,
and she sounded pretty upset on the phone.

45
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:14,228
Her husband and two sets of twins are
being tormented by paranormal activity.

46
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:20,129
She says it's ripping the whole
family apart, and we're her last hope.

47
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:30,231
Before Amy arrives, I do a
complete sweep of the house.

48
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:33,376
Things that are common in most
homes, like family photographs,

49
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,797
can influence her findings.

50
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:42,823
So it's important I remove them
all before she begins her walk.

51
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,669
This is not good.

52
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,022
What?

53
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,393
There was, like, a man...

54
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,994
Crawling out from under here.

55
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:20,424
And he doesn't have any
arms or legs anymore.

56
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:25,285
So he's, like, a black
slithery, snaky thing.

57
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,559
He makes you feel...

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,480
Fear.

59
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,873
So, Emily, when we spoke
on the phone, you sounded

60
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,081
pretty upset about the things
that are happening here.

61
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,738
- Yes.
- Tell me what's going on.

62
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,716
We hear voices, footsteps.

63
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:57,557
We see shadows move, apparitions.

64
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,154
Okay. How many people
actually live in the house?

65
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:05,607
My husband, my 12-year-old
twins, my 7-year-old twins.

66
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,993
And we have two dogs.

67
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,079
Okay. How long are you living here?

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,177
- Seven and a half years.
- Why did you call us now?

69
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,671
In the last year, it's gotten physical.

70
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,335
- Really?
- Mm hmm. I've been scratched.

71
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:20,241
I have severe nausea every day.

72
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:26,142
And my youngest son has also
been showing symptoms of nausea.

73
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,439
Feeling sick to your stomach is
hardly proof of something paranormal.

74
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,536
But it's not my job to speculate
about that side of the case.

75
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,871
I leave that up to Amy.

76
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:37,040
Have you and him gone to a doctor?

77
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:41,488
Yes. But no one can
explain why it's happening.

78
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,614
Well, that's got to be tearing you and
your husband apart a little bit, right?

79
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,925
It is. Me and my husband
don't sleep together anymore.

80
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,670
I sleep up here on the couch.

81
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,126
Why?

82
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,621
To stay closer to my children.

83
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:56,467
I couldn't leave them up
here by themselves anymore.

84
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:59,947
I'm very worried that
they're going to be hurt.

85
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,868
Okay.

86
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:12,616
You got some crazy going on here.

87
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,029
And now I feel really sick.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,431
I don't feel good at all.

89
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,088
What's going on?

90
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,209
It's a stomach thing.

91
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:32,543
[Bleep] I don't feel good in this place.

92
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,644
At all.

93
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,265
Phew.

94
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,941
- Like, mm.
- Just, your stomach in general?

95
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,703
It's like stomach and heart.

96
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:45,884
Terrible. Terrible pain.

97
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,327
Mm.

98
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,455
Okay, so, what's going on in this room?

99
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,080
I hear voices all night.

100
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:06,372
One night, I heard a man
say, I'm going to kill you.

101
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:10,314
- That had to scare the hell out of you.
- Mm hmm.

102
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:15,672
My daughter Katey came running out
of her room the other day, screaming.

103
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,423
Um, completely naked.

104
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:20,641
And she said a man whistled and...

105
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,330
Breathed heavy in her ear.

106
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,664
- It was heartbreaking.
- Wow. Anything else?

107
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,734
I see an apparition of an older man.

108
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:33,142
I would say he's probably in his 70s.

109
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,505
He wears a hat.

110
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:38,043
- It does have a brim on it.
- Okay.

111
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,576
Now, besides that guy,
have you seen anything else?

112
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:44,742
The first night that we
moved in, I saw a uh...

113
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:48,403
Huge, big, cloudy, black mass.

114
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,955
Hanging right over here.

115
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:52,608
I screamed.

116
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:55,541
And that's when it went away.

117
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,294
How often have you seen that?

118
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:02,252
It happened for seven straight
days the first week we moved in.

119
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,173
Okay.

120
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:11,642
I'm seeing this one guy
from outside under the car.

121
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,343
He's everywhere.

122
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:20,695
Plus, you've got some
weird [Bleep] on the wall.

123
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:24,281
- What do you mean?
- It's like, um, lines.

124
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,642
Squiggly lines, like this.

125
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,354
- That's what's on the wall?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:38,255
They're, like, more of an emotional
kind of a thing. Like an unsettled...

127
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,698
Feeling.

128
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,168
It might be coming from
someone who is still alive.

129
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,946
Sometimes when the living
experience intense negative emotions,

130
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:55,864
their energy can manifest things
like these bizarre lines on the walls.

131
00:07:55,865 --> 00:08:00,507
And they have the ability to
affect the living in harmful ways.

132
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:06,268
It kind of gives me a headache
and makes me feel chaotic.

133
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:09,972
Whatever it is, is not good.

134
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,757
Okay, so, what's going on down here?

135
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,416
I've had my hair pulled from the back...

136
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,223
Very violently.

137
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:27,147
And there wasn't the
kids around or anything

138
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:28,977
like that that could've
possibly done that?

139
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,283
Nobody was down here. I was alone.

140
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,218
It sounds like you have
a serious problem here.

141
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,784
It's actually even worse than that.

142
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,545
I've been burnt.

143
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,895
It was like someone took a hot
curling iron to the back of my neck.

144
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,676
It happened four times.

145
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:49,697
Every time, I was taking a shower.

146
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,218
Wow.

147
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,544
You sure it wasn't
maybe the heat changing?

148
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:04,425
Absolutely positive.

149
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,333
Geez.

150
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,552
Now, what if Amy says this is only
going to get worse and you can't fix it?

151
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:11,533
What would you do?

152
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:15,217
I'm going to take my kids
and walk out that door.

153
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,138
Okay.

154
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:23,833
I just felt like
somebody touched my hair.

155
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:26,517
Like, there has been some
physical [Bleep] here.

156
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:29,294
Ah. I just got grabbed.

157
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:32,603
Like, behind my... right here.

158
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:34,382
Like that.

159
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:35,799
Okay.

160
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,752
And he said, basically,
get out of here [Bleep]!

161
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:42,460
Shut up.

162
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,971
And one would think
that it's a dead male.

163
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:51,892
But it is a fully-formed
uh, PK manifestation.

164
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:58,190
A PK manifestation usually happens when a
living person's energy creates an entity.

165
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:04,091
These manifestations are very powerful and
can physically influence their environment.

166
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,801
How advanced would you say it is?

167
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:13,382
Well, it's definitely capable
of causing physical injury.

168
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,303
Erich, I spoke to Emily.

169
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,905
Um, she told me about all the
stuff that's happening here.

170
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,973
What have you been experiencing?

171
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:46,786
I came down to take a nap one afternoon.

172
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:50,443
And I thought it was Katey and Erich
that came down and actually were...

173
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:53,082
Bouncing on the bed
and talking and whatnot.

174
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,923
- So you were sleeping on the bed.
- Correct.

175
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,733
And what, did you feel
like this, how did it?

176
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:58,359
Yeah, pretty much.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,524
Kind of felt like two
kids jumping on a bed.

178
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,314
Okay.

179
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:05,228
But when I went to
look, they weren't there.

180
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,616
Have you seen anything?

181
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:09,602
Oh, I see apparitions
down here frequently.

182
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,206
- Frequently.
- Describe the apparitions for me.

183
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,707
There's a guy.

184
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:18,693
And he will walk behind me
and come into this bedroom.

185
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:21,083
It's pretty unnerving.

186
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:23,209
It's got to be tough on your family.

187
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,006
Sometimes, you got your kids and
they look at you and they wonder um...

188
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:29,916
Why did you do this to me?

189
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:35,817
- Well, that's got to break your heart.
- Oh, it hurts. It hurts.

190
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,802
There's just problems within the family.

191
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:51,241
And unfortunately, this family has
some emotional instability there.

192
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:55,802
There's definitely a
poltergeist going on.

193
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:59,497
Um, there might be a few...

194
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,764
Happening.

195
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:05,244
Do you know if they're aware
that they're doing this?

196
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:08,222
No. No, I don't think so.

197
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:12,981
You also have kids who
are... have abilities.

198
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:18,211
And they happen to be able
to create PK manifestations.

199
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:23,852
And there's so much energy,
it literally makes you sick.

200
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,383
So, I was talking to mom.

201
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:38,050
And your mom said
that you guys have been

202
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,844
having some strange
experiences in the house.

203
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,394
- Is that right?
- Yes.

204
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,986
Okay, so, Erich, why don't you
tell me what you've been seeing?

205
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:49,774
Sometimes, I see a
shadow in the hallway.

206
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,689
Okay. What kind of shadow
are we talking about?

207
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,165
Like, a man.

208
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,724
Was anybody walking around
that they made that shadow?

209
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,476
Or was it something,
I don't know, where...

210
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,286
- No one was there.
- Nobody was there.

211
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,082
- No.
- Okay. What about you, Sweetie?

212
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:06,169
When I go to bed, I always
see a man go down the hallway.

213
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,486
Is it the same like he sees it?

214
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,769
Okay. What else have you experienced?

215
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,069
Well, we both seen a girl.

216
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,194
- A little girl?
- Yes.

217
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,786
Okay. Do you know how she's dressed?

218
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:21,622
Sometimes, she has a big white dress on.

219
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:24,653
And it sleeps with me sometimes.

220
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:28,439
She just sleeps at the end of
there, and my head's back there.

221
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,038
- Okay. Does that scare you?
- Mm.

222
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,748
So, you've had a lot of things
happening in your room here.

223
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:36,419
Do you have trouble going to
bed at night because of that?

224
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,296
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes.

225
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,397
Me too.

226
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,220
There's a lot of
emotional instability here.

227
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:52,797
And people are...

228
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,558
And people are...

229
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,293
Freaking out and...

230
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,654
Crying and hiding under...

231
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,788
Blankets and sheets.

232
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,639
Like, how many people?
Can you talk about them?

233
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,286
I would say there is four
people who are very freaked out.

234
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,168
Okay.

235
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:18,847
I'd say at least three of them have...

236
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,044
- Some PK [Bleep] going on.
- Okay.

237
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:25,965
I think it's really just
mainly a poltergeist.

238
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,808
Chad, I was talking your mom.

239
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,178
And she told me that she's
having trouble sleeping at night.

240
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:38,998
Mm-hmm.

241
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,900
Are you having any
problems sleeping at night?

242
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,786
Sometimes, when I go to
bed, like, I hear voices.

243
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,500
What kind of voices are you hearing?

244
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,246
Like, "hey". And like coughs.

245
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,262
What else are you seeing?

246
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,723
One time, I came in
from playing basketball.

247
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,250
And I was going to get
some water. I grabbed a cup.

248
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,044
And, like, the faucet
just, like, turned on.

249
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:01,194
- On its own?
- Mm hmm. Like, full-force on.

250
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:03,423
So when that happened,
did that scare you at all?

251
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:04,993
No, not really.

252
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,219
Let me ask you a question. Does
anything in the house scare you?

253
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,152
Um, usually, in the basement,
I see a shadow in my dad's room.

254
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,484
Like, it's a tall man in a hat.

255
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:15,294
Okay.

256
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:18,568
And just, like, peeks around
the corner and just goes away.

257
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,147
You act kind of cool about all
the stuff that's happening here.

258
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:25,642
You don't seem to be, I don't think you're
dealing with it about it the right way.

259
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:28,960
It's not normal for a 12-year-old not
to be able to go to sleep at night.

260
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,903
It's okay to be afraid.

261
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:36,155
It's okay to be upset or
scared about something.

262
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,330
You all right?

263
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,251
Okay.

264
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,871
Mm.

265
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,118
A lot of different emotions.

266
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,735
Like, definitely wanting to
cry, though, is the biggest one.

267
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,253
Where are they coming from?

268
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:59,171
The kid that's in this room.

269
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,975
The person in here hears voices.

270
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:06,596
People talking in the
room from the walls.

271
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,820
Causes, like, headaches.
It's, like, too much.

272
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,468
What's causing headaches?

273
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:20,029
The voices and the
noise and the buzzing.

274
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:26,102
This room is like [Bleep] chaos.

275
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:43,167
This room is like [Bleep] chaos.

276
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:48,235
There's, like, nightmares
and screaming and crying.

277
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:51,922
And then, there's
these, like, light rods.

278
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:55,763
Like, jumping all over the room.

279
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,959
And it's so much, it hurts. It hurts.

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,220
It buzzes in your head. It's buzzing.

281
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:09,358
The energy in this
room is very unstable.

282
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,135
Whoever lives here has major abilities
but doesn't know how to control them.

283
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:18,336
Definitely, like, PK energy, for sure.

284
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,556
Just not good.

285
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,182
I usually start my investigation by

286
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:29,279
reaching out to the
property's former owners.

287
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,113
Most times, it's a dead end.

288
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,344
In this case, I found
a woman named Shannon.

289
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,215
She says she's got some information
that will definitely help my case.

290
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:44,116
She's agreed to meet me at the
house and tell me what happened.

291
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:51,121
Shannon, let me ask you a question. When
was the last time you were in this house?

292
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,338
I'm guessing the late '70s.

293
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,712
- Okay. So you grew up here.
- Yes.

294
00:17:55,713 --> 00:18:00,461
During your time here did you ever
experience anything you couldn't explain?

295
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,689
- No. Mm mm.
- Nothing?

296
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,500
Now, you mentioned on
the phone that you had

297
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,395
some information that
could help my case.

298
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:09,784
Well, my grandfather passed
away here in the house.

299
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:10,822
Ah, geez.

300
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,119
Just of natural causes.

301
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,996
Did anybody else die in
the house that you know of?

302
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:21,277
Ah, yes. Actually, my other
grandfather's girlfriend.

303
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,098
What year did this happen?

304
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,939
1978.

305
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,601
In fact, here's the article
out of the local paper.

306
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:33,990
There was a coat rack next to
the stairway to the basement.

307
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,032
Okay.

308
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,253
And um...

309
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:42,336
Georgina went towards the coat rack and

310
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:46,116
probably didn't realize the
stairway was beneath her feet.

311
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:49,494
- Okay.
- So, she fell down the stairs and...

312
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,795
Um, she tragically, um...

313
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:55,772
Passed away that day.

314
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:57,484
How'd your grandfather take that?

315
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:02,045
It's the first time I ever seen him cry.

316
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:07,328
I haven't thought about it in years.

317
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:12,627
Somebody died back here.

318
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:16,861
- What happened?
- It was just, like...

319
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:19,682
It was very fast.

320
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:24,506
Like, everybody involved with it is...

321
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,545
Completely confused.

322
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,167
Um...

323
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:36,451
Scared. A lot of fear from these
people concerning this person.

324
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:42,235
And it's, like, a sudden...
man, it's like, bam!

325
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,715
I'm, like, very confused right now.

326
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:48,296
Like... like...

327
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:51,570
Here's the pain again. The pain again.

328
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,295
- Like, the grabbing?
- Yes.

329
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:57,356
Hurts so [Bleep] bad.

330
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,813
I'm at the local library to see what

331
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:04,688
else I can uncover about
my client's property.

332
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,299
While digging through old deeds,

333
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,120
I discovered that a man named Noah
Furton originally owned the land.

334
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:17,021
But what catches my attention is a tragedy
involving two of his young children.

335
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,151
So I've reached out to
one of his descendants,

336
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:24,832
who says there's a
lot more to his story.

337
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:32,568
So, Bev, it turns out that Noah
Furton actually owned the property that

338
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,632
I'm investigating and lived there.
But you're a descendant of his.

339
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,132
- How are you related?
- He was my great-grandfather.

340
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,626
What can you tell me about him?

341
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:43,585
Well, he was a sea Captain on
the Great Lakes for 35 years.

342
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:47,306
I have a picture of his boat.

343
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,780
Now, I saw in the census
that he lost two sons.

344
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,664
Yes. He lost two children.

345
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,813
One was two, and one was two months old.

346
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:59,587
And they died within a week
of each other of measles.

347
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:01,622
He also lost his wife.

348
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,791
- What did she die of?
- Tuberculosis.

349
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,835
- She was 49.
- So she was young.

350
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:06,747
Yes.

351
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,809
So, what ever wound
up happening with him?

352
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,070
Well, when he was 78, he passed away.

353
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,392
It sounds like he had
a pretty tough life.

354
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:21,410
Yes, he did. But he also had a cousin,
Adolphus, who also lived on the property.

355
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:23,145
And he had a very tough life.

356
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,601
- You know anything about it?
- No, I don't know much.

357
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:27,522
Okay.

358
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:32,837
The men here have problems.

359
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,753
You're talking about the dead?

360
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:40,150
Yeah. Dead and living men
have problems in this location.

361
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:44,531
Like, they don't act like their selves.

362
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:53,166
So a normal guy moves in and then he...

363
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:57,060
Gets involved with bad [Bleep] or...

364
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,932
Drops dead or goes crazy.

365
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:03,112
But it doesn't have anything
to do with the PK phenomena.

366
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,305
Is this anything that
might be dangerous?

367
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:08,226
Yeah.

368
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:24,084
Bev mentioned that
Noah's cousin had an even

369
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:26,486
worse time on the
property I'm investigating.

370
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,873
So I'm headed over to
meet with a local archivist

371
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:34,774
who tells me that the tragedy
this man suffered was unthinkable.

372
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:42,240
Cindy, you mentioned that this guy,
Adolphus, had a pretty tragic life.

373
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,349
But before we even get into that,
what can you tell me about him?

374
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,160
Adolphus comes from a long line of
French-Canadians who settled in this area.

375
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,402
Okay.

376
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:56,567
And the Furton family did live on the
property that you are investigating.

377
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:59,898
Okay. And then they settled
here to do what kind of work?

378
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,353
He started out, as a
young man farming and,

379
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:07,139
eventually went to the
occupation of sailing.

380
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,412
Either for commercial vessels, small
boats, or the larger company boats.

381
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:15,071
Okay. So they were considered,
like, merchant seamen at the time.

382
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:18,956
I know that's dangerous work today.
So how bad was it for them back then?

383
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:21,829
There were a lot of boiler explosions.

384
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,307
There were a lot of groundings
of ships on the flats.

385
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:29,428
It was very dangerous.

386
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:36,444
This black, like...

387
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:40,294
Slithery, snaky thing.

388
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:46,606
I'm trying to figure out what
he looked like when he was alive.

389
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:48,000
He's a big guy.

390
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:51,259
He's got, like, longer brown hair.

391
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,000
Has an accent and/or
spoke another language.

392
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,759
I think he's scared.

393
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,580
And there's a lot of violence
around him and in his life.

394
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,940
Now, Cindy, was Adolphus married?

395
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:14,823
Yes, he was. His first wife, Mary, was
married to him the 29th of January of 1886.

396
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,935
And they had seven children together.

397
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:20,343
Okay. Now you mentioned he had
unthinkable tragedy in his life.

398
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:21,202
What was it?

399
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:25,515
All of the children died as infants,
except for his daughter Julia.

400
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:29,339
She died as a teenager from
consumption at the age of 17.

401
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,223
But all the babies died.

402
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:34,259
Oh. So, what were the
reasons for their death?

403
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,636
Childhood diseases that we
didn't have any medicines for.

404
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:40,866
Typhoid, diphtheria, cholera, measles.

405
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,703
Wow. So, he buried all of his kids.

406
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:46,344
That's correct.

407
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,109
During my opening, I saw a graveyard.

408
00:24:57,283 --> 00:25:01,911
So I go to go in, and I notice that
I have to, like, really crouch down

409
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:05,301
and walk through the opening
because it was super short.

410
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:09,117
When I was going through
it, my thought was...

411
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:11,898
That it was something that
was built for children.

412
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:17,799
And I hear a voice say, "it was
awful. It took so many of them".

413
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:23,110
So now, married this woman. Married,
they had seven kids. All seven kids died.

414
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:26,215
You said it was his first wife,
though. What happened with Mary?

415
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:29,449
Mary passed away in 1898 of consumption.

416
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,994
And here is her death certificate.

417
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:33,786
Consumption is Tuberculosis, right?

418
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:37,147
- That's correct.
- Okay.

419
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:42,261
In 1901, he remarried a relative
of Mary's named Elizabeth.

420
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,868
Okay. Now, did they have kids together?

421
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:46,498
No, unfortunately, they
didn't have children together.

422
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,339
She also died shortly thereafter.

423
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:54,540
Now, with all this tragedy in his life,
what wound up happening with Adolphus?

424
00:25:54,541 --> 00:26:00,361
Adolphus, on November 21st,
1916, drowned in Lake St. Clair.

425
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:05,785
He was lost on the ice, and his body
was not found until the following spring.

426
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:08,258
- Okay.
- And they ruled it accidental?

427
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,607
Yes.

428
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,671
And how old was he when he died?

429
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,413
He was 55 years old.

430
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:17,964
This guy lived a pretty tragic
life for a man only 55 years old.

431
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:21,145
And a very tragic end.

432
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,963
I'm having a sketch artist
draw the two entities

433
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:34,683
who stood out the most from my walk.

434
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:36,949
First, the dark, slithering man.

435
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,430
He doesn't have...

436
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,487
Like, any legs.

437
00:26:41,488 --> 00:26:45,868
He still has, like, his head and torso.

438
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:50,145
And he's wrapped in a black mist.

439
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:55,634
Next, I described the bizarre
scene I saw in one of the bedrooms.

440
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:57,553
There's a child.

441
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:00,614
Sitting, cross-legged.

442
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:03,937
So, what he's looking at is...

443
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:06,473
These rod-shaped...

444
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:08,934
White lights.

445
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:12,023
That are moving across his room.

446
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,944
Okay.

447
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:24,126
Yes. That's what I saw.

448
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:48,050
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

449
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:53,951
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

450
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,998
This is Erich and Emily.

451
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:00,067
They live in this home with
their two sets of twins.

452
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:04,974
Things have gotten so bad in this house
that it's basically ripping them all apart.

453
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,531
It's at the point where
it got very physical,

454
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,599
and it looks like it's
directed more towards Emily.

455
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,410
But the concern is that it's going
to affect their children soon.

456
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,777
What they want to know is if they can
actually live here in a safe manner.

457
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,225
Now that Amy understands a
little bit about what's going on,

458
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:23,606
she's going to tell us about her walk.

459
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:29,768
In my opening, I did see
something that really stood out,

460
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:32,824
and it was a little disturbing to me.

461
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:36,161
There was a graveyard that
was built for children.

462
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:41,611
Then, I heard someone say that
there was a terrible accident.

463
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:44,020
And that many of them had died.

464
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,908
- So you saw a lot of dead kids?
- Yes.

465
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:51,575
Well, your house is not that old, but
the property goes back into the 1800s.

466
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:55,105
And the original owner of your
property was a guy named Noah Furton.

467
00:28:55,106 --> 00:29:01,006
And he had lost, back in 1891,
two sons to measles within a week.

468
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:05,027
One was two years old.
One was two months old.

469
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:08,912
What's worse is he had a cousin
named Adolphus that lived with him.

470
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,867
All of Adolphus' seven kids died young.

471
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:16,872
Six of them died under the age of
one, and one died at the age of 17.

472
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:18,733
Wow.

473
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,000
It's like a curse.

474
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:31,077
The next thing that I got was that
this property is not good for men.

475
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:38,051
Whatever is here on this property,
can cause them to kind of go crazy.

476
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:41,194
Or even to drop dead.

477
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,421
It absolutely has killed in the past.

478
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:50,322
And it's, to me, very dangerous.

479
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,567
It's interesting you say that
it's bad for men because...

480
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:56,435
Well, this guy, Noah, that lost
two his children, right, to measles.

481
00:29:56,436 --> 00:30:00,336
Now, his wife died at 49 of TB.

482
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:04,224
So he lost two kids and lost his wife.

483
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:06,223
And next, we talk about Adolphus.

484
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:10,238
Loses seven kids and then
two wives on top of that.

485
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,827
Lost his first wife
at 29 to Tuberculosis.

486
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:19,482
Remarries and loses his second wife
within a year or two after he got married.

487
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,838
So he never even had children with her.

488
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,464
Not only that, he wound up dying
under strange circumstances.

489
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:29,635
Even though Adolphus was
an experienced sailor,

490
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:33,099
he ends up drowning in Lake St. Clair.

491
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,844
Here's his death certificate.

492
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:38,022
They ruled it accidental drowning.

493
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:41,263
But who the hell knows?

494
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:47,639
The next thing that I
encountered was a dead person.

495
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:52,194
And I see him come out from...

496
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:55,075
Underneath the car.

497
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,845
He doesn't have any
arms or legs anymore,

498
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:02,766
so he's, like, a black,
slithery, snaky thing.

499
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,085
I felt like he lived here before.

500
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:11,342
The fear that I felt was really
overwhelming and powerful.

501
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:15,779
You know, when you get that really
tight sensation in your stomach?

502
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,689
And you almost feel like
you're going to pass out?

503
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,640
Yeah, that's kind of how I felt.

504
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,575
Have you seen this person?

505
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:30,032
I don't know if they're the same
person, but I see a man in a hat.

506
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,204
Is he intimidating to you?

507
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,101
He's scary.

508
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:37,462
- Okay.
- He just stares.

509
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:42,223
I did do a sketch of the man that I saw.

510
00:31:42,224 --> 00:31:46,664
The way he moved for me was snake-like.

511
00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:51,598
Whoa.

512
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,763
Mm.

513
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:09,253
Is there any chance that this guy
here could be one of the Furtons?

514
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,774
Very possible.

515
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:19,830
So, walking into the
house, it was chaos.

516
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:24,702
Very, very physically painful,
and it was just overwhelming.

517
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:28,360
What I finally figured
is that there's three main

518
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:31,740
experiences that you
guys would encounter.

519
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,701
The first thing is physical abuse.

520
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:39,668
And this seemed to
be directed towards...

521
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,649
Women.

522
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:46,737
I got grabbed by the back of my
neck, like, right under the ears.

523
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:49,596
And I could feel the
whole hand. Male's hand.

524
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:52,897
Very strong. Grabbing me.

525
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:56,269
It really hurt. A lot.

526
00:32:56,645 --> 00:33:00,290
Um, I've had my hair pulled.

527
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,691
Three times.

528
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:06,632
Tell her what happens
when you take a shower.

529
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:09,128
- It's like a burn.
- Okay.

530
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:11,626
And it's happened four times.

531
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:14,314
All four times, I was in the shower.

532
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:17,615
I actually have a photo.

533
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:22,635
Whoa! Okay. Wow.

534
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:30,251
I mean, I'm overwhelmed with all of
the things that are going on here.

535
00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:34,811
So you said people here are being
affected by three different things.

536
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:35,985
What else?

537
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:38,869
I pretty much had a constant headache.

538
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,550
Um, and nausea, feeling
sick to my stomach.

539
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:49,505
I also felt that my heart hurt.

540
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,851
You seem pretty upset
by what she's saying.

541
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:59,772
I had a heart attack
last year for no reason.

542
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:06,924
When we spoke, you didn't mention it.
Are you uncomfortable talking about it?

543
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,843
Yeah. It's scary.

544
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:11,927
I'm 38 years old. It's
not supposed to happen.

545
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:14,124
- Right.
- What happened?

546
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,766
The doctors can't explain it.

547
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:19,436
She's been through more tests than
any other person I know in my life.

548
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:23,679
And every day, I have
horrible, horrible headaches.

549
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,544
- How do you sleep at night?
- I don't sleep much at night.

550
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:29,213
Tell her where you sleep, so
you can be close to the kids.

551
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:31,924
- I sleep on the couch.
- Uh huh.

552
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:35,977
It's difficult, you know. You want
to have your significant other laying

553
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:40,318
next to you, and not
upstairs, away from you.

554
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:43,510
So, now you said there's three things
they're dealing with in this house.

555
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:47,096
Physical abuse. Sickness.
And what was the third thing?

556
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:50,877
The other thing was the voices.

557
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:56,428
When I got into the kids' room,
it was crazy out of control.

558
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,931
In that particular room, these
voices were not coming from the dead.

559
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,772
They were coming from the walls.

560
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,268
Yeah. We all hear it every day.

561
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:09,645
You guys are validated for
what you're going through here.

562
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:14,626
Definitely. More than I
could have ever thought.

563
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:24,510
So, there was another sketch that I did.

564
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:28,500
In the kids' room, where the
voices were coming from the walls...

565
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,821
I saw something else that disturbed me.

566
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,980
Have either one of you ever
seen anything like that?

567
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:54,801
We both see them.

568
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:58,816
I call them strings of light.

569
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:00,498
Where are they coming from?

570
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:06,399
This is one of the things that
happen in poltergeist hauntings.

571
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:10,424
And it's been going on for a while.

572
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:16,185
So it has developed into a
full-blown poltergeist haunting.

573
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:22,981
So, these strings of light that
we see, that's a poltergeist?

574
00:36:44,142 --> 00:36:49,782
This has developed into a
full-blown poltergeist haunting.

575
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:57,182
So, these strings of light that
we see, that's a poltergeist?

576
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,350
And it was created by living agents.

577
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:09,636
I almost feel like it's my fault.

578
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:16,642
Well, you both seem to have abilities...

579
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,490
That have spontaneously been activated.

580
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:29,110
You had this heart attack, which basically
was kind of a near-death situation.

581
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:33,625
Highly stressful, and I
think that completely...

582
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,914
Did away with you being closed
in any way, shape, or form.

583
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:43,341
And I think that you are
in an active location.

584
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:48,622
So, inadvertently, were
made to open to some extent.

585
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:53,970
The other thing is, is that
we can become extremely ill.

586
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,151
Because of the ability.

587
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:04,828
Every physical medium that
I know has had heart issues.

588
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:09,615
So, what does the
poltergeist haunting do?

589
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:11,794
So, like, all of this
energy is out there,

590
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:14,573
and it's going and it's
going and it builds...

591
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:17,552
Spontaneously affecting the environment.

592
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:21,785
Then what can happen is it
can feed off of the dead.

593
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:25,146
So, with this guy here...

594
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:30,087
He's being absorbed and then becoming...

595
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:33,688
Part of this ball of energy.

596
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,634
And what can happen then is
when you're adding your abilities

597
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:41,256
to that ball of energy, it
can become a PK manifestation.

598
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:45,146
Which is a very dire circumstance.

599
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:47,720
Pk, from what I understand,
that can make things move.

600
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,383
- Like, objects move.
- Yes.

601
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:51,959
You'll have the objects
moving, emotional instability,

602
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,668
and some of the physical phenomena.

603
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:59,536
That's when you're getting
the deep cuts and...

604
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:05,338
You know, being thrown across the
room, and, you know, hardcore...

605
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,451
Physical...

606
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:09,404
Abuse.

607
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:15,305
I don't think it's gotten to that level
yet, but I think it is headed there.

608
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,629
Phew.

609
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:30,692
This is a lot of information
to take in one night and...

610
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:34,005
It probably wasn't the information you
actually thought you were going to hear.

611
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:36,886
But the main question is
can you live here safely?

612
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:40,270
Could the kids be safe? And
can you fix what's going on?

613
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:44,700
Hopefully, Amy may
have an answer for that.

614
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,522
We need to get the
dead out of the house.

615
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:53,423
So, to start off, you're going to be
doing home cleansings three times a week.

616
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,647
Go ahead and take your Sage.

617
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,643
Go around the house with the
Sage and just let it burn freely.

618
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:01,744
While you're saying...

619
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,376
"Only love, light, and peace may enter".

620
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:08,865
And any dead that are in
the home have to leave.

621
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,093
Okay.

622
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:15,022
Also, to eliminate this
poltergeist and to have everyone,

623
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:18,589
balanced and centered
with their energy...

624
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,630
I would suggest either
yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

625
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:28,806
At least once a week
as a family together.

626
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,708
Now, let me ask you a
question a poltergeist sounds

627
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,374
to a layman like me, it sounds
like a scary thing, right?

628
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,353
Oh, yeah.

629
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:39,042
But you're saying yoga's going
to kind of nip it in the bud?

630
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:43,020
Yes. It'll dissipate because
you won't be feeding it anymore.

631
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:46,794
You'll feel much healthier,
you'll feel much more at peace.

632
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:50,628
Because it will focus on
harnessing and balancing energy.

633
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:51,893
Okay.

634
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:53,852
So, what's going to happen to this guy?

635
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:57,873
Once the poltergeist is dissipating.

636
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:04,171
It's going to release him, and I think, at
that point, he's going to choose to leave.

637
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:08,986
And what can they do about
this thing that's bad for men?

638
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:13,468
There's something that comes
from the Earth here that...

639
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:17,010
Doesn't particularly care
for men for whatever reason.

640
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:21,066
So, I would suggest
bringing in a Shaman.

641
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:25,447
To do a cleansing ceremony on the land.

642
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,817
Okay.

643
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:31,597
Now, this whole thing of you having
abilities actually, the both of you.

644
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:34,720
When you woke up this morning this would've
been the last thing you thought of.

645
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:39,101
The last thing I thought of, absolutely.

646
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:45,629
So, the big question is, are you
going to listen to our advice?

647
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,752
Absolutely.

648
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:48,813
Definitely.

649
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:51,874
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

650
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:56,946
I really hope Emily & Erich rid their
home of the poltergeist they've created.

651
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,856
If they do that and learn
to harness their abilities,

652
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:05,757
there is no reason they shouldn't live
in their home peacefully as a family.
