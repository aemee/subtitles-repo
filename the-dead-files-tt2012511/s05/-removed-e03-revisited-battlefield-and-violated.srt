1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,142
Tonight
on "Dead Files Revisited"...

2
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,427
They're pissed.

3
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:14,678
...a second look

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,014
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,483
That's got to
scare the hell out of you.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,782
New information.

7
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,050
I had to have some answers.

8
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:22,785
Startling revelations.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,071
I'll fight to the grave
for my child.

10
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,323
In this week's episode...

11
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,259
I don't like
coming down here myself.

12
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,160
...a return
to Fort Wayne, Indiana...

13
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:34,231
This thing might be into
torturing people.

14
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,268
...where painful memories...

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,287
I feel like it violates her.

16
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:41,272
...plague a family.

17
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,440
It's the scariest thing
in the world.

18
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:48,212
But first, we travel back
to Flint, Michigan...

19
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:50,214
I felt a hand
reach around my throat.

20
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:51,647
...where a demonic presence...

21
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,483
It's not something you want
to **** with.

22
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,519
...rips a family apart.

23
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,187
I got to protect
my family.

24
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,158
And in a "Dead Files" first...

25
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:03,060
You got
a serious problem.

26
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,664
...the battle for Kathy's soul
caught on camera.

27
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,934
In the name
of the Father and of the Son

28
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,134
and of the Holy Sprit, Amen.

29
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,203
No! No!

30
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,458
It's really bad in here.

31
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:20,335
My name is Amy Allan.

32
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,178
Something is not right.

33
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,712
I see dead people.

34
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:25,416
This person might have been a
serial killer.

35
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,318
I speak to dead people.

36
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,154
You get those chills.

37
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,920
And they speak to me.

38
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,888
He is darkness.
He is evil.

39
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:36,026
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

40
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,893
I think she broke her neck.

41
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,296
I rely on my partner.

42
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,663
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

43
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:43,399
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,733
Telling me the truth?

45
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:48,005
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,372
I think the devil is down here.

47
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,808
It's my job to reveal them.

48
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,744
Who the hell would do this?

49
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,610
But Steve and I never speak...

50
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,747
We never communicate
during an investigation.

51
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,099
...until the very end.

52
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,382
Who is he looking to kill?

53
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,569
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

54
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,721
You need to get out of here
right now.

55
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,853
Or time to get out.

56
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,491
It was, like, endless darkness.

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,078
Our investigation
at a home in Flint, Michigan,

58
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,110
was intense.

59
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,578
The family that called us in

60
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,149
were living through hell
before we got there.

61
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,716
But what happened after we left

62
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,186
is without a doubt
one of the most shocking things

63
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,254
any of our clients
have ever faced.

64
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,791
Kathy, things are pretty bad
here, it sounds like.

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,791
Yes.

66
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:43,960
My husband and five kids.

67
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:46,361
Five years,
we've been here.

68
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:49,132
There's people
being scratched, clawed,

69
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,366
things thrown at,

70
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,104
and it hits the kids
extremely hard.

71
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,572
You okay?

72
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,108
Yeah. Just --
It's a hard subject.

73
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:03,114
The things that's happened
here -- I call it a black life.

74
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,548
I don't have
what we used to have --

75
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,419
the joy, the laughter,
anything like that.

76
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,519
It's pure dread.

77
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay, so,
what's going on in here?

78
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,691
We see black masses
and a headless man.

79
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:21,430
He'll say, "Get out. It's mine.
My house. Leave."

80
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,066
Well, that's got to scare the
hell out of you, I would think.

81
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,468
Yes, it does.

82
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:42,052
As usual, I had no previous
knowledge of the location --

83
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,622
who lived there,
who died there, nothing.

84
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,122
But as soon as I walked
onto the property,

85
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:51,028
I sensed this case was going to
get very serious very quickly.

86
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,697
I'm hearing growls.

87
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:59,736
It's, like, not an animal.
It's not human.

88
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,006
It's very, very dark.

89
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,811
It went right through the wall.

90
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:12,248
Was this the thing
that was growling? - Yes.

91
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:15,119
I think that some people
have seen it as a blackness,

92
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,988
but, like, it definitely morphs.

93
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,256
It ended up taking hours

94
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,442
to figure out
what that creature was.

95
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,594
And the fact
that it could change shape

96
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:25,961
only made things worse.

97
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,667
I just saw it, like,
turn into a big spider thing.

98
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,023
It's not something
you want to **** with.

99
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:40,777
There was a time
when I went out here

100
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,981
and I felt a hand
reach around my throat,

101
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:44,881
and I couldn't breathe.

102
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,282
Wow.

103
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,185
That's probably
the most physical interaction

104
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,484
I've heard about.

105
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,089
I haven't even told you
the worst of it.

106
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:56,559
One night, laying in bed,
I was grabbed.

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,796
And, of course, I check
on my one son, Mikey,

108
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:03,234
And somebody had his leg and
was pulling him off the bed.

109
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,437
What were they
gonna do to him?

110
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,073
With all that's happened here,

111
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,506
I don't think about myself.

112
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,127
What comes first is my husband,
my children.

113
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,938
I mean, they are the ones
I'm protecting.

114
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:18,715
I don't care, kind of,
what happened to me,

115
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,333
as long as they were safe.

116
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,917
How do you live
like that?

117
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:23,185
It's not living.

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,722
You just pray
for a fire.

119
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,021
It'll be the relief

120
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:29,092
that you can actually breathe
a little bit.

121
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,299
I see this woman
who...

122
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:40,971
she just sees everything
in her life...

123
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,573
falling apart --

124
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,106
And she's tough,

125
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,044
but, you know,
she's broken now.

126
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,644
She's just broken.

127
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:53,083
Like, I think she's had thoughts
of burning down the house.

128
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,988
It's pretty bad.

129
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,425
I spoke with Kathy's son Zach,

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,792
who claimed
that a male apparition

131
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:07,631
was watching him at night,
and over time, things got worse.

132
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,034
I was scratched
in the bedroom.

133
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,568
What do you mean?
You got scratches?

134
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,439
I had the word "LEAVE"
scratched on my stomach.

135
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:20,344
That sure as hell
does say that, does it?

136
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,144
That was a serious red flag,

137
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,312
and I went
straight to Kathy's husband.

138
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:26,950
But after hearing
some of his violent encounters,

139
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,686
I realized
this wasn't just a case

140
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,388
of their kid acting out
for attention.

141
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:38,595
One day I was out here
working on the truck,

142
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,598
and pretty soon,
something hit me in the back.

143
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,233
It was a piece
of broken concrete.

144
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:44,966
Anything else?

145
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,803
I had a one-inch wrench
thrown at me.

146
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,589
The kids were all in bed.

147
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,066
Made a believer out of me.

148
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,508
What's your biggest fear?

149
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,679
My biggest fear is somebody's
really gonna get hurt.

150
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,212
Right.

151
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:06,272
So, there's been a lot of chaos
in this area.

152
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:13,063
I think the thing is in here
quite frequently.

153
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,332
It gets really,
really physical --

154
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,567
moving things
very harshly around,

155
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,036
like it doesn't like it.

156
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:24,458
I chased that creature
all over the property,

157
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:27,286
trying to get some idea
of how to stop it.

158
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,045
And when I managed
to corner it in the garage,

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,018
it finally lost the disguise and
unveiled its horrific true form.

160
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:39,221
It's a demon,

161
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:42,592
and it creates
this sick, twisted environment

162
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,445
for everyone.

163
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,228
Next...

164
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:48,132
It looks like brains
are coming out of their mouth.

165
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,034
...a grisly entity
loses control.

166
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,834
"I've got you ****"

167
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,072
And in our
second investigation...

168
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,174
A lot of bad things
happened there.

169
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,240
...pure evil...

170
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,244
It's the scariest thing
in the world.

171
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,212
...hides in the shadows.

172
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:06,383
Whatever's here,
get the hell out.

173
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,463
Our clients had mentioned

174
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,166
the previous owner
of their house, Bill,

175
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,418
died in the living room.

176
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,600
And for some strange reason,

177
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:28,171
they kept his furniture
and even slept on his mattress.

178
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,244
And now knowing what I know
about this case,

179
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,643
that was probably a bad idea

180
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,114
because according
to one of the neighbors,

181
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,183
that guy Bill had a dark side.

182
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,322
I used to call him
old Wild Bill.

183
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,526
Now, I was told that he had
a mean side to him.

184
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,593
Is that true?

185
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,145
After his wife passed away
and that,

186
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,662
I think he started
drinking more.

187
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:57,601
And I think he got a little bit
more cantankerous and that.

188
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,620
How did Bill feel
about his house itself?

189
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,314
Well, they kept that place
immaculate there.

190
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,974
Inside the house,
everything was real nice.

191
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,575
I know
if anybody was in there

192
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,279
and they was messing with his
tools or anything like that,

193
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,814
he'd probably roll right over
in his grave.

194
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,949
I believe that
with all my heart.

195
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,150
You do?

196
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:14,768
Yeah.

197
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:15,352
Okay.

198
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:19,554
I just see people fighting,

199
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,393
and this man comes in
from the closet.

200
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,162
He says, "Ha ha.
I've got you ****"

201
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:31,135
And he, like, tries
to sleep in the bed.

202
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:36,138
I couldn't put my finger on it
at first,

203
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:38,942
but something about that man
was off.

204
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,583
They're not making any sense.

205
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:51,087
I can't get the thought process
out of him.

206
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,888
His actions appeared malicious,

207
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,426
but his ability to communicate
was completely impaired.

208
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,260
It looks like
intestines or brains

209
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:02,199
are coming, like,
out of their mouth or something.

210
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,134
I can't communicate

211
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,372
because their brains, literally,
are scrambled.

212
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:12,574
Unfortunately,
what ever happened to that man

213
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:16,179
had left him as nothing more
than a shell of his former self.

214
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:19,233
Can you
describe him at all?

215
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:22,528
This person's white, male.

216
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:25,789
I feel like his body is frail.

217
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,356
The guy
could have been on drugs,

218
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:32,228
and it's almost like
it's a lost cause or something.

219
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:36,065
This person is here
most of the time in this room.

220
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:42,139
Aside from
an accidental death in the 1930s

221
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,605
and the previous owner

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,409
dying of natural causes
in the living room,

223
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,142
the records were pretty clean

224
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,478
for a home
that was over 100 years old.

225
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:52,750
I figured that was the end of
the road for my investigation,

226
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,952
until I stumbled
onto a piece of history

227
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,388
that I just couldn't ignore.

228
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:06,930
It turns out,
the property I'm investigating

229
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,998
used to be
Native American land.

230
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,367
Pretty horrific stuff
went on there.

231
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,167
What can you tell me
about it?

232
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:16,072
Well, this was the land
of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe.

233
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,707
They were a very fierce,
very warlike tribe.

234
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:21,612
The United States government
was terrified of these guys.

235
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,031
Most of the Saginaw Chippewa
warriors

236
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,459
were very much aligned
with the British,

237
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,852
who were coming
to fight the Americans

238
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,254
in the War of 1812.

239
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:35,324
This is a picture
of United States troops.

240
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,261
Okay, so, what happened with
them during the War of 1812?

241
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,664
The Native Americans
would take hostages.

242
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,033
They would capture soldiers
in battle,

243
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,651
swoop down
on a settlement,

244
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,200
and literally
ransom them back

245
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,537
to white representatives
for money.

246
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,640
When they were POWs,
what were they treated like?

247
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,577
It would have been a very, very
tough thing to be a prisoner.

248
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,381
The winter season would have
been very, very difficult.

249
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,681
Food would have been
at a premium.

250
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:02,019
There are accounts of people
being tortured to death.

251
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:12,460
There's, like,
a lot of dead men over there,

252
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:16,333
and they're all a mess,
and it's very, very muddy.

253
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,471
Like, their clothes
are just kind of tattered.

254
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,474
They have long, gray,
wool coats on.

255
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,242
In that sea
of residual entities,

256
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,375
10 stood out in the crowd

257
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,078
because they were
still conscious

258
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:31,546
and unaware they had died.

259
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,648
And now they're just stuck
in an endless loop

260
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:36,553
of trying to interact with
people who are not really there.

261
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,455
I think a lot of them are sick.

262
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,326
They haven't had, like,
proper meals in a long time.

263
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,613
They're just, like,
pretty miserable.

264
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,866
I just think
they're trying to get home.

265
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,999
Next...

266
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,102
You got
a serious problem.

267
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,139
In a "Dead Files" first...

268
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,074
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost,

269
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,809
Spirit, what is your name?

270
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,176
No! No!

271
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,246
...the moment no one saw coming.

272
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:06,449
I'm not going anywhere!

273
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:37,912
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Mike and Kathy.

274
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:41,852
The night of the reveal,
it was the first time I met Amy.

275
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,454
She was scary because if
she could see these things here,

276
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,522
could she see
something within me?

277
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:48,858
They're actually afraid
for their lives,

278
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,794
and they feel like
we're their last hope.

279
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:56,764
So, I'm outside
and I saw these 10 men.

280
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,769
They were wearing, like, torn
and tattered long, gray coats.

281
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,555
And they were very ill.

282
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,271
That's interesting.

283
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,939
The land
that your property sits on

284
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,711
used to belong to the Chippewa
Saginaw Indian tribes.

285
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,012
During the war of 1812,

286
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,180
they would kidnap
American soldiers.

287
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:13,850
These guys
lived under the worst conditions

288
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:15,285
when they were hostages.

289
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,651
Take a look at that.

290
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:20,924
You see the uniform colors
on the American soldiers?

291
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,292
Wow.

292
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,693
Amy confirmed what I see --

293
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:28,198
people walking across the hills,
walking across the property.

294
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,664
I didn't know
they were soldiers,

295
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,884
so that was neat
to find out about that

296
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,069
but sad
because they're stuck here.

297
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,774
I saw an individual
in the master bedroom

298
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,274
jump out of the closet.

299
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:42,145
He was ripping covers
off the bed.

300
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,283
That happens.

301
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:52,155
Several times,
I've felt being grabbed.

302
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,321
He was white

303
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:56,391
and he was on some kind
of substance.

304
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,862
The man that lived in your house
before you guys bought it

305
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,329
was this guy named Bill.

306
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,230
Back in the '90s,
his wife passed away,

307
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:04,033
and from that time,
he took a downward spiral,

308
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,267
started drinking heavily.

309
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,535
Eventually,
he did die in the house.

310
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,156
The odd part is,
when they bought the house,

311
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,742
they bought most
of the furniture with it.

312
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:17,230
And they're actually sleeping
on Bill's mattress.

313
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,183
Would them keeping his furniture
make things worse?

314
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:24,488
Yeah. Beds hold a lot
of residual energy.

315
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:28,489
I'm not gonna be settled
until it's gone.

316
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:31,294
We thought
instead of having them move it,

317
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,896
we would take the furniture
with the home.

318
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,231
Now I regret it a lot.

319
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:40,203
We kept it his place,
not our place.

320
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,323
What else you see?

321
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,374
So, there's one entity

322
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,444
that's actually interacting
with the family,

323
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,245
and it's extremely
powerful.

324
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,848
And pretty much
all of the problems

325
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,185
is generated
by this thing.

326
00:15:56,453 --> 00:16:00,555
One of Kathy's boys
showed me these pictures.

327
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:04,027
Now, I don't know if you can see
what's scratched into his chest.

328
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,498
It spells "LEAVE."

329
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,664
Yeah.

330
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,033
Could this thing do that?

331
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,303
You know,
I wouldn't discount that

332
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,539
because it is
an advanced entity.

333
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:17,975
It knows
what scares you.

334
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:23,313
"Leave" -- that one word.

335
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:25,346
One word haunts me.

336
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:30,120
How can it tell me to leave
when it should be gone?

337
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,006
Well,
I had the sketch artist

338
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,858
sketch
the most disturbing scene.

339
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:38,026
She's kneeling down.

340
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:41,931
On the wall,
I would like there to be

341
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,102
the outline
of just a shadow.

342
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,340
Who's the kid?

343
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,609
God.

344
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,376
Mikey.

345
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:59,116
She's the one I called
the babysitter.

346
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,452
And you see
who she really is.

347
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:05,887
It's the entity.

348
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,492
When I seen the sketch,
I knew who it was.

349
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:12,645
It was just an automatic
kick to the chest.

350
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,764
But I'm not gonna let it
touch my kids.

351
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,583
I'll fight to the grave.

352
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,367
I will fight for my child.

353
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:24,106
There was someone
who was into dark magic

354
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:28,411
add conjured up
this entity, this demon thing.

355
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,415
- It's a demon, then?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,153
It sought out living people
to begin gaining more power.

357
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:40,821
It's making people fight
in the house.

358
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:44,627
When Amy was telling me
about the demon here,

359
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:46,294
I knew what the outcome
was gonna be.

360
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,132
I knew she was gonna tell us
that we couldn't be here.

361
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,135
Well, Kathy,
my big question is,

362
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,888
can you stay in this house
safely?

363
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:57,572
I believe the best thing
you could do

364
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:01,211
for yourselves and your children
is to relocate.

365
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,682
If they do decide to stay
and can't afford to move,

366
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,881
what can they do?

367
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,985
There is definitely
PTSD here,

368
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,419
and that's something

369
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,589
that needs to be addressed
through counseling.

370
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:15,190
While that's happening,

371
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,794
the Catholic priest must do
an exorcism of the property

372
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:22,632
and then remove the dead man
from the location, as well.

373
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,567
Would that get rid
of the demon?

374
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:25,967
Yes.

375
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:30,706
It's not too often that
this is the advice Amy gives,

376
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:34,077
but for her to give it, it must
mean you got a serious problem.

377
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:52,228
After the investigation,
I felt defeated.

378
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,695
The house defeated me.

379
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,299
I was hurt
because this was the house

380
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,899
that we wanted to call home.

381
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:02,706
So I decided to fight it off as
much as we can -- call for help.

382
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,378
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

383
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,911
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

384
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:14,283
When the priest got here,
we went from room to room.

385
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:16,918
Walk in your ways
and in your truth forever.

386
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,419
Burned the incense

387
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:21,389
and put holy water in all
four corners of every room...

388
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,761
♪ Christ God
has appeared to us ♪

389
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,562
♪ And glory to thee ♪

390
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:32,701
...and tried to bless
the house to eliminate Bill.

391
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:38,041
After that, the priest done
a baptism on the family

392
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,408
to bring God
back into our lives.

393
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,946
Surround her with your angels,
that she may be clean,

394
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,483
that she may walk in your ways
and in your truth forever.

395
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,736
But when
the priest baptized me,

396
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,920
it felt like stabs
to my own body.

397
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:56,258
And that's when he told me that
an exorcism had to been done

398
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,659
because a demon's
attached to me.

399
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:02,331
And without it leaving me,
it's gonna continue.

400
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,399
In the name of the Father

401
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:07,437
and the Son and the Holy Ghost,
Spirit, what is your name?

402
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,437
No! No! No!

403
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:12,041
I remember
bits and pieces of it.

404
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:15,078
I'm not going anywhere!

405
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,080
Sprit,
what is your name?

406
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,799
My land!

407
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,449
Mine!

408
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:25,155
I was being held down by two
of my kids and by husband.

409
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,257
Spirit,
this is no longer your land.

410
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,126
You must go to Christ.

411
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,461
Go to the place

412
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:36,631
that Christ has prepared
for you.

413
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:41,870
It was so many emotions -- hate,
agony, anger -- a lot of anger.

414
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:45,508
And this demon
is doing his bidding through me.

415
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,146
Bring her radiant
guardian angel down.

416
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,414
Be gone!

417
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,149
Looking back on it now,
I think,

418
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,320
"Why did I have to
go through this hell?

419
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,156
What did I do
to deserve this?"

420
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,023
She may walk
in your ways.

421
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,861
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

422
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:08,498
How are you feeling?

423
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,135
He's gone?

424
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:20,744
What my family went through --
that's always going to haunt me.

425
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:28,451
Since the exorcism, it was
a new day -- a new day born.

426
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:31,555
The kids have already
been seeing a therapist,

427
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,225
and we are actually
on a waiting list to see one.

428
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,861
But with all that's
happened here, we're moving.

429
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,730
We have actually found a house

430
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:45,551
far away from the hell
that's there.

431
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:49,338
I'm not
gonna go through this again.

432
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,839
In my experience,

433
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,444
it's rare for a living person
to become possessed.

434
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,710
But if that demon
took control of Kathy,

435
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,448
then I can only imagine
what she went through.

436
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:02,284
I know it's been a difficult
journey for this family,

437
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,120
but hopefully they can put
this chaos behind them

438
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,189
and begin
rebuilding their lives.

439
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:22,036
As soon as I met Mark,

440
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,672
our client
in Fort Wayne, Indiana,

441
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,006
I knew he was in trouble.

442
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,510
He said that paranormal activity
was tearing his family apart

443
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,078
and he no longer had a way
to protect them.

444
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:33,416
And he had every right to be
concerned because looking back,

445
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,435
this household
was in more danger

446
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,419
than anyone
could have anticipated.

447
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,020
Mark, what's going on?

448
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,155
I've seen an apparition.

449
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,092
I've been touched,
hit with things.

450
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:46,262
We'll go sometimes
for like a month or two,

451
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:47,495
and nothing will happen.

452
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,598
And then it'll be continuous
for weeks.

453
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,751
I started out,
I was scared of it,

454
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,870
and now I'm at the point
I hate it.

455
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,536
It was crazy.

456
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,340
It was affecting my work,
my wife, and my daughter,

457
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,641
and I had to have some answers

458
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,277
and figure out
what I was gonna do

459
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:02,877
because
I just couldn't live here.

460
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,114
Why don't you just sell
the house and get out of here?

461
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,317
You know, it's finances,
and the thing is, it's my house.

462
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,501
There is something
definitely not right

463
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,568
about the land.

464
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,803
The second I set foot
on that property,

465
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:31,774
I could sense the residents
of that home were in danger.

466
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:34,310
It would end up taking me
most of the night

467
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:36,379
to identify
what they were up against,

468
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,414
and unfortunately,
this wasn't going to be

469
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,414
an easy problem to fix.

470
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:44,253
A lot of bad things happened
there with that family.

471
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:48,824
There was also, like,
a murder that happened.

472
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:54,430
I feel weak, like something's
trying to jump me.

473
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:58,701
This thing might be
into torturing people.

474
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,700
Next...

475
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,971
I felt fingers
running through my hair.

476
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,307
...the danger becomes real.

477
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,609
I feel like it violates her.

478
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,689
Listening to Mark's stories

479
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:24,460
about the activity in his house,
the guy was definitely scared.

480
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:26,862
But his biggest fear
was his basement,

481
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:28,229
and knowing how this case ends,

482
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:30,099
Mark should have listened
to his gut

483
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,899
and stayed
the hell out of there.

484
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,870
I was sweeping
the floor down here.

485
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:35,937
A fairly decent-sized bolt

486
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:37,289
hit me in
the center of the back.

487
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:38,606
- You were down here alone?
- I was down here alone.

488
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,042
I don't like
coming down here myself.

489
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,642
It creeps me out.

490
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:45,648
I was worried that someone
was gonna eventually get hurt --

491
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,902
get pushed down the stairs
or God knows what.

492
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:52,121
I mean, if these things
can move large objects,

493
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,621
what else can they do?

494
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:55,657
Have you experienced
anything else down here?

495
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:57,659
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see shadows
down here a lot.

496
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,760
What kind of shadows?

497
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,913
They're like a solid black mass
or something.

498
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:02,996
You'll catch them
out of the corner of the eye.

499
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:07,036
It feels sometimes almost like
things hide down here.

500
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:19,181
There is something very bad here
that's not a human.

501
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:23,384
This big gigantic black blob.

502
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:25,054
There is a lot
of physical phenomena

503
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,354
that this thing can do --

504
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:31,159
throwing people down stairs
or smacking them.

505
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,928
It's a pretty powerful thing.

506
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:36,831
A mass
of negative energy like that

507
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,466
is never good for the living,

508
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,671
but I felt confident I could
find a way to contain it,

509
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,438
at least that was
until I turned around

510
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:48,310
and saw that the black mass had
a reach far beyond the house.

511
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:51,313
And there is, like,
definitely a pathway here.

512
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:58,788
I think it goes possibly
next door or underground.

513
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:04,659
This thing might be
into torturing people.

514
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:08,964
Mark's wife, Kim, had
experiences similar to his own,

515
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,001
but unlike Mark, the effect
on her sanity was severe.

516
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:14,636
Ever since I've been here,

517
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:17,838
it's like I've just been
totally drained of energy.

518
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:20,810
I would assume this has got to
take a toll on your marriage.

519
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,643
Yeah, it does.

520
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:25,715
But the breaking point for me
was when Mark's daughter

521
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,085
revealed how the activity
in their home

522
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,420
was un-bottling
her difficult past.

523
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:38,160
Shaela, I was talking
to your dad earlier,

524
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,693
and he mentioned

525
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,664
that you're uncomfortable
being in the house alone.

526
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:45,016
Okay, how long
have you been living here?

527
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:46,735
I've been living here
about five months now.

528
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,102
Mark's my dad,

529
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:51,272
and we just found each other
when I turned 18.

530
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:55,811
What kinds of things are you
experiencing in the house?

531
00:26:55,846 --> 00:27:00,316
I get this, like, weird vibe
of, like, sadness and anger.

532
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:02,550
I was not a believer

533
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:06,288
of anything paranormal
until I moved here.

534
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:09,992
But it felt like something
was out to get me.

535
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:13,428
I was absolutely shocked
and frightened

536
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,796
because it really reminded me
of my past.

537
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,833
Now, what's the most frightening
thing in the house for you?

538
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,037
I've felt, like, fingers running
through my hair.

539
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,105
It just absolutely
just mortifies me.

540
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,405
What do you mean by that?

541
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,476
I had a rough past.

542
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:31,245
I was abused...sexually.

543
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,349
And when I feel
these things,

544
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:37,384
it reminds me
of my childhood.

545
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:40,523
Like, I'll hear
the door handle turn.

546
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,726
And then...

547
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,964
So, that doorknob turning
brings you back

548
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,633
to when you were...
molested.

549
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,771
It's the scariest thing
in the world.

550
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,371
The pain that you felt

551
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:59,707
just plays over and over
in your head

552
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:03,128
and next thing you know,
you're just in tears.

553
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:06,515
Something paranormal's
bringing back that memory,

554
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,117
and it just hurts.

555
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,992
This older woman, she is
concerned about someone --

556
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,394
like, a girl
who lives in this house.

557
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:23,966
And this woman
feels like she's a protector

558
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,168
from this black shadow thing.

559
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,305
The situation
is really, really dire,

560
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,108
and that's why she's here.

561
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,675
From what I could tell,

562
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,646
the older woman
was doing everything she could

563
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,379
to protect the living
in the house.

564
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:41,750
Unfortunately,
going up against that black mass

565
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,117
was a losing battle.

566
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:45,805
I feel like it violates her.

567
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,458
What do you mean?

568
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,561
Like, kind of sexually.

569
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:58,198
It's not good.

570
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,202
She stabbed him
in the back.

571
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,369
Next...

572
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:03,938
He doesn't like the people here.

573
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,942
...resentment builds to rage.

574
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:09,078
I feel like I'm being attacked.

575
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,291
The only lead
I had on Mark's home

576
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:28,030
was that one of the prior owners
might have been murdered.

577
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,716
Apparently,
this happened recently,

578
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,332
so I found
a local retired detective

579
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,137
who used to patrol the area
to give me the full story.

580
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,310
So, A.J.,
my client said

581
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,748
there was a possible murder
in his house

582
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,847
back in the '90s,

583
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:50,252
Right.
Back in December of '96.

584
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,587
This was the victim,
Alberto Lopez.

585
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,258
He looks like a young guy.
How old was he?

586
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:57,992
He was only 25.

587
00:29:58,027 --> 00:29:59,678
So, how'd the homicide
go down?

588
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:01,722
He had a live-in girlfriend.

589
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,732
They got
into an altercation,

590
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,466
and he took off running.

591
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:08,770
She had a knife,
and she stabbed him in the back.

592
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,205
It was a fatal blow,

593
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,008
and he died right there
on the floor,

594
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,343
right in front
of the stove.

595
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:17,946
A.J., what do we know
about the victim?

596
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,380
Not much of anything.

597
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,883
Nobody even knew him.

598
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:27,555
No next of kin stepped forward
to shed any light on who he was,

599
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:29,392
and nobody even claimed
the body.

600
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,327
Now, I'm assuming
she gets collared for this.

601
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,227
- She gets arrested, right?
- She gets arrested.

602
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:38,300
Ends up taking a charge
of aggravated battery

603
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:39,633
and got 10 years.

604
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:41,102
Now, what's her story?

605
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,304
She was claiming
domestic abuse.

606
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,173
She had
told people that,

607
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,642
"The next time he hits me,
that's it.

608
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:48,875
I'm gonna kill him."

609
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,714
She was
at a breaking point.

610
00:30:56,752 --> 00:31:02,725
I feel like
there's a younger male here

611
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,360
who doesn't want to be bothered.

612
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:08,331
And he'll lash out.

613
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:16,471
Do you know when he died?

614
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,323
I would say like...
'90s.

615
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:20,141
Do you get an age on him?

616
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:21,877
25 maybe?

617
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,613
He's creepy.

618
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:28,982
He doesn't like
the people here.

619
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:33,121
Sometimes, an entity may want
to isolate themselves

620
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:34,855
from the outside world

621
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,326
while they're trying to accept
the fact that they're dead.

622
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,662
That young man could not
come to grips with reality,

623
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:43,599
and his denial
was building into resentment.

624
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:47,520
People are not
leaving him alone.

625
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:51,407
So, he is distraught over this.

626
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:58,347
He has so much anxiety,
so much stress, so much anger.

627
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,650
It wasn't long
before I uncovered

628
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:06,154
that the family who owned
Mark's property in the 1800s

629
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:08,256
had practically built
the town of Fort Wayne.

630
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:12,360
Money and power
usually get you ahead in life,

631
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:14,930
but according
to a local genealogist,

632
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,500
that's what ended up
destroying them.

633
00:32:24,206 --> 00:32:25,340
John, when I did
my research,

634
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,541
I came across
the Olds family.

635
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,708
What can you tell me
about them?

636
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,211
They were
one of the top families

637
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:30,345
in Fort Wayne
in the 1800s.

638
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,113
This is Henry G. Olds.

639
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,983
He inherited the property
back in 1876.

640
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,819
He had a lot
of mercantile interests.

641
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,520
When did Henry die?

642
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:42,523
He died in 1902.
He was 62 years old.

643
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,444
He died at his house,
leaving a widow, Caroline,

644
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:48,890
and several sons
who took over his businesses.

645
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,301
So, what happens to Caroline
after he dies?

646
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,669
I'm just seeing, like,

647
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,906
these two dead old men
talking a lot.

648
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:00,326
They weren't paid well.

649
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,871
They had no rights.

650
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:05,278
And...they're pissed.

651
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:07,615
They're just **** pissed.

652
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,018
Well, there was
a series of lawsuits

653
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,320
that really harmed
the family.

654
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:12,687
Well, why is that?

655
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:14,389
They're mad about
their living conditions.

656
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,792
They're mad about
how they died.

657
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,225
It was not a safe place.

658
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,262
People were
really unprotected,

659
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:22,229
and one of the workers
was killed.

660
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:24,632
And his widow sued
the company for $10,000.

661
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:26,501
That was a lot of money
back then.

662
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:27,668
A lot of money, yes,

663
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,555
and that certainly took
a big chunk out of their wealth.

664
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,442
The coal company also got hit
with a big lawsuit in 1913.

665
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:36,611
Like, I do feel like
they worked underground,

666
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:39,648
like they were miners
or something of that nature.

667
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,617
And the one said,
"I died with my boots on."

668
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:44,786
A man was killed

669
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:46,922
when some coal was being
unloaded from a train.

670
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,858
Okay, so they wind up
losing a lot

671
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,759
between lawsuits
and accidents.

672
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,560
Yes.

673
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:58,066
All I see is earth
rushing in on him.

674
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,235
God.

675
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,268
Next...

676
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:03,171
It can get physical
and violent.

677
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,438
...the clients...

678
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:06,039
All hell broke loose in here.

679
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,142
...confront their demons.

680
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:10,713
Whatever's here,
get the hell out.

681
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:32,366
Amy, this is Mark,
this is his wife, Kim,

682
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,467
and this is his daughter,
Shaela.

683
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,621
I was scared
because I wanted to find out

684
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:38,740
if there's a way
of correcting the problems

685
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,106
that were happening here.

686
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:42,526
I was mainly worried
about Kim and Shaela

687
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,912
because if Amy said
they can't be here,

688
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:46,615
I don't know
how they would have handled it.

689
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,283
They feel
we're their last hope,

690
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,316
and that's why
they called us in.

691
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:53,788
So I encountered
two old, angry men.

692
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:57,225
They're very pissed off about
how they died,

693
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:59,995
which seemed to be
in some kind of an accident.

694
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,762
A family called the Olds family

695
00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:04,966
owned this property
before it was developed.

696
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,667
Now, they owned factories here,

697
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,404
and the way they mistreated
their employees

698
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:12,041
wound up being
the demise of them.

699
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,608
So when Henry Olds
dies in 1902,

700
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:17,079
his wife, Caroline,
got hit with a few lawsuits

701
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,265
from the families
of mistreated workers.

702
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,526
I thought
it was very interesting

703
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,891
that she found the two men
in the basement.

704
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:26,221
There are times
where you can hear kind of like

705
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,006
a whispering voice in the house,

706
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,984
and I think that put an answer

707
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,090
to those noises
that we'll hear.

708
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,278
What else did you see?

709
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:36,397
In the garage,
I met a male,

710
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:39,067
probably between
18 and 25 years old.

711
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,735
He, frankly,
doesn't want to be bothered.

712
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,405
And he feels like his space
is being violated.

713
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,644
In my mind, it sounded like Amy
was talking about Alberto Lopez,

714
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,182
the man whose girlfriend
killed him in the house.

715
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,183
She stabs him
one time in the back,

716
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,586
and he winds up dying
upstairs in the kitchen.

717
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,087
Wow.

718
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,854
When they first revealed to me

719
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:03,425
about Alberto being stabbed
to death in the kitchen

720
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,061
and his spirit
staying in the garage,

721
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,627
I really wasn't sure
how to take that,

722
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:10,198
but I made up my mind that I'm
gonna have to address it myself.

723
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,866
Down here in the basement,

724
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:16,370
I saw,
this funky, nasty thing.

725
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:21,509
It's rather large,
very powerful,

726
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:22,676
and...negative.

727
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:25,981
Sometimes, I could see it
as a dark blob

728
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,933
I've seen
a black blob.

729
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,851
It was like it was alive.

730
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,351
It just took off.

731
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:35,758
So I had a sketch artist
sketch the scene I saw.

732
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,593
Is he looking at you?

733
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:39,659
Yes.

734
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:41,780
A very solid black.

735
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,866
He is like this.

736
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,334
Okay.

737
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,239
My God.

738
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,674
Wow.

739
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:56,009
I'm just horrified.

740
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:58,379
When Amy pulled out the sketch

741
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,216
of the dark entity
that's living in the basement,

742
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:02,883
my heart kind of stopped.

743
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:06,186
I was definitely really upset.

744
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,773
This thing
is really what's causing,

745
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,325
you know,
havoc within the house.

746
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:15,029
Frankly, I'm surprised that
it hasn't become<i> more</i> violent,

747
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,229
It just really scares me,

748
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,700
because
I don't want it

749
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:20,102
to get more physical.

750
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,576
At this point in the
reveal, Amy's demeanor changed.

751
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,878
I've seen that look on her face
many times,

752
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,144
and I knew our clients

753
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,547
were about to hear
something powerful.

754
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,716
There was a woman
that I met.

755
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:40,322
And she's very concerned about
a girl who lives in this house.

756
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,088
She's afraid
that this girl

757
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:44,993
might be getting sexually
assaulted by the entity.

758
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,526
God.

759
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:50,999
I really wanted her to say
that there's nothing wrong

760
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,833
and everything was okay

761
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:56,337
because I can't take
any more of that in my life.

762
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,405
When I was a kid...

763
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,611
I was sexually assaulted
repeatedly

764
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:05,480
for about
six or seven years.

765
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:06,379
My gosh.

766
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:07,581
Now that I'm here,

767
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,920
I feel safe, but I hear things
in the house that...

768
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:14,488
...will get me flashbacks of my
childhood. - Right.

769
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:18,460
I don't want, like, something
paranormal violating me.

770
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:22,497
Describe the finger
going through the hair.

771
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,464
It just feels like
someone, like,

772
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:26,301
just kind of, like,
caressing.

773
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:27,734
Sometimes it's lovingly.

774
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:29,504
Could it be
this woman that showed up?

775
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,637
Could be, yes.

776
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:32,506
I'm not sure
who she is,

777
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,610
but you do have a female here
who's looking out for you.

778
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:39,214
When Amy said the thing
about the older woman,

779
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,681
I find that comforting to know

780
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,416
that something
is looking out for her.

781
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:44,386
If there's something else
on the other side

782
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,706
that's messing with you,
it's nice to know

783
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,991
you got a little bit of support
on that side.

784
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,424
The question is,

785
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:54,096
can you guys live here together
as a family?

786
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,032
Dealing with
the negative entity --

787
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,434
get a warlock in here.

788
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:03,705
This needs to be a male witch
who's very masculine.

789
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,341
This individual
would do a banishment ritual

790
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,176
to send him
to where he belongs,

791
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:09,345
which I believe is Hell.

792
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,016
So why does it have to be a
masculine male witch or warlock?

793
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:19,688
Because this entity
is intimidated by you.

794
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:25,125
That's why he picks on women,
because he's a coward.

795
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:26,559
What about this guy
in the garage?

796
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:30,199
Have a very short, to-the-point
conversation with him.

797
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,385
And give him
the time and space

798
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,501
for him to work
his issues out,

799
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:38,340
as long as he doesn't bother you
or your family.

800
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:41,608
Now, I want youse all
to look me in the eye

801
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:43,245
and promise me you're gonna
listen to Amy's advice.

802
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:04,432
After Amy and Steve left,
all hell broke loose in here.

803
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:08,102
It's almost like we agitated it,
pissed it off, maybe.

804
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:12,007
So we had to get things
taken care of.

805
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,945
What Amy had told me to do

806
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,351
was to address the spirit
in the garage, which I did.

807
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,617
Okay, Alberto,
here's the deal --

808
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:28,256
I'll let you have your space
until you do what you got to do.

809
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,223
I told him he could stay

810
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:30,490
as long
as he wasn't raising hell

811
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,427
or doing anything
he's not supposed to do.

812
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:34,227
If you come in the house,

813
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:36,463
I'm gonna do something
to get you out.

814
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:39,601
I feel that it worked
and that Alberto left.

815
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,173
Whatever's here,
it can be released.

816
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,174
When the warlock first got here,

817
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,378
it was kind of like the calm
before the storm.

818
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,643
There was, like, a tension,

819
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:52,545
almost like
right before a fight.

820
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,051
I've seen some strange things
in my life, but that was crazy.

821
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,184
This has a bit
of dragon's blood.

822
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:03,725
I'm gonna literally nuke it and
neutralize the house as it is.

823
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,326
Once he's out,
he can't get back in.

824
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:10,064
As the warlock got doing
his thing in the basement,

825
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,767
it was like there was, like,
a battle of wills going on.

826
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:18,874
I felt like there was
a dark entity in the basement.

827
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:22,842
Whatever's here,
get the hell out.

828
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:26,114
And then he started using
this Tibetan singing bowl.

829
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,087
I protect and seal this off,
and get the hell out.

830
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,928
And the energy
did seem to graze,

831
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:45,733
but it was a very angry energy,
like it didn't want to leave.

832
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,238
Get out.

833
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:59,612
After the warlock left,

834
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,748
so far,
things are holding pretty good.

835
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:05,086
I feel, like, more
comfortable being in the house.

836
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,288
It's something
that's really helped me

837
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:08,788
move forward in my life

838
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:12,060
and not fear anything
that's happened in my past.

839
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,145
Things feel better
than they were,

840
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,196
but I don't know
what's gonna happen.

841
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:17,830
I'm not set up to leave,

842
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:20,067
and if something
came back again,

843
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:22,435
I don't really know
where I would go.

844
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,922
After what
that family's been through,

845
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:27,340
I can understand
why Mark's still worried.

846
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,011
But it sounds like
they've taken the right steps

847
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:31,146
to cleanse their home.

848
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,512
So at this point,

849
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:34,783
I'm hopeful things
will get better with time.
