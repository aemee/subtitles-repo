1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,009
There's a lot of anger,
towards the living.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,925
I was thrown to this doorway.

4
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:18,627
It was kind of brutal.

5
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:20,440
Aw, geez.

6
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,871
They're banging on the walls...

7
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:24,894
Wanting to leave.

8
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,659
He went totally
ballistic and killed her.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,780
She's being assaulted.

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,399
I'm not alone inside of my body.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,539
It's really bad in here.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,345
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,622
Something is not right.

14
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:43,726
I see dead people.

15
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,928
This person might have
been a serial killer.

16
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,897
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,256
You get those chills.

18
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,799
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,398
He is darkness. He is evil.

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,302
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:57,988
I think she broke her neck.

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,505
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:03,588
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

24
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,361
You telling me the truth?

25
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:08,408
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,014
I think the Devil is down here.

27
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:11,388
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,072
Who the hell would do this?

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,977
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,093
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:18,559
Until the very end.

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,826
Who is he looking to kill?

33
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:21,792
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:23,882
You need to get out of here right now.

35
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,233
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,834
It was like endless darkness.

37
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,593
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

38
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:51,719
I dig into the history of the location,

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,789
and interview witnesses about
their paranormal experiences.

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,203
While Amy deals directly with the dead.

41
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:00,373
I'm in the small town
of Radford, Virginia.

42
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:02,308
It's about an hour outside of Roanoke.

43
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:05,444
Amy and I were called in by
this woman named Marcelle.

44
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:08,260
She saved a huge historical
building from the wrecking ball.

45
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,217
But she says ever since, her life's
been nothing but a living hell.

46
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:16,658
She says Amy and I are her last chance.

47
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:26,258
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

48
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,072
Even though this
building seems abandoned,

49
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:33,973
I still have to cover or remove anything
that could influence her findings.

50
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:40,737
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:56,557
There are a lot of people here...

52
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:59,318
Layers of people.

53
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,561
There's about four women.

54
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:05,359
They don't want to be here
anymore, they want to leave, and...

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
They can't.

56
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:16,882
So, they're all up there, these people.

57
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,209
It's very physical.

58
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,970
I can't breathe.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,386
Marcelle, you sounded really upset on
the phone about what's happening here...

60
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,622
What's going on?

61
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:39,884
We've had people who have seen
apparitions in the building.

62
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:44,505
We have volunteers who have
been picked up and tossed...

63
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,885
Hair pulled.

64
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:50,010
Visitors come in that have
left with scratch marks on them.

65
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:53,626
And seems that the activity
has become more and more.

66
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:56,141
So, with a list like that of
things that are happening here,

67
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:57,161
why would you stay here?

68
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:00,246
For the love of the building.
There's just something about it.

69
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,356
Well, Marcelle, I've got to say, this
is probably one of the biggest buildings

70
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,195
we've ever investigated, how big is it?

71
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,017
It's over 68,000 square feet.

72
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:08,418
Wow. Okay.

73
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,853
What's the story as far as
history goes? What do you know?

74
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:14,847
In the early 1900s,
it became a Sanatorium,

75
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:18,593
and it stayed a
Sanatorium until the 1980s.

76
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:21,695
We'll, you know, looking around,
this is definitely a work in progress.

77
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,396
What are your plans for it?

78
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:28,000
We would love to restore the
building and turn it into a museum...

79
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,334
With history about the Sanatorium.

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,904
And we'd also like to
put a research library in.

81
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,174
Do you do anything with it now? Is it just,
basically, you're in the repair stage?

82
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,578
In order to pay for the repairs,
we've had some conferences here.

83
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,713
We've had a wedding here recently.

84
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,556
We're doing some parties.

85
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:47,019
Okay. What are you hoping we can
do for you with this investigation?

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,022
I'm hoping you can help
us to find a solution.

87
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,004
It's not only a passion in my
heart, we're run by volunteers,

88
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:59,593
and we don't want the people
coming in to be harmed or injured.

89
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,514
Okay.

90
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,881
Living people are not
supposed to be here.

91
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:20,782
Dead people push themselves up against
the walls to get out of their way.

92
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,722
They don't want to be bothered.

93
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,263
They don't like the living.

94
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,924
They're just pissed off and exhausted.

95
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,645
And they feel so, like, tired.

96
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,239
What made you bring me down here?

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,208
This is one of the rooms where I
had one of my first experiences.

98
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,510
One of our volunteers had...

99
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,947
It was like... something
jumped into her.

100
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,416
Okay, so, take me through what happened.

101
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,656
She became, like, in a trance.

102
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:05,340
When she was talking, her words
were all jumbled and garbled,

103
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:07,491
and just was not making sense at all.

104
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,159
Okay, so, how did you get her out of it?

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,530
We pulled out Bible scriptures
and read Bible to her.

106
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,934
Okay, now, did she come
out of it eventually?

107
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,818
Yes. It took a little
over an hour, but she did.

108
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,639
- Do you know this girl personally?
- I do.

109
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,409
Okay, is she on any medication
that would make her demeanor change?

110
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,144
- Nothing like that?
- No, not at all.

111
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,512
Anything else down here?

112
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,114
A woman screamed at me.

113
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,015
Kind of like I'd startled her.

114
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,351
You sure it wasn't somebody
playing games in here?

115
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,200
There's no way.

116
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,525
And you weren't open for any
kind of business or anything?

117
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:40,286
No, we were not.

118
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,264
There's, like, a woman
running up to me, screaming.

119
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,199
She's freaking out.

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,260
She just says that...

121
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:54,938
It's time to go.

122
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,340
And she's panicked.

123
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,709
A living person would feel this...

124
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,530
This, like, panic.

125
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,019
You feel like...

126
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,334
Something really bad is going to happen.

127
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:12,235
You feel like you need to leave.

128
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,865
I didn't expect to see
a bowling alley in here.

129
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:25,168
Was this used by the patients or was
this for the people that worked here?

130
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,938
Primarily, it was used as reward
for good behavior from the patients.

131
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,751
They were allowed to
come down here and bowl.

132
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:32,617
All right. So, why'd
you bring me down here?

133
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,133
Well, I had my first
paranormal experience in here.

134
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,615
Okay, what happened?

135
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,825
I had this large, white mist
come through the door behind you,

136
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,393
and go down the bowling alley...

137
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:46,689
And then make a hard right
turn and go through the wall.

138
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,725
What was odd... is the
temperature dropped.

139
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,493
Okay, anything else?

140
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:54,364
My most horrifying experience
happened just next to the file room.

141
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:59,335
I got very dizzy, short of breath,
went to the emergency medical area.

142
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,236
Come to find out, it was my pacemaker.

143
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:04,923
It went haywire and was
beating at 143 beats a minute.

144
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:05,814
Wow.

145
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:08,578
And my blood pressure was 164 over 112.

146
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,631
Now, Don, did the doctors ever come up
with an explanation as to what happened?

147
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,680
No, they couldn't
even tell me one thing.

148
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:19,661
There was nothing to
show what happened at all.

149
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:26,526
Do you think people could live here?

150
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:27,838
No.

151
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,959
I wouldn't live here.

152
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,514
- I don't think it's healthy.
- What would happen?

153
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:37,475
I think that they would get sick.

154
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,677
Just let the dead have it.

155
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:44,808
I just don't think living
people should be here.

156
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,589
It's probably not a good idea.

157
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,036
So, Chuck, I was talking to Marcelle.

158
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:13,405
- You're the head of Security here?
- Yes, Sir.

159
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,407
You're probably law
enforcement, I assume?

160
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,276
- I'm a retired deputy Sheriff.
- Okay.

161
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,598
Have you ever had any
experiences yourself?

162
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,615
Oh, yes, Sir, I had one right here.

163
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:29,321
Standing on this lower step one
night, I felt myself levitate.

164
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:34,293
It was like I just became
weightless and started coming up...

165
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,485
And thrown...

166
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:39,546
Over to this doorway.

167
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,795
I could just feel like
something gripped me, okay?

168
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:43,665
Okay.

169
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:49,566
And had a hold of me to the point
that I had no control over my body.

170
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,866
I've got to tell you, Chuck, if
you weren't prior law enforcement,

171
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,482
that's not a story I would
probably believe right away.

172
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:59,563
Well, I can totally understand that.

173
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:07,650
They don't really want
us to be back here.

174
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,891
Because this is their...

175
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:14,005
Quiet area.

176
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,200
I see...

177
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,861
This man, and he's getting...

178
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,439
A little frustrated.

179
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,321
He's like their protector
for the dead here.

180
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:36,222
And I think he's trying to set up, like,
a safe zone, or something, for them.

181
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:43,292
He says he's going to make me sick.

182
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,173
If I don't leave.

183
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,874
Now, did anything else like
that ever happen to you?

184
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,760
Yes, Sir.

185
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,497
I left our gift shop area.

186
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:58,634
There's some steps that will
bring you up to this first level.

187
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:02,595
As I got about the sixth stair...

188
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,154
I could see something standing there.

189
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:07,857
I could see, like, the chest of it.

190
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:08,782
Okay.

191
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:12,870
You can see the muscles
just rippling through there.

192
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:17,551
As soon as I saw that,
I was picked up...

193
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,324
And not thrown straight back.

194
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:24,705
But I was thrown over, like, the rails.

195
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:28,098
Whatever it was had to be strong.

196
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:31,139
Okay, did you get hurt?
I mean, that's a big fall.

197
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,590
It just really shook me up.

198
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,700
Felt like a bear got a hold of me.

199
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,905
- Okay.
- Just that much strength.

200
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,112
How do you wrap your head
around what's going on here?

201
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,476
I couldn't even fathom
what this thing is.

202
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,397
Okay.

203
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:49,925
I don't even know what
that guy's capable of.

204
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:54,417
But I think he's pretty
capable of quite a bit.

205
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:56,289
Did you see him at all?

206
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,218
He does project himself.

207
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:01,099
He is white, tall.

208
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,810
And feels very young. But
he's not, he's very old.

209
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,432
And he's not happy.

210
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:16,113
He doesn't not want
me to talk about him.

211
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,353
So, Chuck, why'd you bring me down here?

212
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:31,254
When I come in this room, I have
seen one face on several occasions.

213
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,760
Describe it to me.

214
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:36,231
- His face is very round.
- Okay.

215
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:38,833
I'd say that he would
have been a big man.

216
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,104
Okay, does it looks like he

217
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,904
knows you're looking at him or
like he's looking at anybody else?

218
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:46,844
Oh, he definitely knows
you're looking at him.

219
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,429
Anything else happen?

220
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,733
One lady during an investigation.

221
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,869
She was hit between the breastbone.

222
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,543
She was hit so hard
that it left a bruise,

223
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,642
and they told us the bruise
was there for almost two weeks.

224
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:05,220
Okay, so, when you say an investigation,
we talking about, like, a paranormal group?

225
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,644
Paranormal group, Sir.

226
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,282
Any other thing, physical, happen here?

227
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:12,587
Women have been touched inappropriately.

228
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:17,508
They find, usually, the woman
who has the weakest emotions.

229
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:18,396
Okay.

230
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,950
And they just start
there and just drain them.

231
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:28,851
And for that reason, we don't allow
any women in this room by themselves.

232
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,910
Whatever's in here has just...

233
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,751
Got something out for the women.

234
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:42,715
So, now I'm seeing there's this new
guy, who tells me to call him Uncle.

235
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,983
He...

236
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:46,892
Likes it down here.

237
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,525
He's a big guy.

238
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,270
He's pervy.

239
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,755
He likes to touch women's hair.

240
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:59,656
I suspect, like, it doesn't just stop
with the hair, you know what I mean?

241
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,079
And there are people...

242
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,582
Maybe four...

243
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:12,445
That are banging inside.

244
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,445
And they want out.

245
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:19,859
This dude... the Uncle dude
trapped all their asses in there.

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,783
It has something to do with money, like,

247
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:26,821
if he keeps them in there,
he'll get more money.

248
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:30,602
He's flooded this place with...

249
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,606
Just nastiness.

250
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,590
Marcelle told me that St.
Albans used to be a Sanatorium.

251
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:56,960
Now, that seemed like a pretty good
place to start my investigation.

252
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,526
So I reached out to a local
psychiatrist who tells me

253
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:05,287
that a lot of sick people
lived and died on the property.

254
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,669
So, the current owner
of the property I'm

255
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,412
investigating told me that
it had been a Sanatorium.

256
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,514
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

257
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:21,784
It actually started out in the early
1900s as St. Albans school for boys.

258
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:22,612
Okay.

259
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:28,513
That closed in 1911, and Dr. John
C. King, with his own funds...

260
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,702
Bought the facility and opened
it up, then, as a Sanatorium,

261
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:36,332
or a freestanding private
psychiatric hospital.

262
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,801
What kind of patients
would have been there?

263
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:43,419
Anyone from people that might
have just exhaustion from overwork,

264
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,299
all the way through some of
our severe psychiatric illness

265
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,500
such as Schizophrenia, manic psychosis.

266
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:58,726
So many different...

267
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,322
People.

268
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,831
- What do you mean?
- I'm seeing, like, people dressed...

269
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,611
In suits and [Bleep].

270
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:10,195
Like, professional people.

271
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:15,017
Some guy is saying something,
like, about emotional trauma.

272
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:18,354
He's like, I suffered emotional trauma.

273
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,295
He's very dramatic.

274
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,595
Walking from room to room, I keep seeing
all of these different dead people.

275
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:31,034
Some are depressed, some are angry,
and they're all trying to speak to me.

276
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,738
There's so much commotion and movement.

277
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:38,519
They're banging on the walls...

278
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:44,516
Wanting to leave, wanting
to leave, wanting to leave.

279
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,730
There's some, like, little
old lady, and she's like...

280
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:55,719
Oh, you know, it's a processing plant.

281
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,020
They process you.

282
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,266
And then the guy says...

283
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:06,427
Oh, don't talk to them,
they're [Bleep] lunatics.

284
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,679
So, with these types of patients there,

285
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,428
what kind of treatments
would they have had?

286
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,427
It could have been anything
from cold, wet wraps, all the way

287
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,941
to things more evocative and
potentially more powerful as well.

288
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:20,853
Such as psychosurgery including
lobotomies, Insulin coma therapy,

289
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,870
electroconvulsive therapy.

290
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,291
Now, is that the same
as electroshock therapy?

291
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,443
Yes.

292
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,769
So many were done at St.
Albans during a stretch of time,

293
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,017
they actually had one machine
that they called Mighty Mouse.

294
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,547
And they would just wheel
it from room to room.

295
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:40,466
It was kind of brutal to have done
because no general anesthesia was offered.

296
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:43,544
And so you would be fully awake
when you were administered an

297
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:48,623
electrical current that would
induce a fairly significant seizure.

298
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:50,557
I mean, it had to be pretty painful.

299
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,632
I actually have a film
I'd like to show you

300
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:57,553
to give you an idea of
just how it was done.

301
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,218
Oh, geez.

302
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:15,009
My feet, my hands.

303
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:18,143
It's like burning. I
feel like I'm burning.

304
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,344
I'm, like, shaking.

305
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,565
It hurts.

306
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,891
There is a female.

307
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:27,683
She's scared. Very,
very, very frightened.

308
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:32,484
She's shaking. She
feels like she's burning.

309
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,590
Now, Doctor, this place
is 68,000 square feet.

310
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:39,556
So, how many patients
would have been in there?

311
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,009
Thousands over the years.

312
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,938
Now, a place that big,
with that many patients,

313
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,065
I got to assume there had
to be a lot of deaths there.

314
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,520
You know, I think so, too. I
was able to find 10, for sure.

315
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:51,948
But I think that would be
a gross underrepresentation

316
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:55,903
of the deaths that likely
would have happened.

317
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:58,072
Now, did they have a Morgue there?

318
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,340
- Yes.
- Really?

319
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,106
So, Doctor, I got to assume there
had to be a lot more deaths there,

320
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,966
because you don't build
a Morgue for 10 people.

321
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:09,067
- That's right, you would not. Absolutely.
- Okay.

322
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,372
I see a group of people
sleeping on the floor here.

323
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:21,753
It's just, like, a big heap of people.

324
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,759
They're kind of covered up.

325
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,700
Like, it's a mess.

326
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,231
Dr. Scheiderer told me that St.
Albans was an all-boys school.

327
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:51,682
Now, it didn't sound like much to me until
I called a local historian to check it out.

328
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,999
He told me that the story
of the school's founder

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,140
will definitely help my investigation.

330
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,433
The school was actually started
by Professor George Miles.

331
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:12,509
He was an educator, a
well-connected businessman.

332
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,183
And he was also a wealthy individual...
he had married into a wealthy family.

333
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:19,037
Okay, so, what purpose
did he open it for?

334
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,473
It was a preparatory school for boys.

335
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:26,846
Here's actually an advertisement
from 1892 when he opened the school.

336
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,788
The idea was to train these
young men to be good gentlemen,

337
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,321
and also to prepare them for
a track to go to university.

338
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,556
Okay, now, what kind of guy was he?

339
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,258
That depends on who you ask.

340
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,308
He had this reputation of being
respectable and dedicated to his work.

341
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,900
But he was also scheming and abrasive.

342
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,000
Really?

343
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:50,805
Now, what happened to the school, because
I understand it became a Sanatorium?

344
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:55,638
Yeah, his business interests took
him away from the school in 1902.

345
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:59,449
- And it kind of floundered without him.
- Okay.

346
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,953
And in 1904, they shut it down.

347
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:04,685
All right. So, what
winds up happening to him?

348
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:08,658
Professor Miles actually
met a pretty tragic end.

349
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,139
Early in 1905, he admitted
himself into a hospital,

350
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,996
and they found that he had liver cancer.

351
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:18,305
And within two months, he passed away.

352
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:22,446
- He was only 42 years old.
- Okay.

353
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:27,575
I'm seeing the man who
calls himself Uncle.

354
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:31,969
And he was in charge...
very, very, wealthy.

355
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,986
And he was the start...

356
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:37,147
Of this.

357
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:44,642
And at first, there was good intention.

358
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:48,698
And then it went bad.

359
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:51,366
Can you describe him?

360
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,709
He's probably in his 40s.

361
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,054
He's bald and he's pale.

362
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,455
He's dying.

363
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:03,176
He feels guilty.

364
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,711
Now that I know my client's property
used to be a prep school and a Sanatorium,

365
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,187
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

366
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:17,081
So I hit the books at the local library.

367
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:22,802
Digging through old records, I discovered
the murder of a girl name Gina Hall.

368
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:28,563
Turns out, her car was last
seen near Marcelle's property.

369
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,992
So, I'm headed over to meet
with a local police Lieutenant.

370
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:34,088
Who says that the
connection between that case

371
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:38,709
and St. Albans runs
much deeper than that.

372
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,914
Lieutenant, I came across an article
talking about a homicide that happened

373
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:50,698
that has a connection to the
property I'm investigating.

374
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,156
What can you tell me about it?

375
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:57,557
On June 28, 1980, Gina
Renee Hall, age 18 years old.

376
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,388
Wanted to go dancing
at a club in Blacksburg,

377
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:04,044
and met a guy named
Stephen Epperly, age 28.

378
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:06,396
And he ended up talking
her into going back to a

379
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,750
lake house that his
friend was taking care of.

380
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:13,170
Okay. What did the original
investigators theorize happened?

381
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:19,071
That Epperly made some advances toward
her, and she rejected those advances.

382
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:33,925
There was something
with a female in here.

383
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:37,729
And there's, like, an older man.

384
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,630
She's kind of being messed with.

385
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:46,537
I mean, I think he was trying to
kiss her or something, and then...

386
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,998
It went bad.

387
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:55,447
We believe that he just went
totally ballistic and killed her.

388
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:59,077
And put her body in the
trunk of her own car.

389
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:01,615
Drove her somewhere,
disposed of the body,

390
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:06,043
and parked the car just down from where
you're investigating with the trunk open.

391
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,324
Wow.

392
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:10,520
What do we know about this guy
himself? I mean, what's his background?

393
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:16,421
Epperly was a charmer to the ladies
thought very highly of himself.

394
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,248
He was known to have
a very violent temper.

395
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:23,622
And was actually charged
previously, before this happened,

396
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:25,779
with a couple rapes in the community.

397
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,123
You're kidding.

398
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:30,480
So, he had all the characteristics of
a guy that would do something like this.

399
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:32,341
Yes.

400
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:39,725
First it was, like, teasing,
then it wasn't teasing.

401
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:46,196
He got... he got mad real quick.

402
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:49,617
And he, like, punches her.

403
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:54,212
She's being...

404
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,191
Kind of assaulted.

405
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,947
He get's life in prison,
first-degree murder.

406
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,326
Now, what about the body?
Was it ever recovered?

407
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,127
No.

408
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:13,431
First case in Virginia that someone was
convicted without ever finding the body.

409
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,219
Wow. Where do you
think the body might be?

410
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,634
Some believe that it may be at the lake.

411
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:24,334
And some people believe that she's buried
on the property you're investigating.

412
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:27,884
The rumor was that he worked at
St. Albans for a little while.

413
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:29,925
Really?

414
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,944
There's, uh...

415
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:36,075
Something really, really wrong.

416
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,996
Um...

417
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:46,327
I'm not alone inside of my body.

418
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,320
As I'm seeing this brutal
attack, I feel a woman jump me.

419
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,201
She's entered my body.

420
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:54,943
Whoa.

421
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,259
Mm. That does not feel good. [Bleep]!

422
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,830
And she's not the only one here
who can do this to living people.

423
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:06,034
Hm-mnh, no. Hm-mnh. Hm-mnh, no.

424
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:10,839
For one of the few times in
my life, I can't finish a walk.

425
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,631
This woman refuses to leave my
body, and I fear for my own safety.

426
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:17,779
Are you okay?

427
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,380
No. She won't [Bleep] leave.

428
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,958
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

429
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:55,383
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other, and our clients, for the first time.

430
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,452
Amy, I'd like you to meet Marcelle.

431
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,888
Few years back, she saved this
building from a wrecking ball.

432
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:03,424
Her dream is actually to
turn this place into a museum.

433
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:04,726
Hmm.

434
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,106
The problem is the
activity here is so bad,

435
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:10,398
she's afraid for any guests or
any volunteers that work here.

436
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:13,067
Now, speaking of
volunteers, this is Chuck.

437
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:17,305
He's retired Police Officer.
He runs the Security here.

438
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:21,242
He's been through some stuff
I've never even heard before.

439
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:23,449
Marcelle wants to know if
there's any way that she can

440
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,894
safely turn this place into a museum.

441
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,576
So, now that Amy
understands why we're here,

442
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:33,253
I'm going to ask her to
tell us about her walk.

443
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,112
I...

444
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:38,378
Got here, and it was very confusing.

445
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:44,259
And I got just layers and
layers and layers of dead people.

446
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:49,271
I got that a lot of the
dead are extremely angry.

447
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:55,172
Pissed off, and exhausted, and that a
lot of them do not care for the living.

448
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:58,779
There was one location
that I went to upstairs.

449
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,350
The dead said that it was their quiet
area and they didn't want me there.

450
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,122
The person that I encountered...

451
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:09,712
He basically was this
group of people's leader.

452
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:14,393
And he is trying to
enforce a safety zone.

453
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,084
For some of the dead here.

454
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:19,521
He was kind of white-ish and tall,

455
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:24,704
and he was projecting himself as
being younger than he actually is.

456
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:28,340
And he told me, you better
leave or I'm going to hurt you.

457
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:33,446
He definitely has the capability
of doing whatever he wants.

458
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:38,585
Could that person, that's that advanced,
take a man that size and throw him?

459
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,806
Um, yeah.

460
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:45,148
I was asked to meet someone
at the grand staircase.

461
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:49,169
As I was on about the sixth step.

462
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,550
Something grabbed me...

463
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,559
And threw me over...

464
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,805
- The rail.
- Whoa.

465
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:01,327
Describe what you saw.

466
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:03,683
The chest... huge.

467
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:07,725
- Like something's on steroids, okay?
- Mm hmm, okay.

468
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:11,083
I can see the muscles,
like he's very ripped.

469
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,613
- Mm hmm.
- Does that make sense to you?

470
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:16,254
Yes, absolutely.

471
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:21,494
What else did you see on your walk?

472
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,329
I met a lot of strange people.

473
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,525
It was kind of interesting,
because at one point

474
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,882
I was seeing a lot of
professional people.

475
00:29:27,883 --> 00:29:30,145
And it was a weird contrast.

476
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:33,821
Then I ran into this other guy who was
just, like, so out of it and so lost.

477
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:37,144
They were just bashing,
banging on all of the walls.

478
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:41,470
So, then, I saw, like, a
bunch of little old people.

479
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:43,554
And one of the little
old ladies said to me,

480
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:46,196
she's like, yeah, this is
just like a processing plant.

481
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:48,910
And then the guy I was with
turned to me and he goes...

482
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,013
Don't listen to them,
they're all bunch of lunatics.

483
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:57,112
This is easy enough to explain to you, you
could take your pick on who you ran into.

484
00:29:57,113 --> 00:30:01,624
Because this place operated as a
Sanatorium from the early 1900s till 1980.

485
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,905
And it was started by this
gentleman right here...

486
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:07,426
John C. King.

487
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:11,092
They treated people here
from depression to drug abuse,

488
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:14,181
alcohol abuse, up to
full blown Schizophrenia.

489
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,222
Really?

490
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:21,127
Does it make sense to you about why you
ran into all those different... yeah.

491
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:24,291
Now, that's part of your draw,
that this was a Sanatorium,

492
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:27,334
and you're trying to bring back
the whole grandeur of this building.

493
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:29,163
- What it was at one time.
- Yes.

494
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:32,600
Once you come into the
building, you're drawn to it.

495
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:38,501
You just, you want to restore it. You want
to bring it back to its original glory.

496
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,917
So, what else did you see?

497
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:44,279
I, physically, had a
very difficult time.

498
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,082
I felt like my head was being
crushed in, I couldn't breathe.

499
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:51,023
A lot of the people I
encountered were also having pain.

500
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:56,324
There was one young girl that I saw
who was having seizures and vomiting.

501
00:30:56,325 --> 00:31:00,928
Then there was a woman that I met
downstairs who felt like she was burning.

502
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,829
She was also shaking,
and I do think that living

503
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,518
people who spend a lot
of time here would...

504
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,019
Be prone to having
symptoms of illnesses.

505
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,611
Marcelle, this is probably
a good time for you to

506
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:17,470
tell Amy about the incident
with your husband Don.

507
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,280
Don has a pacemaker.

508
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:22,157
It's set to go at 60 beats.

509
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:26,515
And it was racing into
the 130s beats per minutes.

510
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:28,541
The doctors couldn't explain it.

511
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,993
He has problems with his
pacemaker every time he comes in.

512
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:35,237
Now, you've got to know
something about the Sanatorium.

513
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:39,901
Back in the day, it had some pretty
primitive ideas of treatment here.

514
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:42,202
You mentioned somebody who
was shaking, and felt burning,

515
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,839
and all this other stuff,
and this was a woman, right?

516
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,095
They had an instrument
here called Mighty Mouse,

517
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,901
that they'd wheel from room to room
and they did electroshock therapy.

518
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:50,912
Okay.

519
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:53,247
Now, do you think that's what
that woman was going through?

520
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:55,001
Yeah, that I think so.

521
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:59,320
I'm trained in psychology, so I'm very
familiar with electroshock therapy.

522
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,435
And now that I know what
this building used to be,

523
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:05,714
I realize that's what it must feel like.

524
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:10,596
There's a lot of dead
people here who feel trapped.

525
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,787
And they were banging on
the windows because they

526
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,733
want to get out, they want help.

527
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:17,020
I had them sketch that.

528
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:19,556
They were very pale.

529
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:22,437
And extremely thin.

530
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,908
Skeleton-ish.

531
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,370
- Is this what you saw?
- Mm hmm.

532
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,040
And you wanted to come back in here?

533
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,938
You've got more guts than I do.
I wouldn't want to come back in.

534
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,399
Oh, my gosh.

535
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:50,653
- Sad.
- That's amazing. Very sad.

536
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:53,751
Do you think it could have possibly
been patients that were here?

537
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:56,659
Now, I'm thinking yeah, probably.

538
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,880
Very sad.

539
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:02,932
Now, is there any reason
why they're trapped?

540
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,088
Yeah.

541
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,657
So, when I first got here,

542
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:09,275
there was a male...

543
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:12,510
Who was having me call him Uncle.

544
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:16,170
I know he was in charge, he
was very powerful, very wealthy.

545
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:19,650
When he started this, he
started it with good intentions.

546
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,716
And he was very odd-looking himself.

547
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:25,189
He was completely bald.

548
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,254
The other thing with this Uncle
was that he was kind of a pervert.

549
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:34,031
And he really likes to do
things inappropriate to women.

550
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:35,899
Let me ask you a question,
does he touch women?

551
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,901
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

552
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:41,572
Well, explain the boiler room to her.

553
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:45,473
Women who enter, they're drained.

554
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:50,682
Down to the point that
they're just ready to pass out.

555
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:54,625
And there's inappropriate touching...

556
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:57,124
In there as well.

557
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:02,184
And that's the reason we do not
allow women by themselves in there.

558
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:06,270
You know, a lot of things you
said reminds me of the guy that

559
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:11,601
actually built this place in 1892,
the original founder of the building.

560
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,431
Now...

561
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:16,923
This is George Miles now, you mentioned
that he started out with good intentions.

562
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,273
He opened this up as a boys school.

563
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:22,188
And it was basically a
preparatory school for...

564
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:26,805
Um, young men to lead them on
to a good path, so to speak.

565
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:31,297
This guy was well-connected,
knew a lot of influential people.

566
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:35,329
Many people said he was
scheming, ambitious, abrasive.

567
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,826
This is the way they described him.

568
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,827
People thought he was a
little bit money-hungry.

569
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,042
Oh.

570
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:45,268
Now, three years after he left the school,
he got diagnosed with severe liver cancer.

571
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:48,103
He was given early forms of chemotherapy

572
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:50,435
and radiation, and he
lost all of his hair.

573
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:54,756
And he died within a couple of months.

574
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,749
What else did you see?

575
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,812
In the boiler room, when I walked
in there, I saw a male and a female.

576
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:08,057
And it seemed like she
was kind of teasing him.

577
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:12,328
He went in to kiss her. She
wasn't going to let it happen.

578
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:14,630
And then he started hitting her.

579
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,966
And she was screaming and crying.

580
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:21,552
And I believe there was
a rape that followed that.

581
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,543
Do you think the girl that was
raped was killed, that you saw?

582
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,664
Mm, yeah, I think so.

583
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:33,359
Back on June 28, 1980, this girl...

584
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,947
It breaks my heart to
even talk about this story.

585
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:41,271
Her name was Gina Hall.
She was 18 years old.

586
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:45,212
Look at this kid. She's
everybody's daughter.

587
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,730
She went to one of
the clubs here in town.

588
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,669
She ran into a guy, Stephen Epperly.

589
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,470
She went dancing, this guy was
a charmer, good looking guy.

590
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:56,673
He convinces her to drive
him to a friend's lake house.

591
00:35:56,674 --> 00:36:00,994
That's the last time she's ever seen.

592
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:05,189
Here's a picture of him.

593
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,784
The guy in the middle...
this is at his trial.

594
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:10,530
They believe what happened is
she went back to the lake house,

595
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:13,073
he made some sexual advances
that she didn't like...

596
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,593
And he killed her.

597
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:18,194
Probably raped her.

598
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:22,999
Her car that she drove him in was
found literally yards from here.

599
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,335
Her body's never been recovered.

600
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,238
There's two theories as to where she is.

601
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,475
She was either thrown in the water, or
she's buried somewhere on this property.

602
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:33,876
Oh, my God.

603
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,819
Geez.

604
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,919
Pretty impressive walk you already did.

605
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,687
What else did you see?

606
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:49,825
Towards the end of the walk, when I was in
the basement after all that, I got jumped.

607
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:54,096
What happened has only happened a
handful of times as a professional.

608
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:59,997
I couldn't finish the walk because
this woman got inside of me.

609
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:03,440
And how long did it take
you to get rid of her?

610
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:06,362
Maybe, like, six to eight hours.

611
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:08,578
Now, we've done over 50 cases together.

612
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,965
This is the first time I'm hearing
her not being able to finish a walk.

613
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,597
Yeah.

614
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,087
So, she continued to stay with me.

615
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:20,557
We left, I was in the
car crying hysterically.

616
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:26,426
What she told me was that there's a
lot of dead people here who can do this.

617
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:31,804
Uh, that they can do it to
people who are open or closed...

618
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:35,806
Who have abilities, don't,
or they can follow them.

619
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:41,105
And they can influence a person to make
anything from just simple bad decisions to,

620
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:45,314
you know, harming themselves
or harming somebody else.

621
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:47,095
Is it possible...

622
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:50,576
For someone to be jumped...

623
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:56,233
And not realize it and change
their whole demeanor, their whole...

624
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,630
Personality, and change
their relationships?

625
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,632
Absolutely.

626
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:05,353
I think it's changed my life.

627
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

628
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,525
Yeah.

629
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,687
It's just a tough subject to talk about.

630
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:18,368
You're talking about
you or somebody else?

631
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,170
Someone else.

632
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:23,552
Speaking with Marcelle, I feel
she's holding something back.

633
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:26,507
And knowing that her husband,
Don, refused to come to the reveal.

634
00:38:26,508 --> 00:38:29,795
I started putting together why.

635
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:33,120
If they have an ailment, are they
more susceptible to being jumped?

636
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,949
Yes.

637
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,750
I have an idea of who
you're talking about.

638
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,945
I need a few minutes.

639
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,867
If they have an ailment, are they
more susceptible to being jumped?

640
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:13,882
Yes.

641
00:39:13,883 --> 00:39:18,683
I have an idea of who
you're talking about.

642
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:28,073
I need a few minutes, guys. I'm sorry.

643
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:44,627
Guys, I want to apologize for becoming
so emotional a little while ago.

644
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:47,230
I don't know how else to explain it.

645
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:51,395
Since I've become involved in this
building, I've seen people's lives

646
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:55,605
that have kind of changed,
relationships that have changed.

647
00:39:55,606 --> 00:40:00,013
And it's caused some
problems in my own home.

648
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:02,909
Nice people became...

649
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,670
Angry or unhappy.

650
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,110
And, hopefully, you can
give us some answers.

651
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:16,162
You've been hit with a lot of
disturbing information tonight.

652
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,162
But the biggest question
is can you turn this

653
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:21,669
historic building into
a museum and be safe?

654
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:27,010
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

655
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:32,422
This cannot become what you want it.

656
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:35,903
With what's going on here.

657
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:40,209
It's far too dangerous.

658
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,219
As far as what to do here...

659
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,191
Go into the largest room you
have here and do a mass funeral.

660
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:52,812
Get several different
types of holy people.

661
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:55,825
That way you're hitting as
many religions as possible,

662
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:59,511
so that the people who are dead here

663
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:02,838
who feel an affinity for
that religion, they'll go.

664
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:07,777
This has to happen three
times over a one month period.

665
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:13,678
One month later, you're going to have
to have an exorcism of the location...

666
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,362
The entire location.

667
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:20,766
Because unfortunately, you do
have, now, these nasty people.

668
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,537
They're going to jump
people, they've gone bad.

669
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:26,261
- Will that get everybody out of here?
- Yeah.

670
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:29,022
I'm just amazed.

671
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:32,267
We knew there were things going on here.

672
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:34,872
- Yeah.
- You've answered a lot of our questions.

673
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:36,757
The next question is the obvious one...

674
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:39,667
Are you going to
listen to what Amy says?

675
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:42,210
Well, we asked her to come
in to give us the solution,

676
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,549
so I think we need to
follow through on it.

677
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,385
If they don't do it, is
it going to get worse here?

678
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:50,888
Well, I wouldn't come back.

679
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:54,400
She ain't coming back, you've got
problems. I've got news for you.

680
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,767
With all of the dead
inside this location...

681
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:59,464
Marcelle and Chuck have
their work cut out for them.

682
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:02,409
But I'm confident that if
they follow my advice...

683
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:08,310
They'll be able to keep their
guests and employees safe from harm.
