1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,484
I don't know what this
dude's fully capable of.

3
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,259
I have nightmares about this house.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,683
Aah! He's pissed off.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,540
All of their bodies were
burned beyond recognition.

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:24,673
- Wow.
- Hates this person. Hates them.

7
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,789
- I had an exorcism.
- An exorcism?

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,929
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna kill you.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,385
I got to get away from this guy.

10
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:35,255
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:38,181
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,172
Something is not right.

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,421
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:43,408
This person might have
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,426
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,261
You get those chills.

17
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:48,528
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:51,064
He is darkness. He is evil.

19
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,066
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,659
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,101
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:01,470
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,905
You telling me the truth?

24
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:06,040
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,641
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,176
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:10,661
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,745
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,714
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,048
Until the very end.

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,450
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,418
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,721
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:22,888
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:26,489
It was like endless darkness.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,940
Amy and I look into
each case separately.

37
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,200
I interview living witnesses and
dig into the property's history,

38
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,921
looking for dark secrets
buried in the past.

39
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:03,427
While Amy communicates with the dead.

40
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:07,604
I'm in Chicago, Illinois, on my
way to the house of a veteran cop.

41
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,367
Thing is, he didn't call us in.

42
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,284
His daughter, Cristina, did.

43
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,748
She says the activity in the house is
so bad, she's afraid for his safety.

44
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:18,933
But she also says that he's such a tough
guy, he is not gonna leave his home.

45
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:23,374
I'm hoping Amy and I can help him out.

46
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:31,540
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

47
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,174
This home has a lot of
photographs, religious icons,

48
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:39,755
and family heirlooms that
have to be covered or removed.

49
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:46,091
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

50
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,988
I'm seeing this older woman.

51
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,896
She said that somebody opened a door.

52
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:13,262
And also is bringing dead
people home with them.

53
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:16,683
And she wants it to stop.

54
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:21,983
She says...

55
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,975
"I'm not gonna waste any more time because
you're not gonna do anything to help me"...

56
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,524
Just like the others.

57
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,769
Uh...

58
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,014
Ow!

59
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,535
What's wrong?

60
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:51,586
Oh, Cristina, I'm glad I'm here.

61
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:54,420
You sounded a little worried on the
phone about all the stuff happening

62
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:57,354
in the house here, and you're
concerned for your father, I understand.

63
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,242
- Yes.
- But what about you?

64
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,641
I've heard voices, footsteps...

65
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,724
And I have nightmares about this house.

66
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:09,510
I haven't lived here since I
was 18, and they still continue.

67
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,721
Okay, like what?

68
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:15,293
There was a boy, and he was trying
to force me to look at his head.

69
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:18,834
And half his face was gone.

70
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:21,499
Okay, so, you've been having
these dreams for a while.

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,560
For years.

72
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,300
Okay, so my question here is
why are you calling us in now?

73
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,586
My daughter is only 3.

74
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:31,064
And when she's staying
here, she's having...

75
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,142
These kind of bad dreams.

76
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:36,579
Cristina, the first person you mentioned
when we spoke on the phone was your father.

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,244
And you sounded concerned
for him. What's the story?

78
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,396
It's just my Dad and my stepmom,
Lori, here by themselves.

79
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,341
I'm concerned about their safety.

80
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,312
What are you looking
for us to do for you?

81
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:50,083
I'm hoping that my nightmares will stop.

82
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:53,228
That I'll be able to
bring my daughter here,

83
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,989
and that my Dad and Lori will
be okay here by themselves.

84
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:04,605
Ow.

85
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:09,345
So, I look, and there's a guy who...

86
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,166
Came from below...

87
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,490
The house.

88
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:18,941
He was punching me nonstop,
and he's got blood on him,

89
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:22,713
like, dried-up blood, and
he told me I should leave.

90
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:26,134
He's worried or something.

91
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:30,737
Well, right down
there. Right down there.

92
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,007
Mm.

93
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:35,956
This male...

94
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,301
This male...

95
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,001
Hides...

96
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,816
Down in here.

97
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:44,297
He gets up in their space.

98
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:52,081
There's someone standing, staring
at you. You know what I mean?

99
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:04,607
This is the same room you
grew up in having nightmares.

100
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:05,952
Yes, it is.

101
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:08,480
Okay. What have you
experienced in the room?

102
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,397
This is where I've seen the apparition.

103
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,604
Of what?

104
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,973
A woman dressed in white.

105
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:20,320
And she was actually right
here in front of my closet door.

106
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:23,180
- Okay, did you get a look at her face?
- No.

107
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,715
Her back was to me.

108
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:29,753
She was facing the door, and
then, she disappeared into it.

109
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,915
Okay. You sure it wasn't a
dream or anything like that?

110
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,736
I was wide awake.

111
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,652
Oh, interesting.

112
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:50,861
What's going on?

113
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:53,234
- The older woman...
- Mm hmm.

114
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:55,803
From outside likes to...

115
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,198
Hide in the closet.

116
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,619
And pop out like a witch.

117
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,747
Is this something that people see?

118
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,408
Yes. That's why she does it.

119
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,482
So, Mark, obviously, we're here
because your daughter called us in.

120
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,408
Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,829
She's concerned for your
safety, as well as your wife.

122
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,153
You got to be a little bit
worried yourself, I would think.

123
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,583
Very worried.

124
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,448
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

125
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:30,380
A little bit. I know that a doctor lived
here, and he was a T.B. doctor in the area.

126
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,848
- You're a cop.
- Yes.

127
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,983
- And how long you been a cop?
- About 27 years.

128
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm sure you're like me. If you don't
see it or hear it, you don't believe it.

129
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,768
Right.

130
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:42,013
So, that being said, have
you had experiences here?

131
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:43,936
I heard my name be called once.

132
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,861
It sounded like my wife.

133
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,363
It sounded just like her,
like something's mimicking her.

134
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,125
- Was she home?
- No.

135
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:52,493
I jumped up. I grabbed my
gun. I ran down the stairs.

136
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,670
It did sound like
someone was in my home.

137
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:56,445
- And nobody was?
- Nobody was there.

138
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,653
Okay, have you ever experienced
anything else down here?

139
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:02,119
I see what appears to be, like, a
black mass coming up the stairway.

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,883
- Scared the heck out of me.
- It did, huh?

141
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,480
- It's very frustrating.
- Right.

142
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:09,114
It's hard to even accept it because
I can't prove it, and I can't...

143
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:12,775
I really can't understand it.

144
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:22,706
This is his preferred area in here.

145
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,900
Aah! He's pissed off.

146
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:28,270
He's angry. People
definitely see this guy.

147
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,798
Ow.

148
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,073
Aah. He hurts people.

149
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:33,742
Ow!

150
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,743
He's making my head hurt.

151
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:36,911
Yeah.

152
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,449
Ow!

153
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,970
Knock it off.

154
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,925
Okay, Mark, so, why'd you bring me here?

155
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,695
I seen a male apparition
and a female apparition.

156
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,456
Okay, describe the male for me.

157
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:59,664
He had a suit on, I
recall, a tie, and glasses.

158
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,960
- And you mentioned you saw a female, also.
- Yes, I did.

159
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,298
She appeared to be a little older,
had longer hair, it looked gray to me.

160
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,494
- Okay.
- And she was in some sort of dress.

161
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,457
You know, on the phone,
your daughter mentioned

162
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,137
something about inviting
other paranormal groups in.

163
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,540
- We did recently.
- And?

164
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,557
They definitely said that
there is something going on.

165
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,217
Was that the only investigative team or
proactive thing you've done in the house?

166
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:24,482
No. I had an exorcism of the house.

167
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,366
- An exorcism?
- Yes.

168
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,187
After the exorcism, did
anything improve at all?

169
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,721
I don't believe it has.

170
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,441
What are you hoping we can do for you?

171
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:35,616
I know now that my daughter had a
hard time here, she had nightmares.

172
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,536
- Yeah.
- Now I got grandkids.

173
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:43,437
I don't want my grandkids to go
through what my kids went through.

174
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,368
Oh, no.

175
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,494
I got, like, weird, Voodoo,
seance stuff happening here.

176
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,921
Somebody opened a [Bleep] door!

177
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,334
Where dead people come.

178
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:03,453
The old woman, she doesn't
like to come in here anymore.

179
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,883
Because it's too um...

180
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:08,292
Chaotic and hectic for her.

181
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:13,564
And she wants her house back, so
she's getting really desperate.

182
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:18,905
She said she swears to God
she's gonna poison them.

183
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,525
So, Lori, I talked
to your husband, Mark.

184
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,907
- Mm hmm.
- I talked to Cristina...

185
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:50,808
And they explained the experiences they've
had and what's going on in the house.

186
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:54,155
- What about yourself?
- I've had a few strange experiences.

187
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,837
- Okay.
- And...

188
00:10:55,838 --> 00:11:00,508
One of them being one night I
thought Mark was home from work.

189
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,003
- He used to work midnights.
- Okay.

190
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,102
I heard footsteps coming up the stairs.

191
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:06,674
I kind of, like, froze.

192
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:11,210
And I never heard him come towards the
bedroom, so obviously, it wasn't him.

193
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:13,446
- Okay, so, he wasn't home.
- He wasn't home.

194
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,348
What about one of the other kids.

195
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:17,595
It wasn't the other kids.
They were all in bed.

196
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:21,376
So, that really freaked me out.

197
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,753
I see these two men.

198
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,701
Um, they have no skin.

199
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:36,028
They're rotting and they like that.

200
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,698
And they're tricksters.
They're tricksters.

201
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,659
Those two men, they're tricksters.

202
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,948
They look charred.

203
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:53,509
I feel like they got
burned or something.

204
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,917
And I hear roughhousing.

205
00:11:56,918 --> 00:12:01,298
You know, they're banging in the walls.

206
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:06,915
Anything else going on up here?

207
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,251
I don't feel comfortable in the dark.

208
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:10,352
Why?

209
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:15,156
Not too long ago, I went to bed one night,
and all of a sudden, in a sound sleep...

210
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:18,827
I felt hands come up and grab my waist.

211
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,797
And, like, I'm facing Mark,
so it couldn't have been him.

212
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,505
- What did you do?
- I froze.

213
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,953
I kind of, like, put the blankets up,
and I was afraid to move or say anything.

214
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:30,085
Okay, so, you couldn't
mistake it for something else?

215
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,139
No.

216
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,289
Sounds like you were on
pins and needles living here.

217
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,227
Yeah.

218
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,045
Now I'm a little more
nervous of going to bed.

219
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:42,946
If I wake up in the middle of the night,
I'm afraid to, like, open my eyes or move.

220
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,415
Bad.

221
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:54,467
Lots of physical [Bleep]

222
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:57,454
He's like...

223
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:03,205
Beating on somebody in the bed.

224
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:04,819
He hates them.

225
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,904
Ah! Hates this person.

226
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,115
- Hates them.
- Why?

227
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:12,141
They're messing with his stuff.

228
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:14,755
Messing with his life.

229
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:17,825
- And this is a living person?
- Yes.

230
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:23,726
He's, like, up in their ear, and
he's like, I'm gonna kill you.

231
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:28,406
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna kill you.

232
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:32,336
Just as I'm seeing what this
angry man can do to the living,

233
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,664
he turns his attention back on me.

234
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:40,565
He wants me out of this house, and
he has disturbing ways of showing it.

235
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,630
He is a [Bleep]!

236
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,677
[Bleep] Damn it.

237
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,314
I got to get away from this guy.

238
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,156
He's really hurting me.

239
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,813
He's really hurting me.

240
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,414
He's very excited that um...

241
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:03,172
He can jump people or
get inside of people.

242
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:09,535
His energy is extremely
uncomfortable, like terrible, terrible.

243
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:16,756
I got scared because I thought, I don't
know what this dude's fully capable of.

244
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:35,337
Mark told me his house used to be
a doctor's office for T.B. patients.

245
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:38,965
So I made some calls around
town, and his story checks out.

246
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:44,866
But the historian I contacted says there's
a lot more to the story than Mark realizes.

247
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:52,891
So, it turns out that
my client was right,

248
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,537
that the house was occupied
by a doctor at one time.

249
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,271
Yeah, Dr. George Gindele.

250
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,073
Can you tell me a little bit about him?

251
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:02,777
Well, he was a general practice doctor.

252
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:06,891
There wasn't a lot of money in
medicine, and he had, like, 10 children,

253
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,185
so they had to start
various other businesses.

254
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:13,731
They opened up a candy store. They
had a newsstand that they operated.

255
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:16,891
Okay, and he did treat
T.B. patients in the house?

256
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,942
Yes, he did.

257
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:22,169
This guy sounds like he
put a lot on his plate.

258
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,322
He had a house with 10 kids
he was trying to raise...

259
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,166
Yeah.

260
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,909
His own practice,
several other businesses,

261
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,374
plus, he's treating a very
contagious disease in his own home.

262
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:36,195
Right. He must have been
terribly stressed out in his life.

263
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:41,052
That hurt.

264
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:45,313
But I know what he [Bleep]
looks like now to me.

265
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:48,040
Even though the angry
man violently attacked me,

266
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,469
he revealed himself to
me for just a second.

267
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,581
And I was able to get a glimpse
of what he looked like in life.

268
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,603
Very professional field.

269
00:15:56,604 --> 00:16:00,504
Dark-brown hair, average
build, as far as I can tell.

270
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,805
He does have a coat on.

271
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:14,283
He had a very, very
[Bleep] stressful life.

272
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:18,447
Very [Bleep] stressed about work.

273
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:22,186
High stakes. High stakes.

274
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,744
Now, you had mentioned that he
had some tragedy in his life.

275
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:31,829
Yeah. Some years before, a couple of his
sons were going through an apple orchard.

276
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,324
Nearby the property, and this man suddenly
appears, and he starts yelling at them

277
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,935
in German, telling them to
get out of the apple orchard.

278
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:41,293
And he takes out a
shotgun full of buckshot,

279
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,479
and he starts firing them at the kids.

280
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,778
And one of the sons got hit in the leg.

281
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,027
And the oldest son,
George, got hit in the face.

282
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:53,512
And he didn't die, but it
disfigured him horribly.

283
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,130
I've seen shotgun victims before.

284
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,252
How bad was his face?

285
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:01,211
Well, George Jr. was hit 35
times in the face and the neck.

286
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,872
So it was obviously very bad.

287
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,399
You all right?

288
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,540
There's a lot of pain in his head.

289
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,778
He had a destination. There was
some kind of meeting with men.

290
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,679
And then, I see trees around me.

291
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,618
That's when things get sketchy.

292
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,219
But then, he came back here.

293
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:36,625
So, now you got this poor kid
shot in the face. He's disfigured.

294
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,228
- Whatever wound up happening to him?
- It's a tragedy.

295
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:43,009
About eight years later, 1926...

296
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:47,252
The doctor gets a house call, and he
decides to take George out with him.

297
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,592
And it's pretty snowy
for that time of year.

298
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:52,508
And the house call is
around the Des Plaines River.

299
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,920
And the doctor parks his car,
goes off on his house call...

300
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,674
And he leaves young George behind.

301
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,931
George got out of the car
evidently, and he went and he

302
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,814
sat on the edge of the bridge
looking down at the river.

303
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,788
Meantime, Dr. Gindele comes
back, and the kid's missing.

304
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:09,160
He doesn't know what
happened to him so...

305
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:12,926
He goes back home and files
a missing-person report.

306
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:16,806
They finally found his body a
couple weeks later downstream.

307
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:20,568
A few miles from where he had
evidently gone into the river.

308
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,894
Okay. So, did they
have a cause of death?

309
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:27,675
Well, they brought the
body in for an autopsy.

310
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:30,478
And that's the death certificate.

311
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,479
He drowned, and they're
saying it's accidental.

312
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,547
Right.

313
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,667
- This had to devastate him.
- Oh, it had to.

314
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:41,768
And it just broke him
up. It just destroyed him.

315
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,326
This guy, he fell down.

316
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:52,227
He slipped on the ice, and maybe he kind
of snapped a little when... you know?

317
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,301
Because he's not dealing with it.

318
00:18:55,302 --> 00:19:00,072
I think it's just because
his brain is... he's confused.

319
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:04,747
It triggered his pain,
and he got really angry.

320
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,628
Uh, pretty quickly.

321
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,490
I want to know what happened to Dr.
Gindele after the death of his son.

322
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:29,309
For me, the best source of
information is from a family member.

323
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,330
I've managed to track down
one of his descendants,

324
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:36,431
who says the tragedy
destroyed the doctor's life.

325
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,380
Now, Jack, I know you're a
descendant of Dr. Gindele.

326
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:48,312
But what was your actual
relationship to him?

327
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,574
- He was my grandfather.
- Okay.

328
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:55,486
And this is a picture of Dr.
Gindele and his oldest son George.

329
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,100
- This was taken before he was shot?
- Yes.

330
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,882
You know, Jack, one of the reasons
I actually wanted to meet with you

331
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:05,242
is because I wanted to find out what
happened to the doctor after his son died.

332
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:11,143
He had a nervous breakdown, and as a
result, he stopped practicing medicine.

333
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:15,724
My understanding is that Dr.
Gindele was of such a state of mind

334
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:19,690
that he went to live in Oak
Park with one of his sisters.

335
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:24,637
And my Grandmother stayed in
the house with the children.

336
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:27,373
So, he just left them there?

337
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:28,606
Well...

338
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,767
Uh, yes.

339
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:34,692
I got to figure your Grandmother
had it pretty tough then.

340
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,553
Yes.

341
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:40,550
How old was the doctor when he died?

342
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:43,476
- Uh, 75.
- 75, okay.

343
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,589
And how old was your
Grandmother when she passed?

344
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,727
- In her 80s.
- Oh, she was an elderly woman.

345
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,608
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

346
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,239
I feel very tired here.

347
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,963
Just...

348
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,418
Worn out.

349
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,639
Worn out.

350
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:12,279
This might be that old lady.

351
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,517
- Okay.
- But something...

352
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:17,738
Is not...

353
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,596
Right.

354
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:23,077
What are you talking about?

355
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:29,106
Something about their
family, it's broken.

356
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,942
She felt really lonely...

357
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,103
Confused.

358
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:39,516
I don't like it.

359
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:43,357
It's a little [Bleep] unnerving.

360
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,901
I'm at the local library to see what

361
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:55,422
else I can uncover about
my client's property.

362
00:21:55,423 --> 00:22:00,767
Digging through the archives, I discover
that a poor farm operated right next door.

363
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:05,082
And according to the headlines,
the conditions there were terrible.

364
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,843
So I've reached out to a local reporter,

365
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:12,744
who tells me that the tragedies that
took place there are unthinkable.

366
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:23,238
The Cook County poor farm is
one of the dirty secrets...

367
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,434
In Chicago history.

368
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:30,088
The conditions there
were absolutely appalling.

369
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:34,110
This was where they sent people,
basically, to be forgotten.

370
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:39,930
And as you can see from this picture,
this is a fairly large institution.

371
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:43,190
What kind of people would
have been on this poor farm?

372
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,760
Quite a variety. There
were mental patients...

373
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:49,669
There were indigents, and
there were tubercular patients.

374
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,462
Pat, you mentioned on the phone
that there was a tragedy on the farm.

375
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:53,713
What was it?

376
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:58,063
In 1923, the main building
of the mental institution...

377
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:00,817
- Okay.
- Burned down.

378
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:04,898
And at least 17 people were killed.

379
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:08,150
All of their bodies were
burned beyond recognition.

380
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,241
Wow.

381
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:14,942
And as you can see, the
destruction was pretty widespread.

382
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:20,863
As a matter of fact, most of the people
who died there ended up being buried there.

383
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:24,441
You mean people who died there
before and after the fire?

384
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,460
Yes.

385
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:28,686
And what's the estimate of how many people
are actually buried on that property?

386
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,881
Conservatively, 38,000 people.

387
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:33,742
Wow.

388
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:44,135
During my walk, I got a quick glimpse
of the angry man who attacked me.

389
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,571
So I'm meeting with a
sketch artist to draw him.

390
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:50,868
His hair was very thick but cut short.

391
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,133
And kind of a longer chin.

392
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,580
How about his eyes?

393
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,630
Almond-shaped.

394
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:01,897
Next, I described a horrifying
scene in the upstairs bedroom.

395
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:07,798
There's a woman in the bed, and
I saw him, like, beating on her.

396
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:12,746
I'd have his left hand holding her arm.

397
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:17,127
And his right hand in a fist over her.

398
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:26,764
Is this what you saw?

399
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,739
Yes.

400
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,573
Now that Amy and I have
completed our own investigations.

401
00:24:56,574 --> 00:25:01,929
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

402
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,497
Amy, I want you to meet Mark.

403
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:05,932
He's a cop, and he's
been a cop for 27 years.

404
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,436
This is his wife, Lori,
and his daughter, Cristina.

405
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:11,257
Now, Cristina's actually
the one who called us in.

406
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:13,003
But she doesn't live here anymore.

407
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:16,667
Even though she doesn't live here, she's
still getting tormented by nightmares.

408
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:19,087
Now she has a
3- year-old daughter...

409
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,009
Who's having similar dreams, and
she's getting very concerned about it.

410
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,102
These two live here, and they're
being tormented by the activity.

411
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:30,275
And they want to get their life back in
order and make this a safe place to live.

412
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:32,960
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

413
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:35,443
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

414
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,852
So, I encountered two men.

415
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:42,471
And they didn't have any skin.

416
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:47,272
They were kind of like
mushy-looking corpses.

417
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:53,388
They were a little charred
like they had been burned.

418
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:57,636
Upstairs in the hallway in
particular, they like to horse around.

419
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,637
They're kind of acting crazy.

420
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:03,929
You'd hear the scuffling
feet in that hallway.

421
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,518
Now, you guys hear footsteps
all the time upstairs.

422
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,321
- Yeah.
- Correct.

423
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:11,044
I would think it was Mark
coming home from work.

424
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,779
And I would hear footsteps.

425
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,967
Well, this particular night, I
heard the footsteps coming up...

426
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:20,370
And I waited for him, you know,
to come back to, like, the bedroom,

427
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,221
and he never came back,
meaning it wasn't him.

428
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,755
Right.

429
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:27,758
Now, you mentioned these guys
looked like they were burned?

430
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,592
They got burned in a fire.

431
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:34,399
That's interesting you say that because in
the late 1800s, less than a mile from here.

432
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,098
Adjacent to the property was
the Cook County poor farm.

433
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,181
The complex housed poor people...

434
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:46,438
Had an insane asylum on it, and it had
a Sanitarium for Tuberculosis patients.

435
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,913
Wow.

436
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:51,503
1923, the insane asylum
burns down to the ground.

437
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:52,848
Oh.

438
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,310
17 people burn to death.

439
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:55,636
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

440
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:59,957
Now, this is a photo of the aftermath.

441
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,354
People that went there, they died
there, and they were buried there.

442
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,680
Could be as high as 38,000.

443
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:07,454
What?

444
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:08,997
- Right here?
- Right here.

445
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:11,956
Now, do you think these
guys came from that fire?

446
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:13,817
Yes.

447
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,161
What else did you see?

448
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:22,422
I encountered this older woman outside.

449
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:26,045
And she was just spewing hate.

450
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:29,119
She felt very alone and confused.

451
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,204
And was really, really tired.

452
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:36,437
One of the things that
she likes to do is...

453
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:39,161
Come out of the closets.

454
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:42,746
She's trying to assert
her dominance that way.

455
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:46,387
I saw the figure of a woman...

456
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:50,566
Upstairs in my bedroom
facing the closet.

457
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,401
And she disappeared into it.

458
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:56,440
I saw an apparition of a woman.

459
00:27:56,441 --> 00:28:00,026
I could only see her from the back because
she was sitting on the edge of the bed.

460
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:03,659
The edge of the bed is
right next to the closet.

461
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,895
Let me ask. What is she pissed about?

462
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:10,196
She doesn't feel like...

463
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,197
This is her space anymore.

464
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:18,013
Because there was something about
seances and someone opening a door.

465
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:20,943
And she's getting desperate.

466
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:23,717
No one's listening,
and she swears to God,

467
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:26,951
if it continues she
wants to poison you guys.

468
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,699
Like, she wants to poison you.

469
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,456
- They did have a ghost group...
- Okay.

470
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,368
Of paranormal investigators come in.

471
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:38,926
Not only that, but they had a priest
perform an exorcism in the house.

472
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,920
- We did.
- Of the house?

473
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,410
Of the house.

474
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,845
This is where we
started the ritual here.

475
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,448
And he said that he was
chasing whatever it was

476
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:50,435
throughout the house
down into the basement.

477
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,856
While he was in the basement...

478
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,030
He's saying the final prayers and...

479
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:59,448
The stole got pulled off of his
shoulders and thrown to the floor.

480
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,584
Oh!

481
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,453
Now...

482
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:07,861
Is the woman pissed off because of
maybe the exorcism or all of the above?

483
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,879
I think it's all of the above.

484
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,160
I'm a little concerned about your saying
that she was going to poison the people.

485
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,610
- Mm hmm.
- Is she capable of that?

486
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:17,471
Yes.

487
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:20,573
This woman's so advanced she's
able to persuade the living

488
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:25,364
into harming themselves, and
she plans to do it with poison.

489
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,352
I got to protect my family.

490
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:32,701
This is not something that's
gonna obviously fly here.

491
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:35,052
What else did you see?

492
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:37,821
I'm outside, and I meet this guy.

493
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:40,850
He was trying to get me out of here.

494
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:45,402
He just didn't want me to
find anything out about him.

495
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:50,306
Definitely the most powerful
entity that's in this house.

496
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,937
Aah! He's pissed off. He's angry.

497
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,258
People definitely see this guy.

498
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,669
Ow.

499
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,617
Aah. He hurts people.

500
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:01,895
He looked very professional.

501
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,615
He was...

502
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:05,646
Obsessed with his work.

503
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,459
Extremely stressed-out man.

504
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,658
And he was extremely good
at whatever it was he did.

505
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:15,205
But it was high-stress and high stakes.

506
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:19,839
I'm not sure if this is the guy
you saw, but it sounds like him.

507
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,762
This house was occupied by a guy
by the name of Dr. George Gindele.

508
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,797
And he worked out of
the house, this house.

509
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:31,326
Um, starting in, I think, 1920.

510
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,798
He was a workaholic, this guy.

511
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,553
Back during that time period, Chicago
had a big Tuberculosis outbreak.

512
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:43,823
He treated a lot of those
patients right here in the house.

513
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:46,863
And he had 10 kids here.

514
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:49,296
That's a lot of stress.

515
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:55,197
I'm just curious if this could
possibly be the guy you saw.

516
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:04,163
I did do a sketch of him.

517
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,990
Well, you guys take
a look at the sketch.

518
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,089
Wow.

519
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,670
Wow, is right.

520
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:24,165
That's the apparition I saw.

521
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,878
100% definitely, that's the guy I saw.

522
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,701
Oh, my God.

523
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:33,229
If you imagine a mustache right here,
it really does look just like him.

524
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,401
I don't like the fact that...

525
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:38,955
He's here doing what he's doing
because I'd figure if he was a doctor,

526
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:42,736
he would be helping people,
not causing problems.

527
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:44,921
And did you get anything
else from this guy?

528
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:48,100
He had had two big
accidents during his life.

529
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:52,841
The first one I saw
was he slipped on ice.

530
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:58,636
The other one I saw, like, he
was walking to meet some men...

531
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:01,504
And then, something
really, really bad happened.

532
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:06,451
He was all bloody, and there was
something wrong with his eyes.

533
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:10,808
I have nothing that says Dr.
Gindele had any accidents but...

534
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:14,782
There were two events in his
life that basically destroyed him.

535
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:20,683
I actually have a picture of him and
his son, who he was very close to.

536
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:24,692
This is the doctor, and
this is his son, George Jr.

537
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:28,205
George Jr. was about 20 years old, and
he was walking through the neighbor's,

538
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:30,333
farm the apple orchard.

539
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:33,168
And the guy that lived on the
farm decided to take a shot at him.

540
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:34,402
What?

541
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,671
Shot him in the face and neck.

542
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:40,152
So this kid was disfigured.

543
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,830
My dream.

544
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:50,096
I had a nightmare one
night, and there was

545
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:55,129
a boy who looked like
he was in his late teens.

546
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,860
And it looked like he had been shot in the
head because half of his face was missing.

547
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:05,841
And he kept trying to
force me to look at it.

548
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:12,701
Because I have nightmares all the
time that are connected to this house.

549
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,870
I have nightmares all the time
that are connected to this house.

550
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:01,618
This is...

551
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:03,703
Hard for me to take.

552
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:06,625
You guys thought I was crazy.

553
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:11,534
I never even heard that, honey.
I didn't even know that happened.

554
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:13,037
She'll be all right.

555
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:16,398
Hopefully, this helps her.

556
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:26,155
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

557
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:31,589
Starting to make sense to you
now, though, a little? Yeah?

558
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,540
Now, this poor kid, George Jr., was
badly disfigured from this shooting.

559
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,330
Now, you mentioned falling into
the ice or falling on the ice.

560
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:43,531
George Jr., in April of 1926, fell...

561
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:48,238
Accidentally or he jumped
into the Des Plaines River.

562
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,767
And I have his death certificate.

563
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:57,571
Right here basically, you'll see,
it just says accidental drowning.

564
00:34:57,572 --> 00:35:03,077
This eventually destroyed Dr. Gindele
because he gave up his medical practice.

565
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:07,225
He moved out of his house, left
his wife with the nine kids...

566
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,078
What?

567
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,885
Moved in with his sister,
and left her here alone.

568
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:15,125
Now, she stayed here
until she died in 1960.

569
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,892
This is his wife, Julia.

570
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:20,353
Oh, my gosh.

571
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:23,195
Could this be the woman you saw?

572
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:24,257
Yes.

573
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:26,531
Now, could this possibly
be the guy you saw?

574
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:30,192
- I think so.
- Oh, my gosh.

575
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:35,226
The main areas that he likes to be in...

576
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,718
Is the basement and then
the front room upstairs.

577
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,877
Would that be causing her nightmares?

578
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:44,731
I mean, it seems like they're... yeah.

579
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:49,053
With him, you'd experience him in
a lot of, you know, different ways.

580
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:52,767
Anyways, you might hear,
you know, things in your ears

581
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:55,391
making threats, touching people.

582
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:58,998
Most of the stuff he
does is in the dark.

583
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,508
I am very afraid of the dark.

584
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:05,805
And at night, there will be times
where I wake up in my sleep...

585
00:36:05,806 --> 00:36:08,184
And I won't even open my eyes.

586
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:10,553
I'll just pray that I fall back asleep.

587
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:12,056
Why do you wake up?

588
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:15,025
- I don't know why I wake up.
- Huh.

589
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:20,176
I did do another sketch
of something that he does.

590
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:23,912
And it was in the main bedroom.

591
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:29,313
And he was getting physical
with a woman in the bed.

592
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:41,053
Well, I have to show this to you, so...

593
00:36:43,642 --> 00:36:45,689
That's really freaky.

594
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,570
He's touching you.

595
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:51,828
Why don't you just explain
to Amy what you told me?

596
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:56,158
Well, not too long ago, I
was in a sound sleep, and...

597
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,537
I woke up because I felt
somebody grabbing my waist.

598
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:02,205
And I could feel the fingers.

599
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:06,742
But when I woke up, I did open
my eyes, and I was facing Mark.

600
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:09,287
So, my back would have
been towards the closet.

601
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:11,932
So, it couldn't have
been him touching me.

602
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,739
I'm getting angry.

603
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,859
Because this isn't his
house anymore. It's my house.

604
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,948
I'm going to tell you what
I believe is going on here.

605
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:26,727
After hearing everything, I kind of feel
like I was being a little too hard on him.

606
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,492
It's a heartbreaking story.

607
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:33,640
The woman, she's always been
here. I mean, she never left.

608
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:36,576
I think that what...

609
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:39,302
May have happened here is that...

610
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:41,945
He was probably pulled
back to the house.

611
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:45,314
When you had paranormal groups
come in and try to contact the dead.

612
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:50,535
It probably pulled him
back here from the darkness.

613
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,948
This is the place he ran from in life...

614
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:56,837
Too many memories, too much pain.

615
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,575
He's reliving it over
and over and over again.

616
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:06,730
I think he's angry at you
because you called him back here.

617
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:11,051
I think he's lashing out because
he wants to make you suffer, too.

618
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:16,089
He really can't leave now because
he's just in the thick of this chaos.

619
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,894
So, he's not able to leave on
his own, even if he wanted to.

620
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:20,995
Exactly.

621
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:24,695
So, when you saw the accidents
involving the ice and the blood,

622
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:27,534
was that him reliving
his son's accidents?

623
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:30,851
I think so. It's a very, very sad thing.

624
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,582
It is sad, and on the
same... I feel bad for him.

625
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,367
And on the other hand, I'm mad.

626
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,424
- Well, look what he's doing to your wife.
- That's the part I'm mad about.

627
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:42,025
And what he did to my kids.

628
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,160
I know you guys got overwhelmed
with a lot of information tonight,

629
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,016
and I'm sure it's not
what you wanted to hear.

630
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:52,625
But the big question is can you
live here without all the torment?

631
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,835
And can you go on without
having these nightmares

632
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:57,538
and protect your 3-year-old
from having the same issues?

633
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:58,942
I don't have an answer for that,

634
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:03,769
but I'm gonna turn it over to
Amy, and hopefully, she will.

635
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,569
It's going to sound unusual.

636
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,794
The first thing would be to
get a clinical psychologist.

637
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:13,078
Who practices providing therapy.

638
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,913
These are his conditions.

639
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,032
What do you mean his conditions?

640
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,413
- He's asking for this?
- Yes.

641
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:23,074
Earlier, we made a compromise.

642
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:25,524
This actually happens quite often.

643
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:28,890
When I got to the house for the
reveal, the angry man approached me,

644
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:32,453
and we worked out a deal
to help him to move on.

645
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,787
He needs to focus...

646
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,925
He needs to focus...

647
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:38,268
On talking out his life.

648
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,889
On talking out his life.

649
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,609
Because right now he's living in chaos.

650
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,903
So, we want to give him a
little bit of time to process.

651
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:50,627
And hopefully, he'll just
leave after that anyways.

652
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:54,820
The second thing is you need
to bring in a chaos magician.

653
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,613
What the hell exactly
is a chaos magician?

654
00:39:57,614 --> 00:40:01,583
A chaos magician is an individual who...

655
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:05,184
Follows the philosophy that...

656
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:09,685
The Universe and the Earth and
everything is functioning within chaos.

657
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:12,805
So they utilize that
chaos within their magic.

658
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:16,055
So, when the chaos magician comes
in, that'll get rid of the old lady,

659
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:20,778
the two burn victims, and Dr. Gindele,
too, if he doesn't leave on his own?

660
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:21,938
Yes.

661
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:24,280
What of Cristina's nightmares at home?

662
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:26,820
Because she's having them
not here but at her house.

663
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:28,423
Right.

664
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:31,049
How do we fix that, or can it be fixed?

665
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:35,505
When you wake up, you need to
tell them, you get out of my house.

666
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:38,508
You leave me alone. You
leave my daughter alone.

667
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:40,762
Will it affect her daughter?

668
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:43,679
Well, that remains to be seen.

669
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,309
- She's only having stuff here, right?
- Right, yeah.

670
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,287
Yeah. So, you know, they're
gonna do all these steps,

671
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:50,906
and the house is gonna be locked down.

672
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,191
So, then, she'll be
fine to come over here.

673
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:54,659
Are you gonna do what Amy suggests?

674
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,794
I'll do my best, but that
psychologist isn't for us.

675
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:58,696
I got enough people in the house.

676
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:01,299
Even if we do the other
steps, he'll have to leave.

677
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,571
We'll force him to leave.

678
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:06,703
- Are you seriously gonna do that?
- I don't know.

679
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:10,974
Hey, you got to take some responsibility
here, he did not want to be here.

680
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:13,912
It's just the negotiation part
that I have a problem with.

681
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:19,813
I'm upset, too, you know? This guy
beat the [Bleep] out of me for hours.

682
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:24,631
I think that you should
go with what Amy...

683
00:41:24,645 --> 00:41:25,906
Is saying.

684
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:29,722
And it's just that, you know,
as extreme as it is for Lori,

685
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:34,036
if it gets it all to stop,
then swallow your pride, and...

686
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:38,167
You have to do what you have
to do to get it all to stop.

687
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:40,339
- It's not easy for me.
- Because you're pissed off.

688
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,708
But you know what, two
wrongs don't make right.

689
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,781
I really hope Mark's frustration
doesn't affect his judgment

690
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:49,114
when it comes to following my advice.

691
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:52,300
I believe that if he follows
the steps I've given him...

692
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:58,201
He'll not only be helping his
family but the dead here, too.
