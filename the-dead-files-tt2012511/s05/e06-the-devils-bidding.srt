1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,571
He murdered somebody, and
he's laughing about it.

3
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:16,323
There's something here
that wants me to die.

4
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,325
It seems like a devil.

5
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,069
I refused to believe it.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,631
This thing is the possessor,
people worshiped it.

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,533
This is the worst case I've ever heard.

8
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:29,986
I just want to not be afraid anymore.

9
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,867
It can take souls.

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,688
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,329
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,647
Something is not right.

13
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,855
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:44,045
This person might've
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,830
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,598
You get those chills.

17
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,166
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,435
He is darkness, he is evil.

19
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:54,485
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:56,006
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,708
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:01,987
I'm Steve Dischiavi, I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,415
You telling me the truth?

24
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,337
I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

25
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:08,339
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,619
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,073
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,090
But Steve and I never speak.

29
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,234
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,786
Until the very end.

31
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,096
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,043
Then we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,186
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:23,351
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:26,952
It was like endless darkness.

36
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:46,565
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

37
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:51,960
I interview living witnesses, experts,
and dig through the property's dark past.

38
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,581
While Amy communicates
with the other side.

39
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:01,221
I'm in Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
heading over to see a woman named Jodi.

40
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,275
The activity in her home is so bad,

41
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:06,807
she and her husband are getting
attacked on a daily basis.

42
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:09,754
She wants to sell, but he
wants to stay and fight.

43
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:15,655
She says if Amy and I can't help her
out, she thinks her marriage is done for.

44
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:23,078
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

45
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:28,941
This home has a lot of family photos
that have to be covered or removed.

46
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:34,842
Once they're gone, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

47
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,261
I just see, like, a
woman off in the distance.

48
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:54,002
She has very, like,
Native American features.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,318
I don't think she's well.

50
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,619
She has a lot of anger.

51
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,430
So this woman that I was
talking about earlier...

52
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:16,362
Says that she just wanted
everyone to understand...

53
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:21,500
Like, she didn't betray them or
mean to hurt anyone, but that,

54
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,566
at the same time, they
needed to learn a lesson.

55
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:29,347
She feels like they deserve it.

56
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:38,762
So Jodi, I'm glad I'm here, because
things sounded pretty bad on the phone.

57
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,163
It's rough.

58
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:47,097
It's really rough.

59
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:52,408
Because I feel like
nobody believes me, and...

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,896
You try to tell people, and they
look at you like you're crazy.

61
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,032
Listen, we're here to help, okay?

62
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,162
All right? We're here to help you, so...

63
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:08,173
It's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna see what we can do.

64
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,454
All right?

65
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,778
Okay, so who lives here
with you, your husband?

66
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,780
Just me and my husband.

67
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:18,728
- How long have you guys been here?
- We've lived here since 2004.

68
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,648
I didn't even want
to live in this house.

69
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,137
Okay, why'd you call us now, though?

70
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,318
Because of the attacks.

71
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,431
They are more frequent now.

72
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,531
I'm touched every day...

73
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,209
It's just constant.

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,622
I'm hearing things
throughout the house, I...

75
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:42,143
See shadows...

76
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:45,170
And it's gotten...

77
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:49,285
To the point where I just feel like
I'm being followed everywhere I go.

78
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:51,774
I go take a shower...

79
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:57,370
And it actually feels like somebody
has climbed in the shower with me.

80
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:01,190
I feel like something
has attached itself to me.

81
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:05,226
I worry about what's gonna happen to me.

82
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:08,062
I never know what's gonna
happen from day to day.

83
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:11,003
I just don't know.

84
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:19,479
The Native American woman,
she follows this person around.

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,968
Can you talk about the person she's...

86
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:25,218
- Talking to?
- Um, living person...

87
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,453
Seems to be a female...

88
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,454
Um, probably about...

89
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,815
Forties?

90
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:35,370
I'm not sure what she wants from her.

91
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:39,554
I just know that she is with her a lot.

92
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,885
Because, I mean, I see them,
like, in the kitchen together,

93
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,237
I see them showering
together, I see them...

94
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:47,091
You know, her in the room at night.

95
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:52,012
The dead girl is not
helping the living woman.

96
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:57,451
What's going on in here?

97
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:02,072
I saw an apparition
walk past the doorway.

98
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:05,678
And they were wearing
blue jeans and boots.

99
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,374
So what are we talking about, like
cowboy boots, or like work boots?

100
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,379
They look like work boots.

101
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,501
- Now, was it a man or a woman?
- It was a man.

102
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay, so have you seen
anything else like that?

103
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,419
I've seen, like, a
dark shadow of a figure.

104
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,468
I just see it out of the corner of my
eye, and it's like you turn, and it's gone.

105
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:26,534
Now, let me ask you a question, what
do you think is going on in this house?

106
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:29,608
I feel like there's
something here that...

107
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:32,369
Wants me to die.

108
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,119
The thing that I'm seeing
looks like what's depicted

109
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,232
in the Catholic religion as a devil.

110
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:46,304
To me, it looks like it has
long nails, and evil and [Bleep].

111
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,909
It's saying that it can take
as many souls as it likes.

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,728
Like, I'm like, "what are you?"
And he's like, "I am the darkness".

113
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,348
How would people experience him?

114
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,581
It's solid, she's definitely seen it.

115
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,881
Can it hurt people?

116
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:04,468
It's saying it can and it will.

117
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:09,809
It's a trickster, it's a
liar, it's a manipulator.

118
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:22,507
So, Jodi, why'd you bring me in
the basement, what's going on here?

119
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:27,180
I've seen an apparition of
an Indian sitting right there.

120
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,989
Talking about like a
Native American Indian?

121
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,817
Yes. It looked like he was
dressed, like, ready for war.

122
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,271
Okay, are you experiencing
anything else down here?

123
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:38,185
Um, yeah, I hear...

124
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,561
What sounds like...

125
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,388
Hammers...

126
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,619
Boards being moved.

127
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,637
I want to describe it as almost
like somebody working on the house.

128
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:52,103
You have that feeling of uneasiness down
here, I can see it just looking at you.

129
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,097
Yeah, I... don't even
want to be here right now.

130
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,089
Okay, all right, so why
don't we get out of here?

131
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,830
You've spent enough
time down here with me.

132
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,701
One of the things it likes to do is...

133
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,532
That.

134
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:11,154
Yeah, [Bleep] Around with the doors.

135
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:15,295
I think this thing is the possessor.

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,308
The thing says that, you
know, people worshiped it.

137
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,177
The Native Americans, they
would allow it inside of them

138
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:27,878
to do things because that
was the way to keep the peace.

139
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:35,782
I think it would oftentimes
kill the person it possessed.

140
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,127
Okay, Jodi, so what's going on up here?

141
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:49,198
As soon as I turn my light off to try
to close my eyes and go to sleep...

142
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:52,078
That's when it gets worse.

143
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,434
Are you getting
physically touched up here?

144
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:59,036
I've had some stuff
happen to me up here.

145
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:02,294
Like, almost like somebody's...

146
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:06,129
Trying to wake me up in
an arousal kind of way.

147
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,514
Okay.

148
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:13,415
And you toss, you turn, you move, you...
you know, you say, "get away from me"...

149
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:18,857
And before you know it, something
is over me that you can't see.

150
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,858
- Okay.
- And I was, um...

151
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,019
Attacked.

152
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,155
Sexually.

153
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,142
Have you told anybody this?

154
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:33,634
I tried to tell my husband about it,
and I don't feel like he believes...

155
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,936
What happened to me.

156
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:40,317
Um, it's just real hard to talk about.

157
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:46,362
I imagine that's gotta be the most horrific
thing for a woman to have to deal with.

158
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:50,488
When I was a young girl,
I was sexually assaulted.

159
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,489
How old were you when this happened?

160
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,330
Um... I was about 12 years old.

161
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:59,246
Okay, look at me, okay?

162
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:05,147
So you can trust me, alright I'm listening
to everything you're telling me, okay?

163
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,266
I just want it to end,
I just want to not...

164
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:12,210
Be afraid in my own house anymore.

165
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,959
It's so hard, because I spend so
much time in this house, alone.

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,385
I'm gonna make this okay, all
right? Come here, I promise.

167
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,996
I'm gonna make this right,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

168
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,957
- Mm hm.
- Don't worry about it.

169
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,849
I think it can do vile things.

170
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,632
- Like what?
- Inappropriate...

171
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,104
Sexual things, sometimes.

172
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:41,850
And it's very traumatizing and
scary for this person, as I...

173
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,131
Understand.

174
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,781
I hear somebody in this room, a female.

175
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:56,819
She's mad, she's very
angry, she feels attacked.

176
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,965
She's being messed with
by the... uh, the thing.

177
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,530
It's found her secrets, and it's like...

178
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:07,043
Messing with her mind through
her secrets or something.

179
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:11,686
And she's like, can't take
it anymore, she's like...

180
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,317
She's very stressed out.

181
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,738
I feel like it's saying, like,
"you know I'm a part of you,

182
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:22,079
you know you're a part
of me, I'm gonna get you".

183
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,216
She's very stressed out.

184
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,848
I feel like it's saying, like,
"you know I'm a part of you,

185
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:43,189
you know you're a part
of me, I'm gonna get you".

186
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:47,825
So it's mentally abusing her, I guess.

187
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:51,366
Is this thing targeting her?

188
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:53,788
Yes, it is.

189
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,226
Patrick, let me ask you a question,
do you know any history of the house?

190
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:07,413
A little bit, I did read
a few things about some...

191
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:10,897
The American Indians in this area.

192
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,581
There was a lot of fighting
with other tribes in this...

193
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:17,069
This particular valley.

194
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,211
- So Patrick, I talked to your wife, Jodi.
- Mm.

195
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:25,252
And I've done a lot of
these cases, and she...

196
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,859
She's having a tough time here.

197
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,682
I mean, at first, I really...

198
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,511
Didn't believe any of it,
I refused to believe it.

199
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:36,282
Are you still refusing to believe it?

200
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,803
Um, I can't.

201
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,830
What do you mean you can't?

202
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,977
Me and Jodi was in the
living room talking, and...

203
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,927
We decided to turn the TV off.

204
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,616
So when I turned it off...

205
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:55,537
I saw a man sitting on
the arm of her chair.

206
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,072
And I told her, I said,
"Jodi, do you see this?"

207
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:00,354
She says, "what?" I
said, "look in the TV".

208
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,653
And I looked over at her, and
I looked back, it was gone.

209
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,568
There was nothing there,
just her reflection.

210
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,570
What'd he look like?

211
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:09,340
He had... I want to
call it a farmer's hat.

212
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,764
It looked like he had a beard.

213
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:15,776
He looked angry, and it scared me.

214
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:18,802
So what you're telling me is that
you're not a skeptic of what's

215
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:21,289
going on, you believe there's
something going on in your house.

216
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,221
Yeah, I know there's
something going on here.

217
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,326
But yet at the same time,
your wife seems to think

218
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,225
you're not believing
anything she's telling you.

219
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,522
- When Jodi was attacked...
- Right.

220
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:32,106
And I came home...

221
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,387
She was...

222
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:36,635
In, I would say, a state of shock,

223
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:40,579
I mean, she was just white as a ghost,
she was trembling, she was upset.

224
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,708
Well, I went off, and
I called 'em all out.

225
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,312
I said, "look, if you're this bad
and you're this tough, show yourself".

226
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:49,750
Okay, so what happened?

227
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:54,251
I woke up with bruises on my lower back.

228
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,662
And I can't figure out what he is.

229
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:11,563
It seems like he keeps that form,
like, that look of, like, a devil.

230
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:18,091
He also likes to make
people feel trapped.

231
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,327
I don't know, like, he's up in the...

232
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,548
Up, up...

233
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:47,121
He's saying, like, he
murdered somebody or something.

234
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:50,662
And he's laughing about it.

235
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,945
My main concern right now is my wife.

236
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,182
She sobbed when I
spoke with her, sobbed.

237
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:01,741
I can't give her answers,
and she keeps asking me,

238
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,744
and, you know, when I can't
answer, what do you do?

239
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:09,050
- Right.
- That's why I spend so much time out here.

240
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:11,709
It's breaking my heart,
the both of you, I mean,

241
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,416
it sounds like you two
aren't communicating.

242
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,901
You want to help, you
just don't know how.

243
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:22,063
It's went downhill, it's went
downhill fast, faster than we want.

244
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,671
But we don't know what to do to fix it.

245
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:26,907
She's concerned that the
house is gonna kill her.

246
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,768
Wow.

247
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:33,950
She's been attacked, and attacked in
ways that nobody should be attacked.

248
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:38,155
I think it wants... whatever
it is wants to hurt her again.

249
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,081
Like I said, I'm not...

250
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:44,861
I don't want to say dead, because I
don't want to see that happen, but...

251
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:50,762
This is the worst case I've ever
heard as far as paranormal stuff.

252
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,670
- Can we take a break?
- Yeah, absolutely.

253
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:57,511
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

254
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:39,192
Patrick told me there were some violent
Native American wars on his property.

255
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:42,094
Now, most times client leads
turn out to be a dead end,

256
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:44,389
but this one I want to check out.

257
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,248
I've reached out to a
local historian to see

258
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,929
if there's any truth
to what Patrick said.

259
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:59,776
So my client told me that the land
I'm investigating, where his house is,

260
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:02,636
at one time there was warring
Native Americans, is that correct?

261
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,351
That's correct.

262
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:08,067
There was a treaty signed in 1768.

263
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:13,269
And that delineated Native American
property from white settler property.

264
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,780
But the white settlers didn't
always obey those guidelines,

265
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:21,441
and so they were squatting
on Native American property.

266
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,357
And that includes the
property I'm investigating?

267
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,024
- That's right.
- Okay.

268
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,159
Well, the Senecas went on a rampage.

269
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,862
In part because the British had
prompted them, they had given them guns,

270
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,083
they had given them ammunition.

271
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:40,038
And the Native Americans
began these attacks to

272
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,421
antagonize the white settlers
to move them off the property.

273
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:48,128
How many white settlers did get
killed during these conflicts?

274
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:50,993
There are at least 370 documented.

275
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:52,638
Now who was in charge of these guys?

276
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,659
They were led by Chief Cornplanter.

277
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,233
He was a very peaceful man.

278
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:02,236
He didn't sound so peaceful
after what you just told me.

279
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:05,541
I think, perhaps, he
was a reluctant warrior.

280
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,569
He loved his nation, he
loved his tribe, and so...

281
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,470
He decided to go along, of course, with
the majority, and the majority ruled.

282
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,322
So now I'm seeing this guy.

283
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,153
I think it's a Native American.

284
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:28,074
Um...

285
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:32,227
He has feathers in his hair.

286
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,310
I think he feels guilty.

287
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:46,243
There's only so much that you want
to see your enemies fall to revenge.

288
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:50,175
I think he thinks he
needs to make things right.

289
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:52,656
This Native American knows
all about the Devil creature

290
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:54,535
I've been seeing throughout the house.

291
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:57,826
And he's telling me his people
had to deal with it, too.

292
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:02,093
He's saying people
worshiped it, and, um...

293
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:04,794
But not anymore.

294
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:10,723
You know, you have to
do things for this devil.

295
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:15,344
Otherwise, it will do
uncontrollable things.

296
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,142
Now let me ask you a question about
the property I'm investigating.

297
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:22,612
Any of those attacks
happen right on my property?

298
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:26,225
- Well, June 10, 1778...
- Okay.

299
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:30,360
The Plum Tree Massacre, as
it's widely known, occurred.

300
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:32,256
Okay, what happened?

301
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:35,813
There was a wagon-load of 16 settlers,

302
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:39,411
and there were Native
Americans of the Seneca tribe.

303
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,490
They were concealed in
a group of plum trees.

304
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:48,307
And so when the wagon passed through,
the Native Americans attacked.

305
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,909
So 16 settlers go through, and they
get ambushed, were they all killed?

306
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,655
Twelve were massacred... there
were two children who were killed.

307
00:19:55,656 --> 00:20:00,453
Two of the people were women, they
were both scalped and stabbed...

308
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:03,809
Tomahawked, and left for dead.

309
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,708
And two of the girls were kidnapped.

310
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,176
Do you know what happened to them?

311
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,864
I know that they were taken to Canada.

312
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:13,567
I don't know the rest of the story.

313
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,488
Okay.

314
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:22,141
I'm hearing a lot of...

315
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,722
Gunfire nearby.

316
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,200
And this man, he's hiding.

317
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,967
He's crouched down, and
he's, like, shivering.

318
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:35,748
And he's hearing all of the...

319
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:39,238
The fighting and gunshots.

320
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,864
It was unexpected... whatever
happened was completely unexpected.

321
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:51,203
Women are screaming and running,
people are running all over the place.

322
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:56,030
Men are yelling at each other and
shooting each other and shooting people...

323
00:20:56,031 --> 00:21:00,351
Somebody's yelling about the apocalypse.

324
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,945
I definitely want to follow
up on what happened to the

325
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,477
two young girls kidnapped
on my client's property.

326
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,287
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

327
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:28,208
who says the story had
a very dramatic ending.

328
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:38,498
So I understand there was this Plum Tree
Massacre on the property I'm investigating

329
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,520
and that two young girls
were actually kidnapped

330
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,964
by the Native Americans
that did that massacre.

331
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,426
What can you tell me about that?

332
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:49,053
The two girls' names were Ruth
and Sarah King, age 2 and 4.

333
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:52,484
Their father's name was William
King, he was a member of the militia,

334
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:56,899
the colonial militia, and he was out of
the area when the massacre took place.

335
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,404
But the mother, Rachel, was gruesomely
killed in front of her two daughters.

336
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,577
But, for some reason,
these girls were spared

337
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:09,235
and taken up the
Sheshequin Trail to Canada.

338
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:12,206
- Okay.
- The younger child, Ruth...

339
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:17,798
Was sold to the wife of a British officer
who apparently couldn't have children.

340
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:20,779
And we don't know for sure what
happened to her sister Sarah,

341
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,581
but she did survive, and
she was in the area there.

342
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:26,571
Okay, so now, William King comes back

343
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:29,547
and found out his wife was murdered
and his two kids were missing.

344
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,188
That's correct.

345
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,611
There's this man...

346
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,689
I feel like he's alone.

347
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,980
I think maybe his wife is dead.

348
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:45,421
Uh, and maybe his children are far away.

349
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:49,517
There's also, like, a
woman off in the distance.

350
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:53,718
Like, I kinda get "escapee" with her.

351
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,367
She has a lot of anger.

352
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,353
Definitely a lost soul, that's for sure.

353
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,487
So what happened with the kids?

354
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:06,351
Well, their father never totally
gave up hope that he'd find them.

355
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:09,516
And seven years after
the massacre happened he,

356
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:12,500
found out where they were, and
so he set out to retrieve them.

357
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:16,868
He found an Indian guide to take
him north towards Fort Niagara.

358
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:17,809
Okay.

359
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,201
Somehow, he recovers the two children

360
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:23,334
and brings them back down
to the Williamsport area.

361
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,126
And led what appeared to
be a fairly normal life.

362
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:31,060
'Til, in 1802, he had an accident
on the river, a creek, he fell in,

363
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,305
got paralyzed, and it lingered
for several days, and died.

364
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:38,846
- Huh.
- At the age of 57.

365
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,191
I'm heading to the local library to find

366
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:45,897
anything else I can about
my client's property.

367
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:48,948
Searching through the archives...

368
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:53,233
I discovered the Lord family
lived there for generations.

369
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:57,656
Turns out, a lot of the family
members died on my client's land.

370
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,578
But a local genealogist tells me

371
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,919
a couple of those deaths
might help my investigation.

372
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:16,278
Now, the Lord family owned the property
I'm investigating for a pretty long time.

373
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,719
Yes, nearly 80 years, from 1882 to 1961.

374
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,369
Now, of all the deaths on this property,
you said a couple of them are unusual.

375
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,662
Oh, yes, there were two sisters.
The first was Sarah Bricker...

376
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:33,055
She lived in the house
out back of the property.

377
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:38,615
And, in 1903, she came over
to visit her sister next door.

378
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:41,609
- Okay.
- And just fell over dead.

379
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,747
From what?

380
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:47,570
What we would now say is
stroke or a cerebral hemorrhage.

381
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,996
Okay, so Sarah was 40 years old,
which was young, even for back then.

382
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:52,559
Yes.

383
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,746
Then, ten years later,
her sister, Amanda Lord,

384
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,371
passes away suddenly of the same thing.

385
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,162
Wow.

386
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:05,634
Okay, so ten years apart, two
sisters die from the same illness...

387
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:08,691
- On the same property.
- Yes.

388
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,392
That is unusual.

389
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,138
It's a sickness here.

390
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:23,187
Someone died in this room.

391
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,948
Very ill, female.

392
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:29,839
This woman, she crawls...

393
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,620
Into the ceiling and disappears.

394
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:41,331
So she doesn't have any
interaction with anybody.

395
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:46,074
Her pain is still
something that is here.

396
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:48,955
In a physical way.

397
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:54,722
She's like, "oh, you know,
bad, bad, it was bad".

398
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,941
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk.

399
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,977
But what has me the most concerned

400
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:09,995
is the Devil creature that's
tormenting a living woman.

401
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:14,316
This thing was coming out of a closet.

402
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:22,418
And it was pitch black, but
its skin was, like, glossy.

403
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:28,832
And there was a woman
who was yelling at him.

404
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,739
Is this what you saw?

405
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,084
Yes.

406
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:03,305
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

407
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:08,345
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

408
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:11,697
Well, Amy, I gotta tell ya,
this is probably one of the

409
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,834
hardest cases I've ever worked on.

410
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,464
I want to introduce
you to Jodi and Patrick.

411
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:19,165
They're a married couple that live here.

412
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,902
Listening to their stories was
pretty gut-wrenching for me.

413
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:26,431
Bottom line, Jodi thinks there's something
in this house that's trying to kill them.

414
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:28,775
And kill her specifically.

415
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:31,623
It's tearing their marriage apart.

416
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:35,100
They called us in because we're their
last hope so, with that being said,

417
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:40,981
I'm gonna ask Amy to tell us
a little bit about her walk.

418
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,738
I'm definitely aware that there's
a lot of issues here, and, um...

419
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:53,032
We'll get into everything
slowly but surely.

420
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,813
I went to the back yard, and...

421
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,187
I saw a lot of...

422
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:03,801
Really odd, like, violent
and chaotic images.

423
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:05,824
I was hearing gunfire.

424
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:09,075
It wasn't just men, you
know, I heard women screaming.

425
00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:12,309
I think I saw a woman get shot.

426
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,658
Whatever was happening had
just come out of nowhere.

427
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,868
A lot of what you're saying
is something I uncovered

428
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,612
and that you had pointed
me in the direction of.

429
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,266
You gotta know something about
this property we're on, Amy.

430
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:28,707
It was the scene of fierce battles of...

431
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:32,702
Native Americans against white settlers.

432
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:36,601
On June 10 in 1778,
right on this property...

433
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:39,029
There was an event called
the Plum Tree Massacre.

434
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,884
And when that massacre
was over, men, women,

435
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:47,585
and children were murdered,
all shot, stabbed, and scalped.

436
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:50,030
Where did the Native Americans live?

437
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:51,546
Here, this is their land.

438
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:56,341
White settlers were breaking
a treaty that was set in 1768.

439
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:00,637
Well, a lot of other stuff I got
is totally making sense now, so...

440
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,558
Okay.

441
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:06,482
At one point, I went
into the basement, and,

442
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:10,563
I encountered a Native American man.

443
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,230
He said that he feels guilty.

444
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:18,458
And he feels like, you
know, you can only want

445
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:22,239
so much agony for your enemies.

446
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,746
Now, Jodi, you saw a Native American
man in the basement, as well, right?

447
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:28,384
- Yes.
- Describe that for Amy for me.

448
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:31,484
He was sitting... what looked
like he was sitting on top

449
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:34,861
of the pipe in the back
room of the basement.

450
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:38,525
The brown pants, um, I
could see the white feathers.

451
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:44,426
I turned to walk away and turned
back around, and he was gone.

452
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:50,283
Who I think both of you might
have encountered is, um...

453
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,781
This guy Chief Cornplanter.

454
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:55,703
He was the war Chief
for the Seneca tribe.

455
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,572
This is a portrait.

456
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,997
Cornplanter is his
Indian name translated.

457
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,858
Wow.

458
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,050
He was considered a peaceful man.

459
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:08,955
He didn't want to be part
of any kind of fighting.

460
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:13,722
But after his tribe made a treaty with the
British Army, he became a violent killer.

461
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:19,623
He's responsible for killing at least
370 men, women, and children in this area.

462
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:24,323
Even though he was a peaceful man, he
turned into one of the bloodiest killers...

463
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:29,013
- Which makes sense.
- So, is this who you think you saw?

464
00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:33,694
- I think it could be, yes, I do.
- Okay.

465
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:39,203
I also ran into a Native American woman.

466
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,411
Unfortunately, the other
thing I got was that

467
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:44,739
she actually had
attached herself to you.

468
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,557
Like, I literally kinda saw
her, like, holding your arm.

469
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,206
She even, like, goes
into the bath with you.

470
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:56,362
Like, she just doesn't really leave you
alone, she's always kind of by your side.

471
00:30:56,363 --> 00:31:02,263
And I would think that you would feel
her presence, because she's always on you.

472
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:07,851
Everywhere I go in this house, I feel...

473
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:12,563
It feels like somebody else's
energy around me, constantly.

474
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:18,267
Anywhere I sit, it just feels like
somebody is with me, sharing my body.

475
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:21,923
It's just everywhere I
go. I go to bed at night...

476
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:24,454
Somebody's there.

477
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:27,152
I'm just not ever alone.

478
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:32,137
I tried to tell my family
what was going on in my house,

479
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:35,678
and they all laughed at me.

480
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:38,048
And ridiculed me.

481
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,949
I don't go to family functions, because I
know what they say about me behind my back.

482
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:48,632
Plus she doesn't think that Patrick
actually believes anything she says.

483
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:51,637
I understand people who
are skeptics because,

484
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:55,116
I think that when they
lash out like that, it's...

485
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:58,231
Based out of fear and ignorance.

486
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:03,152
I've gotta see things
in order to believe it.

487
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:07,711
It's been a tremendous
strain on our family.

488
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:12,347
It's been almost three years that
we've been putting up with this, the...

489
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,371
The ridicule.

490
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:17,850
But this is your wife and
your partner in your life.

491
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:21,237
You need to stand by her side and...

492
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:25,918
Screw the people who
are calling her names.

493
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,962
I get so angry, because he goes...

494
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:32,563
He goes and he leaves me sitting here.

495
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,909
Knowin' how they feel about me.

496
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,230
And it's very hard to sit here alone.

497
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:43,319
And I can't do anything with them.

498
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,580
Because, because they think I'm crazy.

499
00:32:48,415 --> 00:32:52,065
You see right now, I mean,
it's tearing me up right now.

500
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:55,486
Because she's so tore up.

501
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,484
I know this has been a
pretty tough night already,

502
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:01,759
but I think, Amy, you have more stuff?

503
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,560
I also came into contact
with another entity.

504
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,488
It...

505
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:15,296
Showed itself to me at one point
to look like a traditional...

506
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:18,597
Out-of-the-Bible devil.

507
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:23,817
The truer self of it was,
like, this very tall...

508
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:28,343
Um, completely black but
with, like, shiny skin.

509
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:31,964
And it had long, like,
fingers and nails.

510
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:34,776
And little horns, and, um...

511
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:37,342
It can show itself in different ways.

512
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:41,981
A Native American female
told me that this...

513
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:46,602
Thing had been here
for a very long time.

514
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,076
How would they see it is
what I'm curious about?

515
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:54,080
I would think some kind of blackness.

516
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:59,981
I see a lot of dark figure
shadows moving through the kitchen.

517
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,981
And a lot up in my bedroom.

518
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,661
It seemed to me that
he was focusing on you.

519
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:13,267
He had found whatever weakness
he perceives from you, about you.

520
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:17,228
He was psychologically abusing you.

521
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:23,263
He was grabbing and licking you and
doing inappropriate sexual things to you.

522
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,619
I was sexually assaulted
several times in the house.

523
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:35,806
I've been traumatized and basically
terrorized for three years.

524
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:41,544
I feel something standing over
me when I'm in my bed, and...

525
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,945
I'm scared.

526
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:50,240
How you doing over there?

527
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:53,996
The day that she was
attacked, that I came home...

528
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:58,084
I went through this house, screaming.

529
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:01,364
And I called whatever it was...

530
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,319
"You want something to
deal with, come get me".

531
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,980
And I woke up with bruises...

532
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,799
On my back.

533
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:13,482
That's one of the things I can't...

534
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:15,523
Debunk.

535
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:23,489
It's hard for me to be intimate
with my own husband because...

536
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,560
Of what happened to me.

537
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,349
She shared with me, when she was
younger, much younger, she was...

538
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,820
- I was gonna ask, right.
- Sexually assaulted by a family member.

539
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:43,161
- She doesn't have a support system.
- She does now.

540
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:50,764
I did do a sketch of what I saw
upstairs in your room, and...

541
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:54,665
It seemed to be that you were...

542
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:59,329
Very angry and stressed out at the time.

543
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:06,014
Oh,.

544
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,947
I just want my life back.

545
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,306
Jodi, come here.

546
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:56,975
I did do a sketch of what I saw
upstairs in your room, and...

547
00:36:56,976 --> 00:37:00,876
It seemed to be that you were...

548
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:05,968
Very angry and stressed out at the time.

549
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,331
Oh,.

550
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,020
I just want my life back.

551
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:49,225
Come here, Jodi, come here.

552
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,819
Put your arms around me, Jodi, please.

553
00:37:57,224 --> 00:38:00,025
Nobody believed me.

554
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:03,055
Who cares? [Bleep] 'Em.

555
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,996
Look at me...

556
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,897
We will take care of this, okay?

557
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:16,374
I love you.

558
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,038
You okay?

559
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:32,059
What is this thing?

560
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,883
This thing says that...

561
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:38,304
It has taken souls before.

562
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:43,984
It says that it has
and will hurt people.

563
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:49,242
And it stated, you know
that he's a part of you

564
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,070
and you're a part of him and
that he's going to get you.

565
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:57,034
He was also trying to project bad images

566
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,389
or dreams or something to you
to try to make you hurt yourself.

567
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:05,856
And that's part of the
manipulation that he was doing.

568
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:09,708
Now listen, Jodi, Patrick,
this has gotta be...

569
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:13,281
One of the most extremely emotional
nights you've ever been through.

570
00:39:13,282 --> 00:39:17,412
I know it has been for me when
it comes to working these cases.

571
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:20,271
But Jodi, now you know you're not crazy,

572
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:23,104
and you're actually in a fight
against something that's real.

573
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:27,445
Now, the big question, is there anything
you can do about it? And can you live a...

574
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:31,775
Normal life and get your
marriage back on track?

575
00:39:31,776 --> 00:39:36,897
For that, I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy and see what she has to say.

576
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:39,275
After the walk...

577
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,492
I did some research.

578
00:39:41,493 --> 00:39:45,426
Because I came into contact
with so many Native Americans...

579
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,562
I wanted to see if there
was anything in their history

580
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:54,104
that would clarify
maybe what this could be.

581
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:57,152
What I came across was...

582
00:39:57,153 --> 00:40:02,069
Something that tribes
referred to as the clown...

583
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,430
The trickster, and heyoka.

584
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,700
It was a human.

585
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:14,401
But they also felt that it
was half man and half spirit.

586
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:19,127
It's very possible that this entity...

587
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:21,830
Was a human being.

588
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:25,907
At one point and was part of a tribe.

589
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:31,068
And when he died, he
became the embodiment of it.

590
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,967
So how do they get rid of this thing?

591
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:37,728
First thing is, you should contact
your local Native American tribe.

592
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,183
That would be the Seneca
tribe for this area.

593
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:44,249
And you want to connect with the Shaman.

594
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,887
Let them know everything
that's been going on,

595
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:51,699
and then allow them to do whatever
ceremony they think is necessary.

596
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,292
Being raised Catholic and listening
to everything and seeing what I saw...

597
00:40:57,293 --> 00:41:00,421
Part of me wants to still...

598
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:04,037
Follow the train of thought
that this is some type of demon.

599
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:09,130
The next day, I would like you
to have someone from your church

600
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:13,969
come to your home and perform
an exorcism of the house.

601
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,662
What about this woman that's attached
to her, what happens with her?

602
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:20,923
As you start doing an exorcism this...

603
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:24,801
Native American male will remove her.

604
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:27,538
I don't think I have to ask you
if you're gonna take Amy's advice.

605
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:30,421
I'm definitely gonna do
everything she told me to do.

606
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,836
I just want this gone, I want...

607
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:35,985
I want to be able to
live in my home in peace

608
00:41:35,986 --> 00:41:40,835
and not have to worry about this
when I lay my head down at night.

609
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:44,976
I can't say I'm a skeptic anymore.

610
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,699
I'm not sure whether it will
be the Shaman or the exorcism

611
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,318
that will get rid of
these evil entities.
