1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,477
It's awful, awful in here.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,547
This wolf-looking guy -- He went
"Raah!" right in my face.

3
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,479
I felt real fear.

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:21,584
In front of two witnesses,
he stabs him to death.

5
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,102
"I'm dying.

6
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,551
I'm dying."

7
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,052
I know what I see.

8
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,119
Something's wrong.

9
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,855
And I know what I hear.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,340
He wants them to go.

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,791
He wants revenge.

12
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,226
It's really bad in here.

13
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,345
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,429
Something is not right.

15
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:42,995
I see dead people.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,231
This person might have been
a serial killer.

17
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,098
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,931
You get those chills.

19
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,233
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,701
He is darkness.
He is evil.

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,738
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

22
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:57,605
I think she broke her neck.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,090
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,506
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,641
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

26
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,140
You telling me the truth?

27
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,744
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,379
I think the devil
is down here.

29
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:10,730
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:12,623
Who the hell
would do this?

31
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,447
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:16,449
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:17,783
...until the very end.

34
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:19,150
Who's he looking to kill?

35
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,319
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

36
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,454
You need to get out of here
right now.

37
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:24,554
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:27,123
It was like endless darkness.

39
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:50,671
STEVE: I always head to our
locations before Amy arrives.

40
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:53,940
I dig up facts
about the property's dark past

41
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:56,492
while Amy speaks to the dead.

42
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,974
I'm in Potsdam, New York.

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,744
It's about 30 minutes south
of the Canadian border.

44
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:04,196
We got called in
by a woman named Donna.

45
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,613
Like me, she's a retired
homicide detective.

46
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,549
She actually sounded embarrassed
needing our help,

47
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,400
but as a cop, I understand that.

48
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:13,182
Bottom line --
She and her family

49
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,417
are being terrorized by spirits
in the house.

50
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:18,721
And all her experience
can't help her solve this case.

51
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:29,893
MATTHEW: Before Amy arrives,

52
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,096
I clear the area
of any leading information.

53
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:35,781
This home
has a lot of family photos

54
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,899
that need to be covered
or removed.

55
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,665
When I'm finished,

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,935
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

57
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:05,449
I saw these men who were walking
like monkeys, like gorillas.

58
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,785
It just looks like
their, you know, skin

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,186
has been painted on black,

60
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:14,753
and they're barking
and growling.

61
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:20,024
One was saying that
they get used up or something,

62
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:24,027
and then they fall
into little dust.

63
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,060
He was a living person.

64
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,662
I don't know about the others.

65
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:35,968
They are protecting
certain things from being known.

66
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:49,109
STEVE: Now, Donna, you sounded
pretty upset on the phone.

67
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:51,978
And you're a former
homicide detective like myself.

68
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,813
I know it had to be tough
for you to even call us.

69
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,078
I've tried everything
I can do.

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,379
We've been terrorized here

71
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:59,447
with the things
that have been happening here.

72
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,583
Okay. So why don't you
tell me what's going on?

73
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,549
Well,
our son has seen things,

74
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,685
I've been woken up
and seen things,

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,051
and my skeptical husband

76
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,354
has even seen things
and been touched.

77
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,955
And how old is your son?

78
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,321
He's 17.

79
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:15,491
Latest apparition he saw,
he ran into my room screaming,

80
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,994
and that's why
I wrote you guys a letter.

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,427
I need a solution
'cause it's got to stop.

82
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:22,828
- You were a detective down
in south Florida, right? - Yes.

83
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,896
What brought you here?

84
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,866
I was born and raised up here,
and I left for 32 years.

85
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,133
And my son,
at the time, was 10.

86
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,133
And living in south Florida
with a child,

87
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,401
I wanted to bring him back
to a peaceful place.

88
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,371
You don't have to worry
about the criminal element here.

89
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:37,937
Right.

90
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,772
But you have to worry
about some other element now.

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,139
Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:45,043
I'm pissed off,
and the fight's on.

93
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,850
There's this living woman.

94
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:08,357
And she's saying that this home
is not working for her.

95
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,756
She hates it,

96
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,594
and she feels like this house
is, like, closing in on her.

97
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,328
She's probably an empath.

98
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,296
MATTHEW:
Why do you say that?

99
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:24,166
Her emotions --
She pushes them out of her.

100
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:28,002
There's a lot of anger
in this room from her.

101
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,470
Something's wrong.

102
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,042
So, Donna,
why'd you bring me in here?

103
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,641
We've had
a lot of bad luck.

104
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,412
A lot of freaky things with
the appliances breaking down.

105
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,711
They're all new appliances.

106
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,681
And we've been hit by lightning
here

107
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,581
not once, but twice
in seven years.

108
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,984
The odds on that
got to be astronomical.

109
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,085
It's like a magnet
or something.

110
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,218
We had a chimney fire

111
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,620
that caught the whole front yard
on fire.

112
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,686
That's crazy.

113
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:02,988
Anything else going on?

114
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,556
I sit over there,
watching TV,

115
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:09,391
and I see this blob
of a black shadow,

116
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:12,328
and I look to make sure
I'm not seeing things,

117
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,728
and it just moves so fast.

118
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:16,364
I've seen that
about five times recently.

119
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,332
When it moves,
it's pretty massive.

120
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,802
And you're sure it's not
something from outside coming in

121
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,501
to make you see this?

122
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:25,602
I'm positive,
'cause my dog has --

123
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,021
When he sees it,
he starts growling and barking.

124
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,405
And you get up to investigate,
and it's gone.

125
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,474
It's gone.

126
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,110
This is a very bad area.

127
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,847
Things happen here
to the living people

128
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:43,982
with these things.

129
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,047
And this family --

130
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,683
I think they think it's
shadow people, but it's not.

131
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:52,784
The painted creatures who were
acting like monkeys<i> outside</i>

132
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,222
are now projecting themselves as
shadow people<i> inside</i> the house.

133
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,190
Whoever's in control
of these things

134
00:06:58,225 --> 00:07:00,123
wants them
to torment the living.

135
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,358
They, like --
They'll see them like that,

136
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:04,694
but then
they'll see them get up.

137
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,860
There's, like, this panic.

138
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:11,431
Like, I hear a woman screaming
and running out of here.

139
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,369
So,
what's going on up here?

140
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,936
This is the worst of it.

141
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:25,072
I get woke up a lot
in the middle of the night.

142
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,338
Give me a for-instance.

143
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,574
Well, the other night,
I was sleeping,

144
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,107
and, all of a sudden,

145
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:33,277
right in my face
was this wolf-looking guy,

146
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,176
and he went "Raah!"
right in my face.

147
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,646
- You're not on medication
or anything, right? - No.

148
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,580
If you were back on the job,
talking to people,

149
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,049
and somebody told you
this story...

150
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,214
- I would think they're crazy.
- Right.

151
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,251
Which my husband probably
does think I'm crazy for.

152
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,985
And then another time,

153
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,356
I woke up about 3:00
in the morning for no reason.

154
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,622
I see this huge, big guy

155
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:58,224
standing on the side of the bed,
looking at me.

156
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:01,227
He was about
at least over 6 feet tall.

157
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,695
He didn't look like
he was happy.

158
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,331
He was kind of menacing.

159
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:16,870
I saw an older man
who was hiding things.

160
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:22,005
He's very condescending.

161
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,843
He has an elitist attitude
about everything.

162
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:30,010
He's very scary.

163
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:33,712
MATTHEW:
Is there any connection between
him and the painted people?

164
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,480
AMY: He put them to work
for him.

165
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,584
He painted them all black
and creepy-looking,

166
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:45,487
and he makes them
show themselves to people

167
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,320
and scare them.

168
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:51,723
And he does
take their energy.

169
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:55,060
When they're all used up,
they become like dust.

170
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:58,363
And what happens, then,
when they turn into dust?

171
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:00,798
They cease to be.

172
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,867
STEVE:
Now, is there anything else
you've seen up here?

173
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,002
Yeah, one night, I was up here
with a few friends,

174
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,752
and I felt something
behind me.

175
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:11,468
And I look,
and I see this arm.

176
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,836
It had a black sleeve,

177
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,306
the skinny old-lady fingers
with nails.

178
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,742
So, you just saw the arm,
not the --

179
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:19,706
Just saw the arm.

180
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,841
Where was it coming from?

181
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,241
It was coming
from behind me.

182
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,710
Okay, so, it was as if somebody
was behind you going like this?

183
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:28,147
Yeah, trying to get my attention
or, like, cutting me off.

184
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,614
Did you see the lady?

185
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:30,847
No.

186
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,533
Do you think there's evil
in this house?

187
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:36,185
I don't think
it's on the good side.

188
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,619
It wants us out of here.

189
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,355
Okay.

190
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:48,358
I think that this guy
has a little bit of a problem

191
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,226
with the people in this room

192
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,094
because they know about him.

193
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,728
He hates it.

194
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,298
So he wants them to go.

195
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,997
Ooh!

196
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,099
This is...Mmm.

197
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,969
This is not good, all right?

198
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,787
Oh, I don't like it.

199
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,230
Okay, just a sec.

MATTHEW: Are you okay?

203
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:16,175
I felt really, really scared.

204
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,978
It's, like, real fear.

205
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,456
STEVE: Andrew,
I was talking to mom,

206
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,859
and she told me about the things
that are going on in the house,

207
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,727
and she told me
you're having a tough time here.

208
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,829
Yeah. I've experienced
some things here.

209
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,061
In seventh grade,

210
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,731
I saw a shadow figure
dart across my front lawn.

211
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,031
Describe what you saw.

212
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,534
I saw, like,
a black-figured human being.

213
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:57,766
Okay.

214
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,935
Had you ever seen this thing
again?

215
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,669
Yeah, recently, actually.

216
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,302
I was coming home
from football,

217
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:04,572
and I came in the driveway,
and I saw it.

218
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,104
Really?

219
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,307
It kind of, like,
lifted its head up and ran.

220
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:10,209
Okay. So, now,
what about the house?

221
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,677
What have you experienced
in the house?

222
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:15,076
I was sleeping on this bed,
and I woke up,

223
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:19,180
and I saw a man dressed in an
army uniform standing over me.

224
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,013
- And he was just
staring at you? - Yeah.

225
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,917
Now, how long did this thing
last in front of you?

226
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,282
About two seconds,

227
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,352
and then I thought it was
a human being standing there,

228
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,651
so I kicked him in the face.

229
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:30,754
My foot went through his face,
and he disappeared.

230
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:31,953
That was it?

231
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,354
I ran out in the hallway,

232
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:36,190
and I kind of, like,
hyperventilated a little bit.

233
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,623
I don't like being here
alone.

234
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:42,027
All right, so, what do you
think's going on here?

235
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:45,396
Something doesn't want us here,
or I don't know.

236
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,330
Okay.

This older man I saw --

He is pissed,
because when he died,

239
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:03,307
he kind of lost control
over everything.

around the house,

he holds over the dead here.

[ Grunts ]
He's like, "Keep up."

Okay.

247
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:26,254
He says
that most of these people

248
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,320
were men when he met them.

249
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:31,790
I mean, they were dead men,
but they were men.

250
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:36,860
And he made them
what they are now.

251
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:42,364
He says, because he is superior
in every way,

252
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,799
that's why he's able
to dominate them.

253

When he was alive,
I think he was haunted by them,

254
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,604
and he flipped
that whole **** around.

255

I was talking
to your wife.

that you really don't

00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:12,614
I don't think
they're lying,

261
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,250
but I'm not seeing
what they're seeing,

what to do about it.

there's something going on.

there's a cord with a tag on it.

One night,
I went up there to go lay down,

and before I went to lay down,
it flapped rapidly.

No.
That's the whole thing.

00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,100
Okay.

00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:47,170
And I thought to myself,
"Well, Donna might be right."

276
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:50,204
And before I went to sleep,
I said, "**** you,"

00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,672

00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:57,843
I was laying on the sofa,
trying to take a nap,

281

and I felt a vivid touch
on my face,

Yes.

Whatever was there that caused
that, I couldn't explain.

I feel a lot of pain,
but it's not really --

No, pain isn't the right word.

292
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,830
It's pressure.

But he'll push on people, like,
squish them or shove them.

He doesn't like living people.

and he wants revenge.

The first thing I usually do
in these investigations

is try to find out
who lived on the property.

Turns out
one of the former owners

304

actually passed away
of a heart attack in the house.

Okay.
How long did you live here?

From 1978 until 1983.

During your time here,

312
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,122
did you ever experience anything
you couldn't explain?

313
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:12,423
Not a thing.

314

I can't recall anything
ever strange happening here.

Your father died here,

316

and what'd your father do
for a living?

He had been in the service,
you know, in the Korean War.

00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:25,130
I brought a picture
to show in his uniform.

319
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:29,867
Then he was an insurance man
for a great many years,

320
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:34,404
and before he passed, he was a
manager at an auto-parts store.

321
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,537
Okay.

322
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:39,941
So, what kind of a guy
was your dad?

323
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,073
He was a tough guy.

324
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,675
It was either his way
or the highway.

325
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:45,861
Didn't show
a whole lot of emotion.

326
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,011
He was basically
a very strict dad.

327
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,479
What kind of a relationship
did you have with him?

328
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,112
I was always cautious.

329
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,814
He would get heated
pretty quickly.

330
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,250
Makes you be on eggshells.
I was, like, on eggshells a lot.

331
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,553
AMY:
I see that older man in here.

332
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,473
He doesn't like it
when people know about him.

333
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:10,358
It freaks him out.
It disturbs him. He hates it.

334
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:13,160
When he was alive,

335
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,495
he had control
over everything, every aspect,

336
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,330
and then he died
and, like, "Oh ****

337
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,331
He's dead."

338
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,665
I think it was unexpected death.

339
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,803
He didn't have any control,
and he got really mad.

340
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,372
What the **** is that about?

341
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,941
What kind of relationship
did your mom and dad have?

342
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:38,075
Well, they were together
a very long time.

343
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,610
They were
high-school sweethearts.

344
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,043
Okay.

345
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,610
But I think, you know,
before he passed,

346
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,546
it was probably a low point
of their relationship.

347
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:45,913
She wasn't home.

348
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,115
She wasn't here
when he had passed.

349
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,247
She was in Florida.

350
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:51,016
I don't think
that he was happy

351
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,050
about her going away
on vacation.

352
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,618
And before she went away,
he said, you know,

353
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,888
"I'm not gonna be around
that much longer, anyways.

354
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,856
I'm not gonna be living
that long."

355
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,256
Just like that?

356
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,623
Just like that.

357
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,026
Three days later, when she was
gone in Florida, he died.

358
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,826
She felt horrible.

359
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,596
It was so tragic
and such a shock.

360
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,331
Now, where did he die
in the house?

361
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,563
He died in the garage.

362
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:17,566
Okay.
Would you mind showing me?

363
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,420
Does it bother you
being in here?

364
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:27,169
It's very strange
being in here.

365
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,139
This is where
he took his last breath.

366
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,673
It was very hard
to come in here

367
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,575
and know that
this is where it happened.

368
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,874
Right.

369
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,311
And what year did he die?

370
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,344
He died in 1992.

371
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,679
Now,
was there any indication

372
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,648
that he had a heart problem
or a heart condition?

373
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,015
There was no signs.
There was nothing.

374
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,418
Who was the first family member
to come home?

375
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:47,449
I was.

376
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,034
You were?

377
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:48,584
Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,350
What did you see?

379
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:55,254
Well, I found over in this area
a small round circle of blood

380
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:57,424
where he had hit his head.

381
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,224
Did you clean it?

382
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,194
It's the first thing I did
after I pulled myself together.

383
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,493
It was important to me.

384
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:06,062
That's all I could focus on
was to go into the house

385
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:07,496
and to clean it up

386
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,698
'cause I didn't want my mom
to see that when she got home.

387
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,467
He died alone,
and that's just really tragic.

388
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,399
That's how my mom died, too,

389
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,620
and it bothered me
thinking about her dying alone.

390
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,806
When I came out here
and I found the spot of blood,

391
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:25,474
it just was --
It hit me full force.

392
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:26,342
Right.

393
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:27,176
He's gone.

394
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,545
MATTHEW:
Do you know how he died?

395
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,512
Some kind of, like,
aneurysm, sudden heart a--

396
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,747
you know,
sudden death, whatever.

397
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:41,183
You know, it was something
completely unexpected.

398
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,351
Do you know
when he was alive?

399
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,586
'80s, '90s.

400
00:19:53,457 --> 00:20:00,463
I feel a pain -- back and
my neck -- pretty **** bad.

401
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:04,732
I feel anger and stress.

402
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,798
[ Sighs ] ****

403
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:14,303
When I'm hearing his thoughts,
I'm thinking I'm dying.

404
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,038
"I'm dying. I'm dying."

405
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,341

unexplained activity

410
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,153
STEVE: I need to find out

411
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:45,823
what else might have happened
on my client's property,

412
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,856
so I hit the books
at the local library.

413
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:52,059
Digging through old deeds, I
find a man named Frank Bancroft

414
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,159
originally owned Donna's land.

415
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,595
Turns out he was hit and killed
by a car

416
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,064
while walking back home.

417
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,433
Now that I know
a former owner of Donna's land

418
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:05,500
died in an accident,

419
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:07,333
I reached out
to a local genealogist.

420
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:10,137
He tells me that that tragedy
was only the beginning

421
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:12,906
of the Bancroft family's
problems on that property.

422
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,178
So, Dennis,
I came across this article

423
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,677
about this guy,
Frank Bancroft.

424
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:26,879
So, I was wondering, what do you
know about what happened to him?

425
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,313
He was intoxicated,

426
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,450
and he was
wandering down the road,

427
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:31,781
and he was struck by a car.

428
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:34,384
He died as a result
of a skull fracture

429
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,818
and some hemorrhaging,

430
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,021
of which
we have some information,

431
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,189
including
his death certificate.

432
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:44,490
This happens in 1937.

433
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:45,490
Yes.

434
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,376
This was actually
the second time

435
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,228
he was hit by a car
within two weeks.

436
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,460
Okay.

437
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:53,597
But he really didn't sustain
any injury that first time.

438
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:54,862
Well, what's the matter
with this guy?

439
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,032
He's walking down the street
and keeps getting hit by cars?

440
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,168
I think a lot of it has to do
with the passing of his wife.

441
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:04,170
In 1934, his wife passed
with pneumonia.

442
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,670
He just really
never got over it.

443
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,938
He got sort of despondent
and began drinking.

444
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,007
You weren't kidding
about bad luck with this guy.

445
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:12,973
Yes.

446
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:15,074
Later on, in 1932,

447
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,110
his horse barn
was hit by lightning

448
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:18,344
and destroyed.

449
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:22,081
Then, in 1935,
his house burned to the ground,

450
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:24,881
and he barely made it out
alive.

451
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:28,084
So, now, once Frank dies,
what happens to the property?

452
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,886
The property goes
to his only daughter, Hazel,

453
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,654
which we have a picture of her
when she was 12.

454
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,822
What did she do
with the property?

455
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,122
Do you have any idea?

456
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:40,524
In 1946, she had a boarder
named Frank Reninger

457
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,091
that was living there,

458
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,561
and one day,
he started beating on her,

459
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,060
and he almost killed her.

460
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:49,080
She finally escaped
by going down through the cellar

461
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:52,065
and out the side door
to the neighbor's to get help.

462
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:55,867
Now, is there any reason why
she got beat up by this guy?

463
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:57,702
I don't know
if anybody really knows.

464
00:22:57,737 --> 00:22:59,068
Like, he snapped.

465
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,738
I would say that probably
would be what happened to him.

466
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,876
It's awful, awful...

467
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:12,478
awful, awful in here.

468
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:19,580
A lot of emotions in here --
desperate.

469
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:25,285
I heard screaming, too,
like, a female screaming.

470
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,855
I do see a woman,
and she's from a bit ago --

471
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,991
100 years ago, 125 years.

472
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:37,093
And she sits and cries.

473
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:41,861
She's in a nightdress,
she's got a nightcap on,

474
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:45,962
and she's just weeping
and weeping and weeping.

475
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:50,368
While she was gone, this Frank
set fire to her house,

476
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:52,602
and it destroyed the house.

477
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,837
We have
a little bit of information

478
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,638
on that particular fire.

479
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,023
I tell you, Dennis,
this is pretty wild stuff

480
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:03,308
because two houses
burned on their property

481
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,075
before my clients
even got there.

482
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,377
Their house was hit by lightning
twice in the last seven years.

483
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,245
Plus,
their chimney caught fire.

484
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,414
So you got two lightning strikes
in the last seven years

485
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,548
and two houses that burned down
on the property before that.

486
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,082
Actually, four houses.

487
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:17,282
Four houses?

488
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:20,568
One in 1901
and the other in 1911.

489
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:23,820
So, four times
houses burned down.

490
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:24,955
Yes.

491
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,090
STEVE: During my research,

492
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,190
I also uncovered a murder
that took place

493
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,960
just a short distance away
from Donna's house.

494
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,696
I'm on my way
to meet with a local historian,

495
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,063
who tells me
the crime was so brutal,

496
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,498
it had the whole town
in a frenzy.

497
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:51,870
So, now, this murder I came
across during my research --

498
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,105
It looked like
it was pretty prominent.

499
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,170
Yes.

500
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:57,806
The Donavan/Rowley case,
which was in 1852.

501
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:01,077
John Donavan and James Rowley
spend the evening drinking.

502
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:03,445
They start arguing
and get into a fight.

503
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,679
Friends kind of
calm them down,

504
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,965
make them shake hands
to be friendly,

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,216
and they depart
each other's company.

506
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:16,886
Donavan goes back in a bar
and starts drinking again.

507
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,987
A friend of Donavan's
starts telling him

508
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,821
how he should not
have apologized.

509
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,522
Okay, so, this guy
is instigating Donavan?

510
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:23,489
Yes.

511
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:25,323
And as Donavan drinks more,

512
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,891
he gets more worked up
about Rowley,

513
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,028
so he actually leaves the bar
with his knife

514
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,628
and goes
and hunts James Rowley down

515
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:35,964
and, in front of two witnesses,
stabs him to death

516
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,331
and kind of
disembowels him.

517
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,297
Ooh! Okay.

518
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:41,300
He's apprehended
that night,

519
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,703
and, the next day,
finds out what he did.

520
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:46,036
He has no recollection
of the murder,

521
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:49,639
so he showed a lot of remorse
after this in a trial

522
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,639
but was convicted
of first-degree murder.

523
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,209
All right, so, what winds up
happening that night?

524
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:56,709
He was hung
just outside the jail.

525
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:59,611
Between 1,200 and 1,500 people
attended the hanging.

526
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:08,416
AMY: Someone's talking
about the murders,

527
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:14,821
and I'm seeing someone
getting stabbed to death.

528
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:22,126
There's someone wearing
a white button-down shirt,

529
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:23,258
a male,

530
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:24,927
and he's getting
stabbed to death.

531
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,495
Where is he being stabbed?

532
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,832
In his abdomen and chest.

533
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,303
During my walk,
I saw an angry man

534
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:45,339
who was in control of
the painted people in the house.

535
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:48,041
I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to draw him.

536
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,311
He's between 55 and 65.

537
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,210
He is balding.

538
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:59,046
He has deep-set eyes.

539
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:00,947
Next, I described a scene

540
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:03,783
where the painted people
were tormenting the living.

541
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:07,853
There's a thing.
He's been painted black.

542
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,754
He's using his hands.

543
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,189
And he was reaching out
for her.

544
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:18,326
It was just
a very freaky kind of scene.

545
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:25,697
Is this what you saw?

546
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,532
Yes.

547
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:56,415
STEVE: Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

548
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,248
we're ready
to reveal our findings

549
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:01,385
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

550
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,518
Amy,
I'd like you to meet Donna.

551
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:06,471
Now, Donna is a retired
homicide detective like myself,

552
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:09,390
so when she called us in,
I knew things had to be serious,

553
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,675
and, actually, they are.

554
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,890
She's being terrorized

555
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,692
by the things
that are going on in this house.

556
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:15,192
This is her husband, Millard.

557
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,429
He's had a few experiences,
but he remains a skeptic.

558
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,631
One thing they both agree on
is they're fighting mad.

559
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,598
They're not gonna let
whatever's here

560
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:24,931
drive them out of their house.

561
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,817
With that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

562
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,668
and have her tell us
about her walk.

563
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:33,339
AMY: So I was out
in the front yard,

564
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:35,872
and I overhear two women
gossiping.

565
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,241
One woman is saying,
"Oh, my," you know,

566
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:40,241
"Did you hear
about the murders?"

567
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:44,011
One of the victims that I saw
was a male,

568
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:47,747
and someone
was stabbing him to death

569
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:52,414
in the abdomen/chest area.

570
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:55,118
Now I didn't think
this would have came into play,

571
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,787
but there was a homicide
that took place in 1852...

572
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,218
...on your property.
- Okay.

573
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,354
Two guys got into a fight
in a bar.

574
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,188
People that see it break it up,

575
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,591
and they make them shake hands
and quiet down.

576
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,956
One guy's name
was John Donavan.

577
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,626
The other guy's name
was James Rowley.

578
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,592
Rowley leaves the bar,

579
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:13,428
and John Donavan stays
and continues to drink.

580
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:14,627
A friend of his comes up

581
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:16,430
and starts egging him on,
saying, "You know what?

582
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,199
You should have never
apologized to that guy.

583
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,417
You should have
stood your ground."

584
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:22,566
Now, he eggs him on to the point

585
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:24,567
where he goes out,
finds him on the street,

586
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:27,737
and he stabs him a few times
in the chest and the stomach.

587
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:29,405
He stabs him so bad,
he disemboweled him.

588
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,407
Donavan was actually hanged
for that homicide.

589
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:35,543
Wow.

590
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,877
What else did you see?

591
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,981
I came inside,
walked around the first floor,

592
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,217
and I got
that a living woman here

593
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,983
was mad and angry,

594
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,118
and I was hearing her say

595
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:57,756
how much she hates the house
and how she feels trapped,

596
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:00,222
like the home
is crushing her.

597
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:06,426
And this female
seems to be empathic.

598
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:13,332
So this anger and hatred
actually fills the atmosphere.

599
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:17,717
Well,
does it sound like you?

600
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,534
It does sound like me.
Yeah.

601
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:25,039
Like, sometimes,
I can feel when people are sick.

602
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:29,008
And it comes
without any warning.

603
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:30,526
Okay.

604
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:32,010
Not good.

605
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:36,913
Oh, my gosh.

606
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,350
What else was going on
during your walk?

607
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:45,382
At one point,
I went upstairs.

608
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:50,037
I went into, I guess,
the master bedroom.

609
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:54,657
And I felt extremely intense
feeling of fear.

610
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:58,591
After the fear came in,
sadness.

611
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:04,395
Then I saw this old woman,

612
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,265
and she was just rocking
and, like, moaning and crying.

613
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,867
It seemed like it was
about 100 to 125 years ago,

614
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:15,502
just by the way
she was dressed.

615
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:18,636
Tell Amy what you saw.

616
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:21,106
You were talking about
the old woman's arm.

617
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:23,372
Well,
I felt something behind me,

618
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:28,476
and then I saw this skinny arm
with a black sleeve

619
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,843
with these long nails,

620
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:32,411
just going like this
behind me.

621
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:34,347
I'm like, "What the heck?"
And I turn around.

622
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,716
There's nothing there.

623
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:39,015
This may be a long shot,

624
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,951
but a woman that used to
live on this property

625
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,853
had a pretty tragic time here.

626
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:46,686
Her name is Hazel Bancroft.

627
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:50,424
Her mother, Harriet,
died of pneumonia back in 1934.

628
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:53,591
Now in 1937,
after the mother died,

629
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,125
her dad, Frank --

630
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,496
He gets hit by a car one night
and ends up dying, as well.

631
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,161
Oh, my God.

632
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,966
So, now, the daughter winds up
taking over the property.

633
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:08,466
1946, she's got a boarder
who's 68 years old,

634
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:11,102
and she just comes home
from the market or something.

635
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,869
He meets her at the door,

636
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:16,273
and he starts beating the hell
out of her for no reason.

637
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,308
She literally escaped
with her life

638
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:20,226
by running out
the back of the house,

639
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:22,074
down in the basement
and then and out.

640
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,444
Once she escapes,
the guy burned the house down.

641
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,110
Wow.

642
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,347
Now, could the woman
you were talking about

643
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:31,514
been either her
or maybe her mother?

644
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,315
Possibly her mother.

645
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,185
By the way, that was the fourth
house to burn on this property.

646
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,720
I mean,
these are some of the articles.

647
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:44,455
1901, 1911, and 1935,

648
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,024
houses were all burned down
on this property.

649
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,559
Did you know anything
about these fires at all?

650
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,491
Absolutely not.
No.

651
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:53,429
They've had their house
hit by lightning twice

652
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:54,761
in the seven years
they're here,

653
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:56,762
and you also had a chimney fire,
right? - Yes.

654
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:59,966
So, now you have four houses
burnt to the ground...

655
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,465
...on this property.
- Right.

656
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,568
Your house has been hit twice
with lightning,

657
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:06,068
and you had the chimney fire.

658
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,571
And if we weren't home,
it wouldn't be here today.

659
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,872
[ Sighs ]

660
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,807
There's no such thing
as coincidence

661
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:14,609
when you have this many.

662
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,376
Yeah, I agree with that.

663
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:20,443
So, how'd the rest of the walk
go?

664
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:26,515
Well, the most powerful entity
that I met in the house

665
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:32,552
was this older dead man
who was very condescending.

666
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:35,887
[ Sighs ]
He talks too **** fast.

667
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,486
[ Scoffs ]

668
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:40,755
And he calls me a dimwit.

669
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,991
He's like, "Keep up."

670
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,191
He was very controlling.

671
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:47,492
In fact,
he's a control freak.

672
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,578
But here's the thing --
The way that he died

673
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,630
was maybe an aneurysm
or a heart attack,

674
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,998
and this really upset him

675
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,868
because it was something
that was out of his control.

676
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,836
And this was probably
in the '80s or '90s.

677
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:03,569
[ Scoffs ]

678
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:06,905
He is upset
with living people

679
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,807
because he feels like
when he died,

680
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,042
he was very disrespected.

681
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,927
Well, I think I know
who you're talking about.

682
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:18,846
There's a guy
that died in this house in 1992.

683
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:21,180
The name of Cleave Lytle.

684
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:25,351
He died unexpected, died
of a heart attack in the garage.

685
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,184
Great.

686
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,018
Now, I talked to his daughter,
Betsy.

687
00:34:29,053 --> 00:34:32,054
She described him as a "My way
or the highway" type of guy.

688
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:36,589
He was not very warm,
not affectionate.

689
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,927
Now, I got photos of him.

690
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:45,579
He was actually in the army.

691
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,762
He was in the army.
Wow.

692
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,132
Your son said he saw somebody
in an army uniform

693
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,667
standing over his bed, right?

694
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:53,167
He sure did, plain as day.

695
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,369
Our son,
he's always scared.

696
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:01,205
Just the other night,
he was yelling in his sleep

697
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,273
and came out walking
like he was in a daze,

698
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:04,841
and he doesn't
even remember that.

699
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:06,472
That was just the other day.

700
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,744
Oh. I'm glad he's not sitting here
to look at that.

701
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:14,247
And here's a couple of pictures
of him years later.

702
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,547
Wow.

703
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:22,853
I did do a sketch,
but I saw no hair on top.

704
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:29,156
Wow.
Take a look at that.

705
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,760
Oh, my God.

706
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:41,930
Mm.
It could pass for him, yes.

707
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:47,834
That's definitely him.
The eyes are right on.

708
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,400
What's this guy's story?

709
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:55,706
He is kind of a leader
of about 25 other dead men.

710
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,440
Oh, boy.

711
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:02,510
And what he did to them was,
he painted their skin black,

712
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:07,379
and he makes them
kind of move like a gorilla,

713
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,614
and they'll bark
like a dog.

714
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:11,715
It's very strange.

715
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,747
He uses their energy,

716
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:17,752
and he'll use it so much
that he literally uses them up,

717
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:19,453
and then they turn to dust

718
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,120
and cease to even be
anymore.

719
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:22,753
Oh, my God.

720
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,256
He makes them
frighten the living.

721
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,425
The living people would probably
perceive them as shadow men,

722
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,426
but they're not.

723
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:32,692
Oh, my God.

724
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,560
Now, you've mentioned...

725
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,894
...you've seen shadow figures
in the kitchen. - In the kitchen.

726
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,880
You look out
of the corner of your eye,

727
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:41,507
and you see something
about 6 foot tall,

728
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:44,100
and I go to look, and it...
Away it goes.

729
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,370
And I've seen that several times
recently.

730
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:51,139
I did a sketch
of what I saw.

731
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,175
Ooh.

732
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,709
What the ****

733
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:02,312
I don't know if you're gonna
want to see this.

734
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:07,280
Oh, my God.

735
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,850
This is exactly
how I see that.

736
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,985
**** exactly
how I see that.

737
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:29,428
AMY: I did a sketch
of what I saw.

738
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,429
What the ****

739
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:33,965
I don't know if you're gonna
want to see this.

740
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,933
DONNA: Oh, my God.

741
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:41,502
This is exactly
how I see that.

742
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:44,637
**** exactly
how I see that.

743
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,574
So, they're not shadow people,
like you --

744
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:51,540
No.

745
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:52,607
Real people.

746
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,477
Yeah, they're enslaved.

747
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:56,011
Oh, my God.

748
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:56,977
Wow.

749
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:59,544
That's crazy.

750
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,380
So, where are these people
coming from?

751
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,515
Well, they're -- I don't know.
He collected them.

752
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,452
He just makes them kind of
**** with the living people.

753
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,784
Can we **** with him?

754
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,520
Yeah,
can we **** with him?

755
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,188
I think so.

756
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,521
- Good.
- Yeah. - Game on.

757
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,457
They just make you
anxious and scared,

758
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:18,289
and they'll mess around.

759
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:21,293
But he got that he could
interact with the living.

760
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:24,479
He can blind you
through migraines,

761
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:27,906
cause hallucinations,
fear and panic.

762
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:31,299
He likes to bother and/or scare
children.

763
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,332
Nice.

764
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:35,634
He can touch
by, like, shaking, pushing down,

765
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:37,301
feeling smothered --
things like that.

766
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:40,037
Now, you said he could
cause hallucinations, right?

767
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:41,337
Yes.

768
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:43,606
Tell Amy what you saw
in your bedroom.

769
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,439
When I first moved in,

770
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:50,043
I got woke up
by this horrible wolf thing.

771
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,778
Now, is that what he's capable
of doing, what she's describing?

772
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,981
I think so, yeah.
Absolutely.

773
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,482
You got touched.

774
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:57,913
I felt I did, yes.

775
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,147
Tell Amy what happened.

776
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,116
MILLARD: On the sofa,
I couldn't go to sleep.

777
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,985
I felt a vivid finger.

778
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,283
Poke you?

779
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:08,387
Not hard, not painful,
nothing -- Just, it was there.

780
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,688
STEVE: What does he want?

781
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,657
He wants control
and to dominate.

782
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:18,593
He would probably prefer
no living people around here.

783
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:21,863
Now, how's it feel knowing that
somebody doesn't want you here?

784
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,895
**** him.

785
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,299
So he can move out
to the **** yard.

786
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,570
Well, you two said
you were up for a fight.

787
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,035
Looks like you got one
on your hands.

788
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,572
The big question is, is it safe
for you guys to stay here?

789
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,924
And is it safe for your son
to stay here?

790
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,241
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

791
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,212
So, there's a few things
that you're going to have to do.

792
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,279
The first thing

793
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:53,949
is to get rid of the people
that are inside the house.

794
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,068
This is their chance
to leave nicely.

795
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:01,945
So, what you're gonna do
is take this.

796
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,788
This is, like,
quick-lighting charcoal.

797
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:07,589
So, you can break it up
into four pieces,

798
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:12,359
put it in something
that's obviously fireproof,

799
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,095
and then
take the yellow sandalwood

800
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,830
and sprinkle it on
so it'll smoke.

801
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:18,795
Mm-hmm.

802
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,999
This is used in exorcisms.

803
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:27,668
State the following
while you burn this --

804
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:31,437
"I am allowing you to follow
this smoke out of my home.

805
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,406
If you do not leave now,
you will be removed.

806
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:38,476
I am granting
all the power.

807
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,208
Leave now."

808
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:41,776
And what will that do?

809
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:46,947
Basically, she's opening a door
for the ones who want to leave.

810
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:48,482
Most of them
will want to go.

811
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:51,115
Yes. I do believe that.

812
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,352
Whoever chooses to stay,
they're gonna be pissed.
They know what's coming.

813
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:57,653
So, do you think this guy is
gonna be the last guy standing?

814
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,420
Yes.

815
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:03,790
So, the next thing
that needs to be done is,

816
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,892
you need to find a medium
and a holy person.

817
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:07,058
Hmm.

818
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,477
First, you're gonna
have the medium come.

819
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:11,895
Have that medium
do whatever they want

820
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,397
to remove
the remaining dead.

821
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:15,396
Okay.

822
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,133
Once the medium's done,
the next day,

823
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,800
you need to have a holy person
come

824
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:23,637
and bless the house
and then the ground.

825
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:27,603
You down with it?

826
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:30,139
Well,
if it'll help my wife.

827
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:33,274
Why don't we discuss
your skepticism?

828
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,778
Let's say I'm not as skeptical
as I claim to be,

829
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:40,879
I guess, but...

830
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,549
I don't like acknowledging it.

831
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,014
That might give --

832
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:51,520
If it does exist,
gives it more strength.

833
00:41:51,555 --> 00:41:53,156
- Is that true?
- No.

834
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:56,122
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

835
00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:59,075
Just treat this guy
like another perp.

836
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,958
He is. He is.
He's a burglar in the house.

837
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:04,194
You know, you want to bring
the fight to them, bring it.

838
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:05,862
Yep. Yes.
We're gonna do it.

839
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:07,294
Good.

840
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:10,198
AMY: Donna and Millard have
a tough fight ahead of them,

841
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,263
but I believe
if they follow my advice,

842
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:14,834
they'll be able to expel
the controlling man,

843
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,000
free his slaves,

844
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,569
and live a normal, peaceful life
with their son.
