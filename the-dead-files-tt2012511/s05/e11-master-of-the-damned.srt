1
-1:59:58,176 --> 00:00:01,477
It's awful, awful in here.

2
00:00:01,512 --> 00:00:05,547
This wolf-looking guy -- He went
"Raah!" right in my face.

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:07,479
I felt real fear.

4
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:10,584
In front of two witnesses,
he stabs him to death.

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,102
"I'm dying.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,551
I'm dying."

7
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:15,052
I know what I see.

8
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,119
Something's wrong.

9
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:17,855
And I know what I hear.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,340
He wants them to go.

11
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,791
He wants revenge.

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,226
It's really bad in here.

13
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,345
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,429
Something is not right.

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,995
I see dead people.

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,231
This person might have been
a serial killer.

17
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,098
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,931
You get those chills.

19
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:39,233
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:41,701
He is darkness.
He is evil.

21
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:44,738
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

22
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:46,605
I think she broke her neck.

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,090
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,506
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,641
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

26
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,140
You telling me the truth?

27
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:56,744
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,379
I think the devil
is down here.

29
00:00:58,414 --> 00:00:59,730
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,623
Who the hell
would do this?

31
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:03,447
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,449
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:06,783
...until the very end.

34
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,150
Who's he looking to kill?

35
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:10,319
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

36
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:12,454
You need to get out of here
right now.

37
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,554
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:16,123
It was like endless darkness.

39
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:39,671
STEVE: I always head to our
locations before Amy arrives.

40
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:42,940
I dig up facts
about the property's dark past

41
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,492
while Amy speaks to the dead.

42
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,974
I'm in Potsdam, New York.

43
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,744
It's about 30 minutes south
of the Canadian border.

44
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,196
We got called in
by a woman named Donna.

45
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,613
Like me, she's a retired
homicide detective.

46
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:58,549
She actually sounded embarrassed
needing our help,

47
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,400
but as a cop, I understand that.

48
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,182
Bottom line --
She and her family

49
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:04,417
are being terrorized by spirits
in the house.

50
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:07,721
And all her experience
can't help her solve this case.

51
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:18,893
MATTHEW: Before Amy arrives,

52
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,096
I clear the area
of any leading information.

53
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:24,781
This home
has a lot of family photos

54
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,899
that need to be covered
or removed.

55
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:29,665
When I'm finished,

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,935
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

57
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:54,449
I saw these men who were walking
like monkeys, like gorillas.

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,785
It just looks like
their, you know, skin

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,186
has been painted on black,

60
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:03,753
and they're barking
and growling.

61
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:09,024
One was saying that
they get used up or something,

62
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:13,027
and then they fall
into little dust.

63
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,060
He was a living person.

64
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,662
I don't know about the others.

65
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:24,968
They are protecting
certain things from being known.

66
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,109
STEVE: Now, Donna, you sounded
pretty upset on the phone.

67
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,978
And you're a former
homicide detective like myself.

68
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,813
I know it had to be tough
for you to even call us.

69
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,078
I've tried everything
I can do.

70
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,379
We've been terrorized here

71
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,447
with the things
that have been happening here.

72
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,583
Okay. So why don't you
tell me what's going on?

73
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:52,549
Well,
our son has seen things,

74
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,685
I've been woken up
and seen things,

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,051
and my skeptical husband

76
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,354
has even seen things
and been touched.

77
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,955
And how old is your son?

78
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,321
He's 17.

79
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:04,491
Latest apparition he saw,
he ran into my room screaming,

80
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,994
and that's why
I wrote you guys a letter.

81
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,427
I need a solution
'cause it's got to stop.

82
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,828
- You were a detective down
in south Florida, right? - Yes.

83
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,896
What brought you here?

84
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,866
I was born and raised up here,
and I left for 32 years.

85
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,133
And my son,
at the time, was 10.

86
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,133
And living in south Florida
with a child,

87
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,401
I wanted to bring him back
to a peaceful place.

88
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,371
You don't have to worry
about the criminal element here.

89
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,937
Right.

90
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,772
But you have to worry
about some other element now.

91
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,139
Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:34,043
I'm pissed off,
and the fight's on.

93
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,850
There's this living woman.

94
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:57,357
And she's saying that this home
is not working for her.

95
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:58,756
She hates it,

96
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:02,594
and she feels like this house
is, like, closing in on her.

97
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,328
She's probably an empath.

98
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,296
MATTHEW:
Why do you say that?

99
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:13,166
Her emotions --
She pushes them out of her.

100
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:17,002
There's a lot of anger
in this room from her.

101
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,470
Something's wrong.

102
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,042
So, Donna,
why'd you bring me in here?

103
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,641
We've had
a lot of bad luck.

104
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:33,412
A lot of freaky things with
the appliances breaking down.

105
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,711
They're all new appliances.

106
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:37,681
And we've been hit by lightning
here

107
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:40,581
not once, but twice
in seven years.

108
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,984
The odds on that
got to be astronomical.

109
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,085
It's like a magnet
or something.

110
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,218
We had a chimney fire

111
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:48,620
that caught the whole front yard
on fire.

112
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,686
That's crazy.

113
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,988
Anything else going on?

114
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,556
I sit over there,
watching TV,

115
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:58,391
and I see this blob
of a black shadow,

116
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,328
and I look to make sure
I'm not seeing things,

117
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:02,728
and it just moves so fast.

118
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,364
I've seen that
about five times recently.

119
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,332
When it moves,
it's pretty massive.

120
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,802
And you're sure it's not
something from outside coming in

121
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,501
to make you see this?

122
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,602
I'm positive,
'cause my dog has --

123
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:17,021
When he sees it,
he starts growling and barking.

124
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,405
And you get up to investigate,
and it's gone.

125
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,474
It's gone.

126
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:26,110
This is a very bad area.

127
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:30,847
Things happen here
to the living people

128
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,982
with these things.

129
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,047
And this family --

130
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:38,683
I think they think it's
shadow people, but it's not.

131
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:41,784
The painted creatures who were
acting like monkeys<i> outside</i>

132
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,222
are now projecting themselves as
shadow people<i> inside</i> the house.

133
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,190
Whoever's in control
of these things

134
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:49,123
wants them
to torment the living.

135
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,358
They, like --
They'll see them like that,

136
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,694
but then
they'll see them get up.

137
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,860
There's, like, this panic.

138
00:06:55,895 --> 00:07:00,431
Like, I hear a woman screaming
and running out of here.

139
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,369
So,
what's going on up here?

140
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:10,936
This is the worst of it.

141
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,072
I get woke up a lot
in the middle of the night.

142
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,338
Give me a for-instance.

143
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,574
Well, the other night,
I was sleeping,

144
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,107
and, all of a sudden,

145
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:22,277
right in my face
was this wolf-looking guy,

146
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:24,176
and he went "Raah!"
right in my face.

147
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,646
- You're not on medication
or anything, right? - No.

148
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,580
If you were back on the job,
talking to people,

149
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,049
and somebody told you
this story...

150
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,214
- I would think they're crazy.
- Right.

151
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:35,251
Which my husband probably
does think I'm crazy for.

152
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,985
And then another time,

153
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,356
I woke up about 3:00
in the morning for no reason.

154
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,622
I see this huge, big guy

155
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:47,224
standing on the side of the bed,
looking at me.

156
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,227
He was about
at least over 6 feet tall.

157
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,695
He didn't look like
he was happy.

158
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,331
He was kind of menacing.

159
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:05,870
I saw an older man
who was hiding things.

160
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:11,005
He's very condescending.

161
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,843
He has an elitist attitude
about everything.

162
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:19,010
He's very scary.

163
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,712
MATTHEW:
Is there any connection between
him and the painted people?

164
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:25,480
AMY: He put them to work
for him.

165
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:29,584
He painted them all black
and creepy-looking,

166
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:34,487
and he makes them
show themselves to people

167
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,320
and scare them.

168
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:40,723
And he does
take their energy.

169
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:44,060
When they're all used up,
they become like dust.

170
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:47,363
And what happens, then,
when they turn into dust?

171
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:49,798
They cease to be.

172
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,867
STEVE:
Now, is there anything else
you've seen up here?

173
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,002
Yeah, one night, I was up here
with a few friends,

174
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,752
and I felt something
behind me.

175
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,468
And I look,
and I see this arm.

176
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,836
It had a black sleeve,

177
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:05,306
the skinny old-lady fingers
with nails.

178
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,742
So, you just saw the arm,
not the --

179
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:08,706
Just saw the arm.

180
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:09,841
Where was it coming from?

181
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,241
It was coming
from behind me.

182
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,710
Okay, so, it was as if somebody
was behind you going like this?

183
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,147
Yeah, trying to get my attention
or, like, cutting me off.

184
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,614
Did you see the lady?

185
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:19,847
No.

186
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,533
Do you think there's evil
in this house?

187
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:25,185
I don't think
it's on the good side.

188
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,619
It wants us out of here.

189
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,355
Okay.

190
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:37,358
I think that this guy
has a little bit of a problem

191
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,226
with the people in this room

192
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,094
because they know about him.

193
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,728
He hates it.

194
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:45,298
So he wants them to go.

195
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,997
Ooh!

196
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:51,099
This is...Mmm.

197
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,969
This is not good, all right?

198
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,787
Oh, I don't like it.

199
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,230
Okay, just a sec.

MATTHEW: Are you okay?

203
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:05,175
I felt really, really scared.

204
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,978
It's, like, real fear.

205
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,456
STEVE: Andrew,
I was talking to mom,

206
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,859
and she told me about the things
that are going on in the house,

207
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,727
and she told me
you're having a tough time here.

208
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,829
Yeah. I've experienced
some things here.

209
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:39,061
In seventh grade,

210
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,731
I saw a shadow figure
dart across my front lawn.

211
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,031
Describe what you saw.

212
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,534
I saw, like,
a black-figured human being.

213
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:46,766
Okay.

214
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,935
Had you ever seen this thing
again?

215
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,669
Yeah, recently, actually.

216
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:52,302
I was coming home
from football,

217
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:53,572
and I came in the driveway,
and I saw it.

218
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:55,104
Really?

219
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,307
It kind of, like,
lifted its head up and ran.

220
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:59,209
Okay. So, now,
what about the house?

221
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,677
What have you experienced
in the house?

222
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:04,076
I was sleeping on this bed,
and I woke up,

223
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:08,180
and I saw a man dressed in an
army uniform standing over me.

224
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:10,013
- And he was just
staring at you? - Yeah.

225
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,917
Now, how long did this thing
last in front of you?

226
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,282
About two seconds,

227
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:16,352
and then I thought it was
a human being standing there,

228
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:17,651
so I kicked him in the face.

229
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,754
My foot went through his face,
and he disappeared.

230
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:20,953
That was it?

231
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,354
I ran out in the hallway,

232
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,190
and I kind of, like,
hyperventilated a little bit.

233
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,623
I don't like being here
alone.

234
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:31,027
All right, so, what do you
think's going on here?

235
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:34,396
Something doesn't want us here,
or I don't know.

236
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,330
Okay.

This older man I saw --

He is pissed,
because when he died,

239
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:52,307
he kind of lost control
over everything.

around the house,

he holds over the dead here.

Okay.

247
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:15,254
He says
that most of these people

248
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,320
were men when he met them.

249
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:20,790
I mean, they were dead men,
but they were men.

250
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:25,860
And he made them
what they are now.

251
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:31,364
He says, because he is superior
in every way,

252
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,799
that's why he's able
to dominate them.

253

When he was alive,
I think he was haunted by them,

254
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,604
and he flipped
that whole **** around.

255

I was talking
to your wife.

that you really don't

00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,614
I don't think
they're lying,

261
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,250
but I'm not seeing
what they're seeing,

there's something going on.

there's a cord with a tag on it.

One night,
I went up there to go lay down,

and before I went to lay down,
it flapped rapidly.

No.
That's the whole thing.

00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,100
Okay.

00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,170
And I thought to myself,
"Well, Donna might be right."

276
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,204
And before I went to sleep,
I said, "**** you,"

00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:40,672

00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,843
I was laying on the sofa,
trying to take a nap,

281

and I felt a vivid touch
on my face,

Yes.

Whatever was there that caused
that, I couldn't explain.

00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:18,128
I feel a lot of pain,
but it's not really --

No, pain isn't the right word.

292
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,830
It's pressure.

But he'll push on people, like,
squish them or shove them.

He doesn't like living people.

and he wants revenge.

The first thing I usually do
in these investigations

is try to find out
who lived on the property.

Turns out
one of the former owners

304

actually passed away
of a heart attack in the house.

00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,252
Okay.
How long did you live here?

From 1978 until 1983.

During your time here,

312
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,122
did you ever experience anything
you couldn't explain?

313
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,423
Not a thing.

314
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,459
I can't recall anything
ever strange happening here.

315

Your father died here,

316

and what'd your father do
for a living?

He had been in the service,
you know, in the Korean War.

00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:14,130
I brought a picture
to show in his uniform.

319
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:18,867
Then he was an insurance man
for a great many years,

320
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:23,404
and before he passed, he was a
manager at an auto-parts store.

321
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,537
Okay.

322
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:28,941
So, what kind of a guy
was your dad?

323
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,073
He was a tough guy.

324
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,675
It was either his way
or the highway.

325
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,861
Didn't show
a whole lot of emotion.

326
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:37,011
He was basically
a very strict dad.

327
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,479
What kind of a relationship
did you have with him?

328
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,112
I was always cautious.

329
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,814
He would get heated
pretty quickly.

330
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,250
Makes you be on eggshells.
I was, like, on eggshells a lot.

331
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,553
AMY:
I see that older man in here.

332
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:56,473
He doesn't like it
when people know about him.

333
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:59,358
It freaks him out.
It disturbs him. He hates it.

334
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,160
When he was alive,

335
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:05,495
he had control
over everything, every aspect,

336
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,330
and then he died
and, like, "Oh ****

337
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,331
He's dead."

338
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,665
I think it was unexpected death.

339
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,803
He didn't have any control,
and he got really mad.

340
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,372
What the **** is that about?

341
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,941
What kind of relationship
did your mom and dad have?

342
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,075
Well, they were together
a very long time.

343
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,610
They were
high-school sweethearts.

344
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:30,043
Okay.

345
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,610
But I think, you know,
before he passed,

346
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,546
it was probably a low point
of their relationship.

347
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:34,913
She wasn't home.

348
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,115
She wasn't here
when he had passed.

349
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,247
She was in Florida.

350
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,016
I don't think
that he was happy

351
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,050
about her going away
on vacation.

352
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:44,618
And before she went away,
he said, you know,

353
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,888
"I'm not gonna be around
that much longer, anyways.

354
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:48,856
I'm not gonna be living
that long."

355
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,256
Just like that?

356
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,623
Just like that.

357
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:56,026
Three days later, when she was
gone in Florida, he died.

358
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,826
She felt horrible.

359
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:00,596
It was so tragic
and such a shock.

360
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,331
Now, where did he die
in the house?

361
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,563
He died in the garage.

362
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,566
Okay.
Would you mind showing me?

363
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,420
Does it bother you
being in here?

364
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:16,169
It's very strange
being in here.

365
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,139
This is where
he took his last breath.

366
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,673
It was very hard
to come in here

367
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,575
and know that
this is where it happened.

368
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,874
Right.

369
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,311
And what year did he die?

370
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,344
He died in 1992.

371
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:28,679
Now,
was there any indication

372
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,648
that he had a heart problem
or a heart condition?

373
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:33,015
There was no signs.
There was nothing.

374
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:35,418
Who was the first family member
to come home?

375
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:36,449
I was.

376
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,034
You were?

377
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:37,584
Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,350
What did you see?

379
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:44,254
Well, I found over in this area
a small round circle of blood

380
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,424
where he had hit his head.

381
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,224
Did you clean it?

382
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,194
It's the first thing I did
after I pulled myself together.

383
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,493
It was important to me.

384
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:55,062
That's all I could focus on
was to go into the house

385
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:56,496
and to clean it up

386
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:58,698
'cause I didn't want my mom
to see that when she got home.

387
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,467
He died alone,
and that's just really tragic.

388
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,399
That's how my mom died, too,

389
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,620
and it bothered me
thinking about her dying alone.

390
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,806
When I came out here
and I found the spot of blood,

391
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:14,474
it just was --
It hit me full force.

392
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:15,342
Right.

393
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:16,176
He's gone.

394
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,545
MATTHEW:
Do you know how he died?

395
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:24,512
Some kind of, like,
aneurysm, sudden heart a--

396
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,747
you know,
sudden death, whatever.

397
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:30,183
You know, it was something
completely unexpected.

398
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:32,351
Do you know
when he was alive?

399
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:34,586
'80s, '90s.

400
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:49,463
I feel a pain -- back and
my neck -- pretty **** bad.

401
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,732
I feel anger and stress.

402
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,798
[ Sighs ] ****

403
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:03,303
When I'm hearing his thoughts,
I'm thinking I'm dying.

404
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,038
"I'm dying. I'm dying."

405
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,341

unexplained activity

and we'll help if we can.

410
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,153
STEVE: I need to find out

411
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:34,823
what else might have happened
on my client's property,

412
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,856
so I hit the books
at the local library.

413
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:41,059
Digging through old deeds, I
find a man named Frank Bancroft

414
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,159
originally owned Donna's land.

415
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,595
Turns out he was hit and killed
by a car

416
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,064
while walking back home.

417
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,433
Now that I know
a former owner of Donna's land

418
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:54,500
died in an accident,

419
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,333
I reached out
to a local genealogist.

420
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,137
He tells me that that tragedy
was only the beginning

421
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:01,906
of the Bancroft family's
problems on that property.

422
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,178
So, Dennis,
I came across this article

423
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:12,677
about this guy,
Frank Bancroft.

424
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:15,879
So, I was wondering, what do you
know about what happened to him?

425
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,313
He was intoxicated,

426
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,450
and he was
wandering down the road,

427
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,781
and he was struck by a car.

428
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:23,384
He died as a result
of a skull fracture

429
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,818
and some hemorrhaging,

430
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:27,021
of which
we have some information,

431
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,189
including
his death certificate.

432
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,490
This happens in 1937.

433
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,490
Yes.

434
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,376
This was actually
the second time

435
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,228
he was hit by a car
within two weeks.

436
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,460
Okay.

437
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,597
But he really didn't sustain
any injury that first time.

438
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:43,862
Well, what's the matter
with this guy?

439
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:47,032
He's walking down the street
and keeps getting hit by cars?

440
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:50,168
I think a lot of it has to do
with the passing of his wife.

441
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,170
In 1934, his wife passed
with pneumonia.

442
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:55,670
He just really
never got over it.

443
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,938
He got sort of despondent
and began drinking.

444
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:01,007
You weren't kidding
about bad luck with this guy.

445
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:01,973
Yes.

446
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:04,074
Later on, in 1932,

447
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,110
his horse barn
was hit by lightning

448
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,344
and destroyed.

449
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:11,081
Then, in 1935,
his house burned to the ground,

450
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:13,881
and he barely made it out
alive.

451
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:17,084
So, now, once Frank dies,
what happens to the property?

452
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,886
The property goes
to his only daughter, Hazel,

453
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,654
which we have a picture of her
when she was 12.

454
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,822
What did she do
with the property?

455
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,122
Do you have any idea?

456
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,524
In 1946, she had a boarder
named Frank Reninger

457
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,091
that was living there,

458
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,561
and one day,
he started beating on her,

459
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:35,060
and he almost killed her.

460
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,080
She finally escaped
by going down through the cellar

461
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:41,065
and out the side door
to the neighbor's to get help.

462
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:44,867
Now, is there any reason why
she got beat up by this guy?

463
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,702
I don't know
if anybody really knows.

464
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,068
Like, he snapped.

465
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,738
I would say that probably
would be what happened to him.

466
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,876
It's awful, awful...

467
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,478
awful, awful in here.

468
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:08,580
A lot of emotions in here --
desperate.

469
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:14,285
I heard screaming, too,
like, a female screaming.

470
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:19,855
I do see a woman,
and she's from a bit ago --

471
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,991
100 years ago, 125 years.

472
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,093
And she sits and cries.

473
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:30,861
She's in a nightdress,
she's got a nightcap on,

474
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:34,962
and she's just weeping
and weeping and weeping.

475
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:39,368
While she was gone, this Frank
set fire to her house,

476
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:41,602
and it destroyed the house.

477
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,837
We have
a little bit of information

478
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,638
on that particular fire.

479
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:50,023
I tell you, Dennis,
this is pretty wild stuff

480
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,308
because two houses
burned on their property

481
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,075
before my clients
even got there.

482
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,377
Their house was hit by lightning
twice in the last seven years.

483
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,245
Plus,
their chimney caught fire.

484
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,414
So you got two lightning strikes
in the last seven years

485
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,548
and two houses that burned down
on the property before that.

486
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,082
Actually, four houses.

487
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:06,282
Four houses?

488
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:09,568
One in 1901
and the other in 1911.

489
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:12,820
So, four times
houses burned down.

490
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:13,955
Yes.

491
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,090
STEVE: During my research,

492
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,190
I also uncovered a murder
that took place

493
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,960
just a short distance away
from Donna's house.

494
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,696
I'm on my way
to meet with a local historian,

495
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,063
who tells me
the crime was so brutal,

496
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:30,498
it had the whole town
in a frenzy.

497
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,870
So, now, this murder I came
across during my research --

498
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,105
It looked like
it was pretty prominent.

499
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,170
Yes.

500
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:46,806
The Donavan/Rowley case,
which was in 1852.

501
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:50,077
John Donavan and James Rowley
spend the evening drinking.

502
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:52,445
They start arguing
and get into a fight.

503
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:56,679
Friends kind of
calm them down,

504
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:59,965
make them shake hands
to be friendly,

505
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,216
and they depart
each other's company.

506
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,886
Donavan goes back in a bar
and starts drinking again.

507
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,987
A friend of Donavan's
starts telling him

508
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,821
how he should not
have apologized.

509
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:11,522
Okay, so, this guy
is instigating Donavan?

510
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,489
Yes.

511
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,323
And as Donavan drinks more,

512
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,891
he gets more worked up
about Rowley,

513
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:20,028
so he actually leaves the bar
with his knife

514
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:22,628
and goes
and hunts James Rowley down

515
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:24,964
and, in front of two witnesses,
stabs him to death

516
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,331
and kind of
disembowels him.

517
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:28,297
Ooh! Okay.

518
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:30,300
He's apprehended
that night,

519
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:32,703
and, the next day,
finds out what he did.

520
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:35,036
He has no recollection
of the murder,

521
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:38,639
so he showed a lot of remorse
after this in a trial

522
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:41,639
but was convicted
of first-degree murder.

523
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,209
All right, so, what winds up
happening that night?

524
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,709
He was hung
just outside the jail.

525
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,611
Between 1,200 and 1,500 people
attended the hanging.

526
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:57,416
AMY: Someone's talking
about the murders,

527
00:25:57,451 --> 00:26:03,821
and I'm seeing someone
getting stabbed to death.

528
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:11,126
There's someone wearing
a white button-down shirt,

529
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,258
a male,

530
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:13,927
and he's getting
stabbed to death.

531
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:18,495
Where is he being stabbed?

532
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,832
In his abdomen and chest.

533
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,303
During my walk,
I saw an angry man

534
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:34,339
who was in control of
the painted people in the house.

535
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:37,041
I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to draw him.

536
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:42,311
He's between 55 and 65.

537
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:44,210
He is balding.

538
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:48,046
He has deep-set eyes.

539
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:49,947
Next, I described a scene

540
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:52,783
where the painted people
were tormenting the living.

541
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:56,853
There's a thing.
He's been painted black.

542
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:00,754
He's using his hands.

543
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:03,189
And he was reaching out
for her.

544
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:07,326
It was just
a very freaky kind of scene.

545
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,697
Is this what you saw?

546
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,532
Yes.

547
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,415
STEVE: Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

548
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,248
we're ready
to reveal our findings

549
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,385
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

550
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,518
Amy,
I'd like you to meet Donna.

551
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:55,471
Now, Donna is a retired
homicide detective like myself,

552
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:58,390
so when she called us in,
I knew things had to be serious,

553
00:27:58,425 --> 00:27:59,675
and, actually, they are.

554
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,890
She's being terrorized

555
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,692
by the things
that are going on in this house.

556
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:04,192
This is her husband, Millard.

557
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:07,429
He's had a few experiences,
but he remains a skeptic.

558
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:10,631
One thing they both agree on
is they're fighting mad.

559
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,598
They're not gonna let
whatever's here

560
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,931
drive them out of their house.

561
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,817
With that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

562
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,668
and have her tell us
about her walk.

563
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:22,339
AMY: So I was out
in the front yard,

564
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,872
and I overhear two women
gossiping.

565
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:27,241
One woman is saying,
"Oh, my," you know,

566
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,241
"Did you hear
about the murders?"

567
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:33,011
One of the victims that I saw
was a male,

568
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,747
and someone
was stabbing him to death

569
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:41,414
in the abdomen/chest area.

570
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:44,118
Now I didn't think
this would have came into play,

571
00:28:44,153 --> 00:28:46,787
but there was a homicide
that took place in 1852...

572
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:48,218
...on your property.
- Okay.

573
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,354
Two guys got into a fight
in a bar.

574
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,188
People that see it break it up,

575
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:54,591
and they make them shake hands
and quiet down.

576
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:55,956
One guy's name
was John Donavan.

577
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,626
The other guy's name
was James Rowley.

578
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,592
Rowley leaves the bar,

579
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:02,428
and John Donavan stays
and continues to drink.

580
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:03,627
A friend of his comes up

581
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,430
and starts egging him on,
saying, "You know what?

582
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:07,199
You should have never
apologized to that guy.

583
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,417
You should have
stood your ground."

584
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,566
Now, he eggs him on to the point

585
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,567
where he goes out,
finds him on the street,

586
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:16,737
and he stabs him a few times
in the chest and the stomach.

587
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,405
He stabs him so bad,
he disemboweled him.

588
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,407
Donavan was actually hanged
for that homicide.

589
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:24,543
Wow.

590
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:29,877
What else did you see?

591
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:33,981
I came inside,
walked around the first floor,

592
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:37,217
and I got
that a living woman here

593
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,983
was mad and angry,

594
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:42,118
and I was hearing her say

595
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:46,756
how much she hates the house
and how she feels trapped,

596
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,222
like the home
is crushing her.

597
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:55,426
And this female
seems to be empathic.

598
00:29:55,461 --> 00:30:02,332
So this anger and hatred
actually fills the atmosphere.

599
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:06,717
Well,
does it sound like you?

600
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:09,534
It does sound like me.
Yeah.

601
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:14,039
Like, sometimes,
I can feel when people are sick.

602
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:18,008
And it comes
without any warning.

603
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,526
Okay.

604
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,010
Not good.

605
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,913
Oh, my gosh.

606
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:31,350
What else was going on
during your walk?

607
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:34,382
At one point,
I went upstairs.

608
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:39,037
I went into, I guess,
the master bedroom.

609
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:43,657
And I felt extremely intense
feeling of fear.

610
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:47,591
After the fear came in,
sadness.

611
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:53,395
Then I saw this old woman,

612
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,265
and she was just rocking
and, like, moaning and crying.

613
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,867
It seemed like it was
about 100 to 125 years ago,

614
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,502
just by the way
she was dressed.

615
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,636
Tell Amy what you saw.

616
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:10,106
You were talking about
the old woman's arm.

617
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:12,372
Well,
I felt something behind me,

618
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:17,476
and then I saw this skinny arm
with a black sleeve

619
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:19,843
with these long nails,

620
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,411
just going like this
behind me.

621
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,347
I'm like, "What the heck?"
And I turn around.

622
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,716
There's nothing there.

623
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,015
This may be a long shot,

624
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,951
but a woman that used to
live on this property

625
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:32,853
had a pretty tragic time here.

626
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:35,686
Her name is Hazel Bancroft.

627
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:39,424
Her mother, Harriet,
died of pneumonia back in 1934.

628
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,591
Now in 1937,
after the mother died,

629
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,125
her dad, Frank --

630
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,496
He gets hit by a car one night
and ends up dying, as well.

631
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,161
Oh, my God.

632
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:53,966
So, now, the daughter winds up
taking over the property.

633
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:57,466
1946, she's got a boarder
who's 68 years old,

634
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:00,102
and she just comes home
from the market or something.

635
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,869
He meets her at the door,

636
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:05,273
and he starts beating the hell
out of her for no reason.

637
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:07,308
She literally escaped
with her life

638
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,226
by running out
the back of the house,

639
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,074
down in the basement
and then and out.

640
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,444
Once she escapes,
the guy burned the house down.

641
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,110
Wow.

642
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:17,347
Now, could the woman
you were talking about

643
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:20,514
been either her
or maybe her mother?

644
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,315
Possibly her mother.

645
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,185
By the way, that was the fourth
house to burn on this property.

646
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,720
I mean,
these are some of the articles.

647
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:33,455
1901, 1911, and 1935,

648
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,024
houses were all burned down
on this property.

649
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,559
Did you know anything
about these fires at all?

650
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:40,491
Absolutely not.
No.

651
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,429
They've had their house
hit by lightning twice

652
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:43,761
in the seven years
they're here,

653
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,762
and you also had a chimney fire,
right? - Yes.

654
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,966
So, now you have four houses
burnt to the ground...

655
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,465
...on this property.
- Right.

656
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,568
Your house has been hit twice
with lightning,

657
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,068
and you had the chimney fire.

658
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,571
And if we weren't home,
it wouldn't be here today.

659
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,872
[ Sighs ]

660
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:01,807
There's no such thing
as coincidence

661
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,609
when you have this many.

662
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,376
Yeah, I agree with that.

663
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:09,443
So, how'd the rest of the walk
go?

664
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:15,515
Well, the most powerful entity
that I met in the house

665
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:21,552
was this older dead man
who was very condescending.

666
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,887
[ Sighs ]
He talks too **** fast.

667
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,486
[ Scoffs ]

668
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:29,755
And he calls me a dimwit.

669
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:31,991
He's like, "Keep up."

670
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,191
He was very controlling.

671
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:36,492
In fact,
he's a control freak.

672
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:39,578
But here's the thing --
The way that he died

673
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:42,630
was maybe an aneurysm
or a heart attack,

674
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:44,998
and this really upset him

675
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:48,868
because it was something
that was out of his control.

676
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,836
And this was probably
in the '80s or '90s.

677
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:52,569
[ Scoffs ]

678
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:55,905
He is upset
with living people

679
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,807
because he feels like
when he died,

680
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,042
he was very disrespected.

681
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,927
Well, I think I know
who you're talking about.

682
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,846
There's a guy
that died in this house in 1992.

683
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,180
The name of Cleave Lytle.

684
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,351
He died unexpected, died
of a heart attack in the garage.

685
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,184
Great.

686
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,018
Now, I talked to his daughter,
Betsy.

687
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:21,054
She described him as a "My way
or the highway" type of guy.

688
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:25,589
He was not very warm,
not affectionate.

689
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,927
Now, I got photos of him.

690
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,579
He was actually in the army.

691
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,762
He was in the army.
Wow.

692
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:39,132
Your son said he saw somebody
in an army uniform

693
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,667
standing over his bed, right?

694
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:42,167
He sure did, plain as day.

695
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,369
Our son,
he's always scared.

696
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,205
Just the other night,
he was yelling in his sleep

697
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,273
and came out walking
like he was in a daze,

698
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,841
and he doesn't
even remember that.

699
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,472
That was just the other day.

700
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,744
Oh. I'm glad he's not sitting here
to look at that.

701
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:03,247
And here's a couple of pictures
of him years later.

702
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:07,547
Wow.

703
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:11,853
I did do a sketch,
but I saw no hair on top.

704
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,156
Wow.
Take a look at that.

705
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,760
Oh, my God.

706
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:30,930
Mm.
It could pass for him, yes.

707
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:36,834
That's definitely him.
The eyes are right on.

708
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,400
What's this guy's story?

709
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:44,706
He is kind of a leader
of about 25 other dead men.

710
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,440
Oh, boy.

711
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:51,510
And what he did to them was,
he painted their skin black,

712
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:56,379
and he makes them
kind of move like a gorilla,

713
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,614
and they'll bark
like a dog.

714
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:00,715
It's very strange.

715
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,747
He uses their energy,

716
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:06,752
and he'll use it so much
that he literally uses them up,

717
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:08,453
and then they turn to dust

718
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:10,120
and cease to even be
anymore.

719
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,753
Oh, my God.

720
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:14,256
He makes them
frighten the living.

721
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,425
The living people would probably
perceive them as shadow men,

722
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,426
but they're not.

723
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:21,692
Oh, my God.

724
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:23,560
Now, you've mentioned...

725
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,894
...you've seen shadow figures
in the kitchen. - In the kitchen.

726
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,880
You look out
of the corner of your eye,

727
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:30,507
and you see something
about 6 foot tall,

728
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:33,100
and I go to look, and it...
Away it goes.

729
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:36,370
And I've seen that several times
recently.

730
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:40,139
I did a sketch
of what I saw.

731
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,175
Ooh.

732
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,709
What the ****

733
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:51,312
I don't know if you're gonna
want to see this.

734
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,280
Oh, my God.

735
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,850
This is exactly
how I see that.

736
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,985
**** exactly
how I see that.

737
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:18,428
AMY: I did a sketch
of what I saw.

738
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,429
What the ****

739
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,965
I don't know if you're gonna
want to see this.

740
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,933
DONNA: Oh, my God.

741
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:30,502
This is exactly
how I see that.

742
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:33,637
**** exactly
how I see that.

743
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,574
So, they're not shadow people,
like you --

744
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:40,540
No.

745
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:41,607
Real people.

746
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,477
Yeah, they're enslaved.

747
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,011
Oh, my God.

748
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:45,977
Wow.

749
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:48,544
That's crazy.

750
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:50,380
So, where are these people
coming from?

751
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:53,515
Well, they're -- I don't know.
He collected them.

752
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,452
He just makes them kind of
**** with the living people.

753
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:58,784
Can we **** with him?

754
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,520
Yeah,
can we **** with him?

755
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:02,188
I think so.

756
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:03,521
- Good.
- Yeah. - Game on.

757
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:05,457
They just make you
anxious and scared,

758
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,289
and they'll mess around.

759
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:10,293
But he got that he could
interact with the living.

760
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:13,479
He can blind you
through migraines,

761
00:38:13,514 --> 00:38:16,906
cause hallucinations,
fear and panic.

762
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:20,299
He likes to bother and/or scare
children.

763
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,332
Nice.

764
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,634
He can touch
by, like, shaking, pushing down,

765
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,301
feeling smothered --
things like that.

766
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:29,037
Now, you said he could
cause hallucinations, right?

767
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,337
Yes.

768
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:32,606
Tell Amy what you saw
in your bedroom.

769
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,439
When I first moved in,

770
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:39,043
I got woke up
by this horrible wolf thing.

771
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:41,778
Now, is that what he's capable
of doing, what she's describing?

772
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,981
I think so, yeah.
Absolutely.

773
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,482
You got touched.

774
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:46,913
I felt I did, yes.

775
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:48,147
Tell Amy what happened.

776
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:50,116
MILLARD: On the sofa,
I couldn't go to sleep.

777
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,985
I felt a vivid finger.

778
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,283
Poke you?

779
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,387
Not hard, not painful,
nothing -- Just, it was there.

780
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,688
STEVE: What does he want?

781
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:03,657
He wants control
and to dominate.

782
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:07,593
He would probably prefer
no living people around here.

783
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:10,863
Now, how's it feel knowing that
somebody doesn't want you here?

784
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:12,895
**** him.

785
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,299
So he can move out
to the **** yard.

786
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:21,570
Well, you two said
you were up for a fight.

787
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,035
Looks like you got one
on your hands.

788
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,572
The big question is, is it safe
for you guys to stay here?

789
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,924
And is it safe for your son
to stay here?

790
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,241
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

791
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,212
So, there's a few things
that you're going to have to do.

792
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,279
The first thing

793
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,949
is to get rid of the people
that are inside the house.

794
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,068
This is their chance
to leave nicely.

795
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:50,945
So, what you're gonna do
is take this.

796
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,788
This is, like,
quick-lighting charcoal.

797
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:56,589
So, you can break it up
into four pieces,

798
00:39:56,624 --> 00:40:01,359
put it in something
that's obviously fireproof,

799
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,095
and then
take the yellow sandalwood

800
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,830
and sprinkle it on
so it'll smoke.

801
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:07,795
Mm-hmm.

802
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,999
This is used in exorcisms.

803
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,668
State the following
while you burn this --

804
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:20,437
"I am allowing you to follow
this smoke out of my home.

805
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:23,406
If you do not leave now,
you will be removed.

806
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:27,476
I am granting
all the power.

807
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,208
Leave now."

808
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,776
And what will that do?

809
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:35,947
Basically, she's opening a door
for the ones who want to leave.

810
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:37,482
Most of them
will want to go.

811
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:40,115
Yes. I do believe that.

812
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,352
Whoever chooses to stay,
they're gonna be pissed.
They know what's coming.

813
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,653
So, do you think this guy is
gonna be the last guy standing?

814
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:48,420
Yes.

815
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:52,790
So, the next thing
that needs to be done is,

816
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,892
you need to find a medium
and a holy person.

817
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,058
Hmm.

818
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:58,477
First, you're gonna
have the medium come.

819
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:00,895
Have that medium
do whatever they want

820
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,397
to remove
the remaining dead.

821
00:41:03,432 --> 00:41:04,396
Okay.

822
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,133
Once the medium's done,
the next day,

823
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,800
you need to have a holy person
come

824
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,637
and bless the house
and then the ground.

825
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:16,603
You down with it?

826
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:19,139
Well,
if it'll help my wife.

827
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:22,274
Why don't we discuss
your skepticism?

828
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:26,778
Let's say I'm not as skeptical
as I claim to be,

829
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:29,879
I guess, but...

830
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,549
I don't like acknowledging it.

831
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:34,014
That might give --

832
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:40,520
If it does exist,
gives it more strength.

833
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,156
- Is that true?
- No.

834
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:45,122
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

835
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:48,075
Just treat this guy
like another perp.

836
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,958
He is. He is.
He's a burglar in the house.

837
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:53,194
You know, you want to bring
the fight to them, bring it.

838
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:54,862
Yep. Yes.
We're gonna do it.

839
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:56,294
Good.

840
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:59,198
AMY: Donna and Millard have
a tough fight ahead of them,

841
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,263
but I believe
if they follow my advice,

842
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:03,834
they'll be able to expel
the controlling man,

843
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,000
free his slaves,

844
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:07,569
and live a normal, peaceful life
with their son.
