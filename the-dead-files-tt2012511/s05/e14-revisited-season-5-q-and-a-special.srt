1
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,376
Stop it.

2
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,413
In this special edition

3
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,547
of "The Dead Files"...

4
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:19,021
I didn't really comprehend
what I was doing.

5
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,422
And I flipped out.

6
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:22,858
...Steve and Amy
answer your questions...

7
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:25,430
Do you ever worry about
being physically attacked?

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,499
- The banshee lady
wanted to kill me. -

9
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,070
...revealing
their most shocking moments...

10
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,174
She just wanted to die.
That's how bad it was.

11
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,909
- ...and their greatest fears.

12
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:35,977
Amy?

13
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:37,881
That week,
I ended up in the hospital,

14
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,851
having to have
blood transfusions.

15
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,751
A lot of physical mediums
die young.

16
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:44,656
It's Steve and Amy
like never before.

17
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,159
That first episode,
I was hesitant even
going out there.

18
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:51,066
She didn't strike me as somebody
that could talk to dead people.

19
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:52,400
You've asked.

20
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:55,772
Is there one case in particular
that hit you the hardest?

21
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,374
They answer.

22
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:00,379
That one entity
was so powerful,

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,618
he had caused
so much horror.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,199
Hi. I'm Jim Casey,

25
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:18,137
the creator and one of
the executive producers

26
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,437
of "The Dead Files,"

27
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,440
and I'm sitting here with the
two stars of the show,

28
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,410
Amy Allan and Steve Di Schiavi,

29
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:26,381
who have taken a break
before their next investigation

30
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:27,950
to answer some fan questions.

31
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:29,785
Now, what I want
to know first is,

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,758
what question do you guys
get asked most often?

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,929
Did I ever have
a paranormal experience?

34
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,932
If I had a dollar
for every one of those,

35
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,900
we'd be on an island
doing this interview.

36
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:40,936
And what's the answer?

37
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,069
No.

38
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:44,806
I mean, everybody
wants to know why.

39
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,045
I'm like, "Not everybody has
a paranormal experience," right?

40
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:50,817
Some people are
more closed than others.

41
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm pretty closed.

42
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,588
Amy, how about you?
What question do you
get asked the most?

43
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:57,692
People ask me what's going on
at their house.

44
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:00,295
I can't answer them

45
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,197
unless I do
an investigation there.

46
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:06,137
I can't give general answers
to those types of questions.

47
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:09,308
Well, we actually get
a lot of questions

48
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,043
about Amy's abilities.

49
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,382
Savannah wants to know,
"Amy, when did you first know

50
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,084
that you could see
and talk to the dead?"

51
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,342
I have been able to do it
since I was a child,

52
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:25,790
but I didn't really comprehend
what I was doing

53
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,934
really until I was maybe
in my teenage years.

54
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,043
It was like this moment
of complete realization,

55
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,443
and I flipped out.

56
00:02:35,478 --> 00:02:38,180
And then I really went
on a quest

57
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:42,255
to figure out if I was insane,
if this was real.

58
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,654
Okay.

59
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,293
Nicole writes, "Amy,
at the beginning of the case

60
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,465
"at Plan B, the restaurant
in Asbury Park, New Jersey,

61
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,603
you start to explain how
you communicate with the dead."

62
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,709
When I encounter the dead,

63
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,874
I am seeing them

64
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,714
just like I'm interacting
with a living person.

65
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,519
But I might be communicating
with residual energy,

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,625
or I might be communicating
with dead people.

67
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,696
That's what I've always been
trying to find out.

68
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:18,571
"Can you tell me more about how
and what you see and hear?"

69
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:21,173
It depends on the location.

70
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:26,249
If there's a good, cool dead
person who's willing to chat,

71
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:29,151
then they look like,
you know, physical.

72
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,522
They're just there.
They're just talking to me.

73
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,858
They look like you.
You know, it's all good.

74
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,999
If there's not
or they're being jerks,

75
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,835
they might not look
as physical.

76
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:42,570
They might run away,

77
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:46,209
And then there's times
where there's no dead people,

78
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,777
and then it's more like,
you know,

79
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,382
I'll utilize some of my psychic
abilities, like psychometry,

80
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,271
and that's when, you know,
I might be touching things,

81
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:58,126
and then I see pictures
in my mind of what's going on.

82
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:06,137
There was a -- a big event.

83
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:09,040
Someone's lost...

84
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:12,846
and people are running all over
inside the house.

85
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,481
There's, panic.

86
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:18,119
Why are sometimes
things not not so clear?

87
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:21,758
Sometimes it's like I'm standing
there in the middle of a room

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,599
and I'm surrounded by, you know,
this throng of people

89
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,334
who are just yelling out

90
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,638
all of these various things
about themselves.

91
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:35,111
And, you know, I'm just trying
to do the best job I can

92
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,546
as far as figuring out

93
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:41,653
who is the person
I should be focusing on.

94
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:46,327
And I'm also typically yelling
at them to line up, and --

95
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,464
You know,
there's a lot more going on

96
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,500
than, you know,
what people see.

97
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:51,952
You had told me once before

98
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,335
that, like,
once they find out

99
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,239
that you can actually see
and talk to them,

100
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,674
they're kind of like,
"My God,

101
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,375
we've got somebody
we can actually talk to."

102
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,580
So, you know, it's like, "Hey."
You know, it's like --

103
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:01,582
It's like a mob.

104
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:02,514
Right. Exactly.

105
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,751
And you're trying to make sense
of what happened...

106
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,821
...and you're getting 50 stories
at the same time. - Right.

107
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:10,661
Steve, you're a former Marine.
You're a former cop.

108
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:13,097
You're a former
homicide detective.

109
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:14,332
Yes.

110
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,305
You've spent much of your life
helping the living.

111
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,972
Yeah.
Yeah, for the most part.

112
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,911
But I have a question for you
here from Laura,

113
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:25,815
who wants to know,
"It's unusual for a detective

114
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,485
"to be involved
with the paranormal.

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,354
How did you first
get involved with it?"

116
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,189
Well, you approached me
about doing this.

117
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:34,294
And you know
how hesitant I was.

118
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:35,460
I do.

119
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,532
You know, but I've always
been interested --

120
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,732
If there was a paranormal,

121
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,701
if there is supernatural stuff
going on.

122
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:43,272
Because I've never
had an experience,
I could never believe it.

123
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,643
But then we did the show
in Denver with Amy

124
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,212
called "The Lost Episode."

125
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,281
It's on the Travel Channel's
website for "The Dead Files."

126
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:55,156
It was like 2:00 a.m.,
and I felt this presence

127
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:56,222
right behind me,

128
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,459
right over my shoulder,
you know?

129
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,431
I could just tell it was --
It was some kind of energy.

130
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,366
- Were you alone in the house?
- Totally alone.

131
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:06,272
No one was here,
just this overwhelming feeling.

132
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:08,674
That first episode,

133
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,144
I was hesitant
even going out there.

134
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,511
Then when I met her,
you know.

135
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,382
Well, I'd never met anybody
that talks to dead people.

136
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,218
I've worked with a couple
of psychics on the job before,

137
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,537
but they didn't have
your abilities.

138
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:17,880
And I wasn't impressed
with them.

139
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,270
They, you know --
They were useless.

140
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,832
They never gave me a lead
or anything.

141
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,360
But then when I saw
her abilities,

142
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:23,761
I was, like, blown away.

143
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:26,566
Was there a single moment
in that case?

144
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,902
Well, the sketch
was huge for me.

145
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,073
Now, this is Amy's sketch
of the girl.

146
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,277
I haven't seen it yet,
myself.

147
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,117
Wow.

148
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,186
I mean,
the sketch was so close

149
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,458
to the girl that was murdered
in the house,

150
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,893
you know,
there was no denying it.

151
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,932
So, after doing the show,
are you still a skeptic?

152
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,937
I'm skeptical. I'm open-minded,
but I'm skeptical.

153
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,937
I believe in Amy's abilities.

154
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:58,844
She's as accurate
as anybody could be.

155
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:00,579
And I know for a fact
she doesn't know

156
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:03,118
any of the information
beforehand or where we're going.

157
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,020
Amy, at the Merchants Cafe
in Seattle, Washington,

158
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:09,593
you encountered an entity
that told you her name was Mary.

159
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,929
This religious woman,

160
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,034
she feels women are weak
and thus sickly.

161
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,168
What does she do?

162
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,705
I think
she **** kills them.

163
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,375
Do you get a name on her?

164
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,609
Mary?

165
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,146
Gina wants to know,

166
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:28,085
"Why don't entities
always tell you their names?"

167
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,821
Sometimes
they don't remember.

168
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,692
Names don't seem to be
that important

169
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:33,827
to a lot of dead people.

170
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,694
I'm not sure why,

171
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,865
but it's, like,
kind of not their --

172
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,500
who they are
or something.

173
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,939
It's a really strange thing
that I've been told by them --

174
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,174
by some of them.

175
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,480
But some of them who are still
very much attached to life

176
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,015
will, you know, still carry
their names with them.

177
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,053
You know, you have this much
time and it goes this fast,

178
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:56,057
and it's like, you know,
"I was murdered here with an ax,

179
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,327
and here I am,
and I can describe him," so...

180
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,428
They just want to tell you

181
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,582
what they feel is
the most important thing.

182
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,666
People wonder why
we're not hearing you,

183
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,637
you know, actually having
a verbal conversation

184
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:08,075
with somebody that's not there,
that we can't see.

185
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,443
- So it's actually going through
a thought process? - Right.

186
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,081
And I've always
wondered that myself.

187
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,313
- So it's like a telepathy.
- Yes.

188
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,451
Okay.
That answers that question.

189
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,253
Telepathy with the dead.

190
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,091
Now, Moses from the restaurant
in Asbury Park, New Jersey,

191
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,959
he was a special case,

192
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:25,232
because he was living,
yet you saw him.

193
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,298
How did that work?

194
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,055
His energy is here.

195
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,742
It's very, very solid energy.

196
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:38,617
But it's not like
I'm talking to him.

197
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,685
His energy is here,

198
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,755
but do you know
if he is dead himself?

199
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,392
I don't think so.

200
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,014
You know,
what had happened there,

201
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,567
whether he'll admit it
or not,

202
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:55,674
was an extremely emotional,
life-changing moment.

203
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,478
Part of him
is still there.

204
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,744
From the murder?

205
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,383
Because he killed someone
violently in that house...

206
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,918
...there's a piece of him
that remained? - Yes.

207
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,958
You also had him show up
at the sketch.

208
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:08,992
Yes.

209
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:12,930
He's right there.

210
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:17,037
And he's yelling at me
to shut the **** up.

211
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,774
****

212
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,610
Why did he show up?

213
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,413
He didn't want me
to sketch him.

214
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,117
What did he do?
How did he try to stop it?

215
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,688
Um, he was yelling at me
and calling me names,

216
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,055
trying to intimidate me.

217
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,394
And this is somebody
that's living.

218
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,493
Yeah.

219
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:35,962
That's the bizarre part
for me.

220
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,434
Was it tough for you
to sit across the table

221
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,567
and interview Moses?

222
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,637
Did you want to kill him,

223
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,973
or did you just
want to make a point

224
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,912
by hitting him upside the head
with a hammer?

225
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,364
Just make a point.
"Don't touch me."

226
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,781
You made your point
9 or 10 times.

227
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:50,048
You know that, right?

228
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,154
That was a tough interview
for me, doing the show.

229
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,088
Kind of got under my skin
a little bit.

230
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:57,827
It took a lot for me not to go
across the table at this guy,

231
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:01,499
because he's just so flippant
about the murder he did.

232
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,601
I think he gave us
the slightest glimpse

233
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,939
into what your life was like
when you were on the job.

234
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,642
Right. It took me back.

235
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,347
Made me miss it a little,
actually.

236
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,547
Next...

237
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:16,218
The banshee lady
wanted to kill me.

238
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:19,124
...can the dead
really harm the living?

239
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,657
I ended up
in the hospital,

240
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:21,728
having to have
blood transfusions.

241
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:23,930
And later, Steve shares

242
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,165
one of his darkest moments
from "The Dead Files."

243
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,672
It was just the worst
nightmare of a movie
that you can think of.

244
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,973
So, Ross wants to know,

245
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:58,946
"What are the common mistakes
that people make

246
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,682
when they're trying
to contact the dead?"

247
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,183
Well, the first thing is

248
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:06,122
you really shouldn't be
going out of your way

249
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,422
to contact the dead.

250
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,627
Typically,
you're gonna be getting

251
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,596
a whole mess
of crazy people

252
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,531
who have
nothing to do with you

253
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:16,103
and decide that they want to
mess with your life.

254
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:18,371
So, again,
the suggestion is,

255
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,276
please don't try
to go out of your way

256
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:22,811
to contact the dead.

257
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,446
If you're having a problem

258
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,235
getting over the death
of a loved one

259
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,989
and you feel compelled
to reach out,

260
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,823
go to a medium,

261
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,363
then try to go through
the process of grieving

262
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,598
and letting them go.

263
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,135
All right, Steve,
I got a question for you

264
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,122
from Frederick,
who wants to know,

265
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:43,074
"Do you wish
you had Amy's gift?"

266
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,307
No.

267
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,178
No. I don't even
have to think about that.

268
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,014
I got enough problems
with the real people.

269
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,318
I got to worry about
dead people, too?

270
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,384
No. I'm good.

271
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,887
You do have your own gift.

272
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,557
- You have a sixth sense
of your own. - Yes.

273
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:01,165
- You have this ability to really be able
to read people. - Yeah.

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,906
And how has that helped you
in paranormal cases?

275
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,340
I approach paranormal cases

276
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:10,178
like I would approach a homicide
or any investigation.

277
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:12,581
I don't believe anybody
till I talk to them,

278
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,749
and then
they got to convince me

279
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:17,355
that that they're telling me
the truthful statement.

280
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,490
I've been doing this
a very long time,

281
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,260
so I'm able to pick up on
when people are lying.

282
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:22,527
I can tell right away.

283
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:25,898
A perfect example is Logan,
in Olalla, Washington.

284
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,437
What's going on that you need us
to come in and investigate?

285
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:30,941
Well, I've heard whispering,
and I've been seeing things.

286
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,174
I had some friends over,

287
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,395
and we went to the other house
and did a séance

288
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,582
and we tried to communicate
with the spirits

289
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,750
and kind of talk
to them, but...

290
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:41,488
I'm afraid that
I set something in motion

291
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,524
that I don't understand,
and I called you guys here

292
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,027
'cause I'm hoping
you can put a stop to it.

293
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,995
He had done some séances,
or --

294
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,000
His first words were,
"a séance or maybe two."

295
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,240
And I knew there was something
not right with that answer,

296
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,308
so I pushed him
a little bit on it.

297
00:12:56,343 --> 00:13:00,080
This is the room
where I did the séance.

298
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,417
And this was the first time
you did a séance?

299
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:03,316
Yes.

300
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:05,691
- You sure?
- Yes.

301
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,661
I did have a couple more
after that, though.

302
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,061
How many more?

303
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:14,735
I kind of lost track.
I think I did 10.

304
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:17,839
So, Logan,
let me get this straight.

305
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:18,905
You did 10?

306
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,509
Somewhere around 10,
15 séances.

307
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,579
Logan, you told me
you did one séance.

308
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,648
Then you told me
you did 10.

309
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,252
Then I got you to tell me
you did 15.

310
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,090
I can't help you
unless you tell me the truth.

311
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,692
So, what's the number?

312
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,299
I've done 17 séances.

313
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,333
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

314
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,339
You might have bit off
more than you could chew.

315
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:47,647
So, that's how it helps us,
because me getting the truth,

316
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,616
the way I get the truth
out of people,

317
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,250
I can give her
the whole story,

318
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:54,257
and I think that's what
we both bring to the table.

319
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,925
So, Steve, how can you tell
the difference

320
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,125
between somebody
lying to you

321
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,295
and maybe just holding back
a little bit?

322
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,015
Well, it's almost
the same thing.

323
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,993
You know
that something's not right.

324
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:05,067
So, the tells are the same.
Whether --

325
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,772
Then I'll find out
if it was a lie,

326
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,443
or if it's just
they didn't to tell me,

327
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:09,611
they were afraid
to say something.

328
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,646
Like Marcus in New Orleans.

329
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,915
When I was here
in my bedroom,

330
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,520
I heard some footsteps
going up and down the stairs.

331
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,323
What other stuff
besides something like that?

332
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,324
You just heard footsteps?

333
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,830
- That's about it.
- Okay.

334
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,300
So, Marcus, listen.
I've seen and heard it all.

335
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,937
I've been in some scary,
scary places, all right?

336
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,403
Don't be afraid
to talk to me.

337
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,876
I'm here to investigate
and find out what's going on
in this house.

338
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,712
So, if there's something
you want to talk to me about,

339
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:35,915
you can tell me, okay?

340
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,118
So, um...

341
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,089
anything else
that happened up in here?

342
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,326
Um...

343
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,061
Yeah.

344
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:51,770
Once, I saw this woman
in a white dress,

345
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:57,444
like, walking
up and down the stairs.

346
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,711
He was a young kid.

347
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,582
I didn't think he was lying,
but then he opened up...

348
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,383
...and told me something he never
even told his mother. - Right.

349
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:03,919
I have a good way

350
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,590
of making people feel
comfortable talking to me,

351
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,161
which is very key
when you're doing interviews.

352
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:11,164
If you can't make somebody
comfortable

353
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,097
talking to you
about everyday stuff,

354
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:15,536
how are they gonna talk to you
about serious stuff?

355
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,872
Now, Amy,
you went head-to-head

356
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:21,310
with what you called a banshee
at Smalley's Inn.

357
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:24,748
You've said many times
that the dead will kill you,

358
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,852
the dead
will make you sick.

359
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,824
Kathy asks, "If an entity
or a dead person

360
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:32,459
"is trying to harm you,

361
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,631
will it sometimes show up
as something else?"

362
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,770
A heart attack, heart failure --
How does that work?

363
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,473
The banshee lady
wanted to kill me,

364
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,877
and that week,
I ended up in the hospital,

365
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,879
having to have
blood transfusions.

366
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,251
So yes, it can manifest
in a physical manner.

367
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,687
A lot of physical mediums
die young

368
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:55,223
from heart attack,
aneurysms,

369
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:58,129
cancers, you know,
various things like that,

370
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:59,963
because our bodies

371
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,833
are constantly absorbing
dead energy.

372
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:05,506
Do you ever worry about
being physically attacked?

373
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,008
Well, I don't
particularly like it,

374
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:09,911
but, you know,
it's just part of the job.

375
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,214
- I worry about it, 'cause I'm sending her
in there. - Right.

376
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:15,186
But I don't know about it
until I see it on TV.

377
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,225
I don't like that.

378
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,161
What's going on?

379
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:29,005
Like a little push,
a little nudge, on my back.

380
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,828
Okay.

381
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,451
Eee, I don't like that.

382
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,452
But we got a job to do,

383
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,187
and, you know,
it's like when I was a cop.

384
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,725
You got to go through that door.
What are you gonna do?

385
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,358
- It's your job. Go through it.
- Right.

386
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:45,727
Coming up next...

387
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:48,198
But they were never
living people.

388
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,619
...Amy faces
a childhood enemy.

389
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,971
I am seeing, like,
shadow figures.

390
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:57,345
They want to remove
living people or kill them.

391
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,911
We get a lot of questions about
paranormal manifestations.

392
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:22,744
Nancy wants to know

393
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,416
if the shadow people you saw
in Acampo, California,

394
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,086
were the worst
you've ever seen,

395
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:28,687
and "are they
deceased people

396
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,523
or completely different
entities?"

397
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:36,433
I feel like there's more
kind of going on in this area.

398
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,942
Wait a minute.

399
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:48,783
I am seeing, like,
shadow figures,

400
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,921
which makes me uncomfortable.

401
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:55,025
I do not like those things.

402
00:17:56,727 --> 00:18:01,166
That case was surprising because
there were so many of them.

403
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,570
There's a lot of different
theories out there

404
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:04,570
in regards to them.

405
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,142
But they were never
living people.

406
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:08,742
Basically, though,

407
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:15,387
they seem to want to remove
living people or kill them,

408
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:17,388
typically elderly
or children.

409
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,092
There was a lot going on
in that house.

410
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:22,495
Yes.
I did not like that house.

411
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,066
- Even during the reveal, she was having
issues. - I didn't like it.

412
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,489
I'm actually terrified
of these things...

413
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,877
and I've had
my own experience with them

414
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,443
when I was a child.

415
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,816
It was actually my first memory
of an experience

416
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:38,417
was with shadow people,

417
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,220
and they actually
tried to kill me.

418
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,393
They influenced me
to bite my electrical cord,

419
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:46,261
and I was electrocuted.

420
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:48,633
That's when I also
kind of figured out

421
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,100
that they were not good.

422
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,239
And it was very unnerving,
you know,

423
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:54,892
and frightening for me.

424
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,475
- Frightening for me, too.
- Yeah.

425
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,247
Now, Tiffany writes,

426
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:02,251
"Amy, you encountered
a demonic presence

427
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,105
"that pretended to be
a little boy

428
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,924
at the house
in Belvidere, Illinois."

429
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:09,026
He likes really bad ****

430
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:13,802
He lets things in
that are really bad sometimes.

431
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:20,411
But he seems too **** evil
to be a 5-year-old.

432
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,331
I don't like him. Okay.

433
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,391
It's not a real kid.

434
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,196
It's something really bad.

435
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,065
Like what?

436
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,169
Demons will pretend
to be dead people.

437
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,109
How do you actually know
when entities are demons,

438
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,611
and what exactly are
demons?

439
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:51,036
Demons are things that
have never been in human form,

440
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:56,427
and what they want to accomplish
is to destroy the living

441
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,264
and to destroy
as many as possible.

442
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,535
But sometimes they'll trick you,
at first. They will.

443
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,971
If you stick with that entity
long enough,

444
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:07,843
they'll probably do something
like that one did,

445
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,146
like, seeing the morphing
and all this,

446
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:12,716
and then I was like,
"Man.

447
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:16,589
You know, "It's not a child.
It's a demon."

448
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:18,675
On that subject,
Angel writes,

449
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,726
"In the case
in Garrett, Indiana,

450
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:23,431
there was an entity that was
trying to possess you."

451
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:27,102
This thing
can go in your body.

452
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,740
Now it's, like, grabbing
and trying to get my heart.

453
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,042
It's gonna make me sick.

454
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,081
This thing is, like,
really attacking me.

455
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:40,021
"Can you tell me more about
how possession occurs?"

456
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:43,157
In a true possession case,

457
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:47,966
where an individual has been
taken over by a demonic entity,

458
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:51,101
I believe that person

459
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:55,443
would do as much harm
to as many people as possible.

460
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,478
Possession
is<i> extremely</i> rare.

461
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:02,586
So, I believe there's
different types of attachments

462
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,988
that are not necessarily
possessions,

463
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:10,497
where you may have dead people
who take over living people.

464
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,233
Have you ever had it happen
to you?

465
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:13,633
Yeah, yeah. Yep.

466
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,737
I- I mean,
I've had people jump me.

467
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,905
What does that mean,
jump you?

468
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,406
Enter my body.

469
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:21,779
Were you getting jumped in
Wichita, Kansas, with Herbie?

470
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,314
Is that what he was doing?

471
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,386
He's real grumpy.
Really grumpy guy.

472
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,559
Herbie's getting
a little aggressive.

473
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:35,166
Stop it.

474
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,203
Stop it!

475
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,942
Geez,
what the **** man.

476
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:44,276
This is weird.

477
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:47,247
It's like he knows how to, like,
do the electrical impulses

478
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:49,084
in your body
and your brain.

479
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,352
I don't like it at all.

480
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:54,690
He was very good,
actually,

481
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,195
at being able to manipulate
the human body

482
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,197
and had learned

483
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:02,635
how to go through
the central nervous system.

484
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,572
And at first,
he was kind to you,

485
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,976
but he thought you were there
for a different reason.

486
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:10,313
Yeah. I got a lot of ****
from the dead

487
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:12,615
who figure out
why I'm really there.

488
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,425
And if they don't want to go,
they get very upset at me.

489
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,560
"In Flint, Michigan,
you recommended

490
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:23,349
"the client get a priest
to exorcise the property.

491
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,103
On top of that, the client
had her own exorcism."

492
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,272
This is no longer your land.

493
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,040
You must go to Christ.

494
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:34,981
Go to the place that
Christ has prepared for you.

495
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,650
No!

496
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:41,756
"Do all possessions
require an exorcism?"

497
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:44,795
Like I said, it's extremely rare
for an individual

498
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,199
to be truly possessed
by a demon or devil.

499
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,167
They can have attachments

500
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,675
from dead living people
who might be jerks.

501
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,149
They don't need a priest
to remove attachments.

502
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:01,016
They can have
any holy man do that

503
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:03,554
or they can have a healer,
et cetera, et cetera,

504
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:04,855
to remove the attachments.

505
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,710
Very rare that
it's a true possession.

506
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:10,496
Steve, Danny asks,
"You've used sketches

507
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:13,201
"in your crime investigations
before, of course.

508
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:14,635
"How useful
and accurate are they,

509
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,110
and how did they compare
to the ones that Amy provides?"

510
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:22,848
Her sketches are about
as dead-on as you can get.

511
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:29,390
So, I did a sketch
that I think might be him.

512
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,358
Wow.

513
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,661
Look at this photo.

514
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:37,869
Now look at this sketch.
You tell me.

515
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:47,198
The same cruel mouth.

516
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,753
The same boxer-like nose.

517
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,341
And the ears.

518
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:55,894
Yeah, the long ears.

519
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,395
She has him.

520
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,198
I would say that's him.

521
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,770
If I had a witness like her
in my cases,

522
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,307
it would be a lot easier
to solve them.

523
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,141
Why are you
still surprised

524
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,212
when you see a sketch
that matches so perfectly,

525
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,248
when Amy knows exactly
what happened in the house?

526
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,918
It's 'cause
I've dealt with people

527
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,351
doing sketches for crimes.

528
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,357
What'll happen is, you'll catch
the guy who actually did it,

529
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,744
and then you compare it
to the sketch they did,

530
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:22,097
and you're like, you know,
"It's not even close."

531
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:23,565
And it's hard
to do a description.

532
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,202
It's like you had met a stranger
that walked into a coffee shop

533
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,835
and then you're like,
"All right,

534
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,739
give me a description of
the guy that you just
saw for two minutes."

535
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,241
That's difficult to do.

536
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:31,608
So then
when I see her sketches

537
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,480
and I realize how close
they are, I'm like --

538
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,966
And then she's
so down on herself --

539
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,417
"Well, I don't know.
I don't know."

540
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:37,851
It drives me insane,

541
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,222
because I know people are not
that accurate at all.

542
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:42,592
It's just human nature.
People aren't trained for it.

543
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:43,759
Right. Right.

544
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:46,496
- I don't think we're gonna
convince her. - No.

545
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:47,832
Coming up...

546
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,138
She had a demonic scratch.
I'll never forget it.

547
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,505
...the paranormal shocks

548
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,976
even the most hardened
homicide detective.

549
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:57,412
She just wanted to die.
That's how bad it was.

550
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,183
Broke my heart.

551
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:20,476
We receive
a lot of questions

552
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,682
about what it takes
to make the show --

553
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,853
to solve a case,
follow an investigation.

554
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:28,789
And Kathy asks, "Steve,

555
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:31,392
"I love the history
you find on the locations.

556
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:34,732
How much time does it really
take to do the research?"

557
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,451
It takes a lot of preparation.
A lot.

558
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,101
I have to have
everything lined up,

559
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,156
all my ducks in a row,
before I get there.

560
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,141
So, I got to have historians
lined up,

561
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,913
genealogists lined up,
archivists lined up,

562
00:25:44,948 --> 00:25:46,432
where to get this information --

563
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,310
all lined up
before we get there.

564
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,901
Now I ask things
so differently now

565
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:53,422
than I did
our first investigations,

566
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:56,027
because I know what she needs
when we're at the reveal table.

567
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:58,481
Like, I would never ask
somebody,

568
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,866
"So-and-so lived here in 1920.

569
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,304
Did he have any kids
or daughters?"

570
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,736
I wouldn't care before.

571
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,976
Now I know she may need to know,
"Well, did they have any kids?"

572
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:10,314
So, she puts a lot more
on my plate than I already have.

573
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:13,085
And not only do you need
to know how someone died,

574
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,188
but you also
have to speak to people

575
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:16,387
to understand the symptoms

576
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:18,358
and what it feels like
to die like that,

577
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,829
because that's, a lot of times,
what Amy's feeling.

578
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,932
Right. Because she is
a physical medium,

579
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,168
she takes on
those pains and stuff.

580
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:26,335
So, I get experts in line

581
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,138
that'll be able
to articulate to me,

582
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:31,410
and to the viewers, obviously,
what those symptoms would be,

583
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:34,315
and then at least
I can bring that to the table.

584
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,185
Something similar happened
in Uriah, Alabama,

585
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,421
where Amy was seeing
young children

586
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:40,588
who looked like zombies.

587
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:42,727
They were yellow,
and it turned out to be...

588
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:43,726
Yellow fever.

589
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:47,216
So, the husband, Mr. King,

590
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:50,363
he comes back,
he contracts yellow fever.

591
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,475
And from what we understand,
he came home.

592
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,544
He was very sick.

593
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:58,749
During that time, they lost
two of their young children.

594
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,318
So, there's, like, intestines,

595
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,953
and there's, like, blood,

596
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:07,795
and it had something to do with,
like, the abdominal area.

597
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,234
Like, that's the focus,
is, like, the abdominal area.

598
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:14,035
They look ghoulish.

599
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,871
Like, they're, like, pale,

600
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:18,310
and, like, they have, like,
the dark circles in the --

601
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,809
around their eyes.

602
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:22,012
They look like zombies.

603
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:23,314
That's a perfect example.

604
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,919
Like, stuff I would never
have cared about before

605
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,156
is now almost
on my top priority.

606
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:32,395
What case was the most
challenging to research?

607
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,563
Well,
they're all challenging,

608
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:37,269
but the one that had the most
conflict in it for me,

609
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:39,156
where I couldn't tell
what was what,

610
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,973
was in Huntington,
West Virginia.

611
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,327
It says
she died from a fall.

612
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,612
But the articles are vague,
and they just...

613
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:49,520
The articles are not just vague.
They're contradictory.

614
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,552
Right.

615
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:54,259
I have here
her death certificate,

616
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,094
which actually says

617
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:00,967
that she died
from acute alcohol poisoning.

618
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:04,673
But the paper says she fell,
so...

619
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,041
who do you think's right?

620
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,909
I have no idea.

621
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,882
I didn't have a straight answer
of how it happened.

622
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,284
So, that was
frustrating for me,

623
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,291
because records from those
time periods just were unclear,

624
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:19,160
until we sat down
at the reveal.

625
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:20,694
Then everything became clear.

626
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:26,738
Steve, Brian wants to know
if you're ever concerned

627
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:29,174
about something
following you home --

628
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,244
something paranormal.

629
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,245
Um...no, not really.

630
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,183
Never tho-- never --
I don't even think about it.

631
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:36,216
You don't?

632
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:37,770
No. When I go
into an investigation,

633
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:39,289
I'm not thinking about
my own concerns.

634
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,355
I'm thinking about the client.

635
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,543
Do you think
Steve should be concerned?

636
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,696
I think if something
did follow him,

637
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,296
he would be oblivious
to it.

638
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,700
- So, I don't think it would matter much.

639
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,004
I don't think anybody's
gonna go out of their way...

640
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,372
...to follow Steve home.

641
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:53,908
What does that mean?

642
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,711
Why would they not
follow Steve home?

643
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,514
Do they not like
his apartment, or...

644
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,382
No, no!

645
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,987
Um, because, you know,
he wouldn't care.

646
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:04,640
He would --

647
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,258
- I got my own problems.
- Right.

648
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:08,529
Well, that brings up
an interesting point.

649
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,763
When you say
Steve doesn't care,

650
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,650
is the best way
to get rid of one to not care?

651
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:13,503
So, they're gonna
want to go with somebody

652
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:15,457
who is going to
deal with them.

653
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,341
Steve would not
deal with them.

654
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,711
"Deal with them," meaning
"interact with them"?

655
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:21,112
Correct. Yes.

656
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:22,749
And Steve would not
interact with them.
He would ignore them.

657
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:23,749
Correct.

658
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,752
More than likely.

659
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:27,721
Should it be a concern
among the crew,

660
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:30,259
being followed home
by some of the entities

661
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:32,763
from some of the places
that we investigate?

662
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,564
I think so, yes.

663
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,402
It just depends on if you're
sensitive to it or not,

664
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:39,956
and you may
or may not know that.

665
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,441
Now, there was
one case in particular

666
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:46,548
when a member of the crew
got followed by something

667
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,151
in Acampo, California.

668
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,684
I woke up this morning,

669
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,956
discovered I had
these scratches here.

670
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,524
It freaked me out,

671
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,229
so I called Amy,
and she met me here.

672
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,899
You do have
some indications here

673
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,968
for a poltergeist attack.

674
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:05,207
Like, specifically
around the cuts,

675
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:09,147
of a poltergeist-type
manifestation.

676
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,380
Very powerful.

677
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:12,248
- Okay.
- So, you okay?

678
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:14,721
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- You're gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

679
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:17,358
I'm just scared.

680
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:18,926
I'm sorry.

681
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:20,460
It's okay.

682
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,864
What is a poltergeist
exactly?

683
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,900
A poltergeist is

684
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:28,808
energy that is emitted by
living people who have PK --

685
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:31,477
psychokinesis,
or telekinesis.

686
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:35,483
So, a kid gets upset
and a door slams shut.

687
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:39,322
And it can affect
their surroundings,

688
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,759
whether they are
aware of it or not,

689
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:43,126
in a physical manner.

690
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:44,563
Yeah, but was she picked on
for a reason,

691
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:45,829
or attacked
for a reason?

692
00:30:45,864 --> 00:30:49,837
Um, I think that there were
some kind of religious issues

693
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:51,905
and lots
of religious undertones.

694
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,344
She had a demonic scratch.
I'll never forget it.

695
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:58,749
I think we looked for
every possible explanation

696
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:00,183
for that scratch.

697
00:31:00,218 --> 00:31:03,005
There was no way
that we could figure out

698
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,792
how she could have gotten
those scratches

699
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:08,494
other than
something paranormal.

700
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:11,031
- It's not like she was looking for
attention. - No.

701
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,300
Next...

702
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,939
I'm sorry.
I'm very upset right now.

703
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,543
Helping the living and the dead

704
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:20,812
takes its toll
on Steve and Amy.

705
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,447
That was probably

706
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:26,154
one of the most overwhelming
experiences I've ever had.

707
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:47,434
Now, I know
these investigations

708
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:49,954
are physically tough
on both of you.

709
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:51,822
There are
a lot of demands.

710
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,223
But Renee wants to know

711
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,695
what it's like emotionally
for you both

712
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,229
when you investigate homes

713
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,901
where the people living there
are scared for their lives.

714
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,770
It's a huge responsibility

715
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:06,443
to take care of them
and to tell them what to do

716
00:32:06,478 --> 00:32:10,081
and to make sure
that they're going to be okay.

717
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:11,649
And I know
it's especially hard for you

718
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:13,453
when kids are involved,
'cause you're a dad.

719
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:14,620
Yeah. I mean, you --

720
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:17,590
Nobody wants to see
kids suffering.

721
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,413
But when I see children
going through stuff

722
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:23,201
I couldn't imagine
going through as an adult,

723
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:24,869
and them not knowing
or understanding

724
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:26,004
what the hell's happening,

725
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,138
it tears at my heart,

726
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:28,841
not only for the kids
but for the parents

727
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,475
that don't know
what to do for their kids.

728
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,148
Imagine being a parent --
the father or mother --

729
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:35,735
and you cannot fight
what you can't see.

730
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,253
And I always think about,
for every family

731
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:41,192
that lets us in their front door
to investigate,

732
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,994
there are 500
that tell their kids,

733
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,094
"Shut up and go to bed.

734
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,765
There's no such thing
as ghosts."

735
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,367
We had that case
in Alabama

736
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:52,441
where the husband didn't believe
the wife was seeing things,

737
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:54,042
and he was raised
Southern Baptist.

738
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:55,377
They don't believe
in anything after life.

739
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:56,846
They believe you go to Heaven
or you go to Hell.

740
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:59,634
So he just couldn't comprehend
that she was seeing something.

741
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:02,388
Even though he was experiencing
these things as clear as day.

742
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:03,589
Which was contradictory.

743
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:08,130
I got out of my truck,
went up on the stairs,

744
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:11,467
and it was like I startled
a young girl.

745
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:13,334
She screamed.

746
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:18,878
Then I went inside and up
and come back down the steps,

747
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,746
and she screamed
two more times.

748
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,216
It was like I startled her.

749
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,785
And we see that a lot
with husbands.

750
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,224
I mean, sweet couple.
They were really nice people,

751
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,862
but you could see
the frustration on her face.

752
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:34,233
Amy, there was one case
in particular,

753
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,900
in Blackshear, Georgia,

754
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:38,438
that I think
really hit you hard.

755
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:40,106
It was Pearl,

756
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,878
the young girl who had been
burned to death there.

757
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:46,182
Pearl burned to death
in the house here.

758
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:48,386
My God.

759
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,555
She burned beyond recognition.

760
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,159
I got a picture of her.

761
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,029
This is Pearl.

762
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:59,569
She lingered
for like seven hours.

763
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,938
My God.

764
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,576
It had to be agony.

765
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,713
You all right?

766
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,587
I'm sorry.
I'm very upset right now.

767
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:17,692
My God.

768
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:20,563
I told you there were ghosts
in this house.

769
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:22,499
Why was that
so difficult for you?

770
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:25,437
You know, I had been
hanging out with her

771
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:28,306
for, like, about
a week and a half or so.

772
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,478
You know, she was
under the table at the reveal,

773
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:33,832
and she was going through
everything

774
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,117
and was becoming
extremely emotional,

775
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,588
just because, like, you know,
she was finally being heard,

776
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,457
and, you know,
things were being understood.

777
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:43,794
And then her death came up
and she was reliving that,

778
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:49,170
and so I was also, you know,
feeling her emotions and my own,

779
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:52,606
and it became overwhelming.

780
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:55,712
Steve, I have a question from
Kathleen, who wants to know,

781
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:59,651
"Is there one case in particular
that hit you the hardest?"

782
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,890
For me, probably Browns Summit,
North Carolina.

783
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,743
Carrie is special-needs.

784
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,526
She's had 19 surgeries,

785
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,797
and 14 of those
have been brain surgeries.

786
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:09,997
Geez.

787
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:11,233
But since a few months ago,

788
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:14,205
it's just taken
a very negative turn.

789
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,773
Okay, in what way?

790
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:18,945
It's becoming very physical.

791
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,048
Carrie
has been seeing things.

792
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,020
She kept saying
she was gonna be whipped

793
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,788
and she was
gonna be burned.

794
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:31,329
She has visions
of being nailed to a cross.

795
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:33,230
That was one of those instances

796
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,502
where somebody was mentally
handicapped and disabled

797
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:38,203
and was being tortured,

798
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:42,444
and the parents just couldn't --
didn't know how to help her.

799
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,279
She just wanted to die.
That's how bad it was.

800
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:46,917
I heard her weeping when
I was interviewing the mother,

801
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:49,887
and to hear that sobbing
broke my heart.

802
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:53,759
This is a mother
that hears this all day long.

803
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:56,364
So, I heard it for two minutes,
and I was ready to break down.

804
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,334
Couldn't imagine
living with that.

805
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,269
That one
really tugged at my heart.

806
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:01,603
Amy, how about you?

807
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:04,642
What location were you most
concerned for the client?

808
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:07,111
Cedar Park, Texas.

809
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,213
The next thing that I saw

810
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:12,202
was all of these people
in the trees.

811
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,122
I did get
the distinct impression

812
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:17,394
that they would like to
burn your house down.

813
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:22,434
The reason being,
they're disgusted by you.

814
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:29,410
The big question is,
is it safe for you to be here?

815
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:31,444
I would probably move.

816
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:36,252
They may accomplish
their mission...

817
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:46,131
She was deteriorating rapidly,
her health,

818
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:50,106
and there wasn't really anything
that could be done,

819
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:55,280
at that location,
to fix the problem.

820
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:56,546
It's tough.

821
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,819
Yeah. I think that left
an impression on all of us.

822
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:01,156
- Coming up next...

823
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,531
...find out which cases
Steve and Amy feared the most.

824
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:13,571
It was just the worst
nightmare of a movie
that you can think of.

825
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,940
Whole place is haunted.

826
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,435
Amy, Yvette wants to know,

827
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,140
"What has been the most intense
paranormal experience

828
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,843
"you've had
on 'The Dead Files'

829
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:42,176
that's impacted your life?"

830
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:48,587
I really did not enjoy
the Santa Fe investigation,

831
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:54,395
because it was extremely
physically damaging

832
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,133
as far as my body
was concerned,

833
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:01,837
and it was also
really scary.

834
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,959
I really feel sick.

835
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:08,045
Like I'm gonna vomit.

836
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,616
Is it you
or the location?

837
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:12,737
It's the location.

838
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:14,857
It's, like, haunted.

839
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,563
Whole place is haunted.

840
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:23,468
I feel like my neck
is breaking, and...

841
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,009
Everything, it hurts.

842
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:32,865
My head.

843
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:37,454
It's, like, all right here.

844
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:46,466
Are you okay?

845
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:49,270
What's wrong?

846
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,407
Amy?

847
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,844
That was probably

848
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:59,252
one of the most overwhelming
experiences I've ever had.

849
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,587
I was pretty much
rendered speechless.

850
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:02,989
You said it was scary.

851
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:06,094
What scares someone who sees
dead people on a daily basis?

852
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:09,999
You know, that one entity
was so powerful.

853
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:15,908
He had caused so much horror
to so many people,

854
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:18,443
even though
they were criminals.

855
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:21,947
I think it was just
comprehending that evil.

856
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:24,619
The first place we ever
investigated that involved
law enforcement

857
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,691
where teaching about hauntings
and ghosts

858
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:30,694
were in their curriculum
for the academy.

859
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,799
Did you ever hear stories
about paranormal stuff

860
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,565
going on here
before you started working?

861
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,139
They talked to us about
some of the paranormal
activity at the academy.

862
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:39,258
They just touched on it.

863
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,635
But they did mention it.

864
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,091
They did mention it, yes.

865
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:43,513
I was floored by that.

866
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,813
Yeah.

867
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,816
So, that alone
made you understand

868
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,854
that it had to be pretty bad
for them to actually put that

869
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,256
in the curriculum
for their training.

870
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,656
They told
the prison guards,

871
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:53,861
"Expect to see things
that you can't explain."

872
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,230
And it was just part
of the curriculum.

873
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:56,496
Yeah.

874
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:58,165
- And they weren't bashful about talking
about it. - No. They were not.

875
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,968
They were
pretty forthcoming.

876
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,470
What'd you experience
in here?

877
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:03,541
Just, like, a shadow
that you would see,

878
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:05,277
like, on a bright day,
someone walking by.

879
00:40:05,312 --> 00:40:06,979
But there was nobody there
to make a shadow?

880
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,348
No.

881
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:09,647
No, no.

882
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:11,384
You also, Steve,

883
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:16,626
you had one of your more intense
interviews with Craig.

884
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,496
That's the name I gave him
was Craig.

885
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:20,897
That's not his real name.

886
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:24,770
Everybody and their mother,
from authors to news reporters,

887
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,958
wanted to get ahold of this guy
and speak to him.

888
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:29,111
He had done time for murder
in the prison there,

889
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:30,980
and he was there
when the riot happened.

890
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:32,814
He was actually part
of how it happened.

891
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:57,716
I know you've seen
a lot of horrible things,

892
00:40:57,717 --> 00:41:01,121
but have you ever seen so many
horrible things in one place

893
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,893
happen in such a short amount
of time?

894
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,595
Not really.
I mean, not like that.

895
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,199
I've seen multiple, multiple
homicides at once scene,

896
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,999
but what he described,

897
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:15,041
the blood flowing through
the hallways like a river,

898
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,708
I'm picturing it in my head,

899
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:19,145
how this chaotic scene
must have been.

900
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,417
It was just the worst
nightmare of a movie
that you can think of.

901
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,021
Never mind the paranormal.

902
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:26,589
Just showing how evil

903
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:29,294
and how brutal
living people can be.

904
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,128
But my part of it was

905
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:32,431
I wanted to do
a good investigation,

906
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:33,984
find out
what the story was,

907
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,502
and coincide with her case.

908
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,970
Yeah. Yep.

909
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,308
So, here's a question
that we all want the answer to,

910
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:40,975
but Gloria was wise enough
to ask it.

911
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,280
"Can you get me the upcoming
Powerball winning numbers?

912
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,450
I tried that
the first time I met her.

913
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:47,851
It didn't work.

914
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,721
Especially --
I mean, I'm --

915
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:52,358
You know, my dominant ability
is mediumship,

916
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,197
and, you know, you don't use
your abilities that way.

917
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:55,915
Yeah, you do!

918
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,563
Usually if you --

919
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,433
If I had them,
I'd use them.

920
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,069
Usually, if you do that,
you lose them.

921
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,040
I'd only need it the one time
if it's a big Powerball, though.

922
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:05,545
So you're saying nothing good
comes from personal gain?

923
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,147
Right.

924
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:08,714
See?

925
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:10,601
It's back
to working hard again.

926
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:12,453
So, guys,
I just want to say thanks.

927
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,887
Thanks for all the hard work
you're doing,

928
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,459
and thank you for taking
the time between investigations

929
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,229
to answer
all these questions for us.

930
00:42:18,264 --> 00:42:18,763
Thank you.

931
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:19,228
It means lot.

932
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,397
Thanks
for having us here.

933
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,066
This is something
we always wanted to do

934
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,037
was answer
some fan questions.

935
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:25,538
We love our fans.

936
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,007
- They're the most devoted fans
on the planet. - Cool.

937
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:29,978
Thanks for watching.
Keep sending us your questions

938
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,379
and keep watching
"The Dead Files."

939
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:33,183
