1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,826
Some guy is yelling, ha,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:16,788
They told me if I knew what they
knew I would never buy the place.

4
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:18,489
Very, very sad.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,927
When it happens it's
terrifying, actually.

6
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:24,515
There was somebody who
killed themselves here.

7
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:27,169
Shoots him in the back of
the head, kills him instantly.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,256
I love this building. I'll
never walk away from it.

9
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:34,037
It's like a city of the dead.

10
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:35,922
It's really bad in here.

11
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:38,911
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,867
Something is not right.

13
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:42,176
I see dead people.

14
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:44,192
This person might have
been a serial killer.

15
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,954
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,490
You get those chills.

17
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,058
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,561
He is darkness. He is evil.

19
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,664
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,470
I think she broke her neck.

21
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:57,657
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:02,050
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

23
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:03,475
You telling me the truth?

24
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,582
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

25
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,217
I think the Devil is down here.

26
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,718
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,458
Who the hell would do this?

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,323
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,294
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:16,889
Until the very end.

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,031
Who's he looking to kill?

32
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,138
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,305
You need to get out of here right now.

34
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,473
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:27,074
It was like endless darkness.

36
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,158
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,059
I look into the history of the location,
digging up its secrets and forgotten past.

38
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:56,918
While Amy speaks with the dead.

39
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:00,479
I'm in the old Wild West,
Deadwood, South Dakota.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,770
We got called in by a guy named Ron.

41
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,582
Now, Ron runs a bar and casino in town.

42
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,577
And for the past 20 years, he's
been trying to restore the building.

43
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,945
Only problem is, every
time he swings a hammer

44
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,914
the paranormal activity gets dangerous.

45
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:16,829
He says time is running
out and that Amy and I

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,930
are his last chance to
have his dream come true.

47
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:32,759
Before Amy arrives, I look for anything
that might influence her findings.

48
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:36,730
This hotel casino has a lot
of photographs and historic

49
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:41,535
information that has to
be covered or removed.

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,436
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:07,182
There's more dead here than
the dead here would like.

52
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:11,185
It's hard to keep all of them in line.

53
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:14,666
There's five men here now.

54
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,978
They're, like, a team
of bad men that are now

55
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,191
trying to make up for their bad deeds.

56
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:26,229
And I think their crimes
run from stealing to murder.

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,030
You know, basically,
they're gonna escort me.

58
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:34,611
The one guy says, like,
it's like a city of the dead.

59
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:45,035
This place is amazing.

60
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,814
It's a great place.

61
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:50,116
When I walked in the door, I
fell in love with the place.

62
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:54,187
I just knew that I needed to be
here, kind of like I was here before.

63
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:58,346
And so, I want the place restored
just like it was in the past.

64
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,251
Now, did you have any
ideas that there may be

65
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,225
some stuff going on when
you went to go buy it?

66
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,593
Yes, I did.

67
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,920
When I talked to the previous owners...

68
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,141
They told me if I knew
what they knew or saw

69
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,082
what they had seen, I
would never buy the place.

70
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,337
Now, let me ask you a question, before
you bought this place were you a skeptic?

71
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,355
- Do you believe in paranormal?
- Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

72
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,047
But, after I've been here,
what I've seen, I believe now.

73
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,083
Can you give me, like, a broad idea
of all the stuff that's happening here?

74
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,171
Well, we've had things thrown around.

75
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:30,804
People hear noises, doors
are opening and closing.

76
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,870
You know, people are
feeling that they're being

77
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,450
touched and they get really frightened.

78
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,623
That's a problem.

79
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,850
Oh, yeah. I've had
customers run out the door.

80
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,166
Do you know any history
about the building itself?

81
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:45,502
It was a Brothel in the past and
there was illegal gambling here.

82
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,504
Let me ask you a question,
how long are you here?

83
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:50,374
- 23 years.
- So, why are you calling us now?

84
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,176
The more work we do, the
more the activity picks up.

85
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:55,430
Some of the investors get spooked off.

86
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:58,273
And I love this place,
and it hurts me not to

87
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:03,074
see the place of my
dreams come to fruition.

88
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:18,905
The dead don't care for the decor.

89
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:27,908
So, each dead person tries to keep it
the way it was when they were alive.

90
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,398
- Mm.
- Because...

91
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,139
It confuses them, and
that makes them upset.

92
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:38,778
It does hurt my head.

93
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,458
So, Ron, why'd you bring me up here?

94
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,467
I brought you up here because this
is one of the creepiest places.

95
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,342
What's the story?

96
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:53,136
Activity picks up as soon as we
start doing construction here.

97
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,761
So it's as if whatever's here
doesn't want you to make changes?

98
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:57,453
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:00,878
So now, have you ever experienced
anything yourself up here?

100
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,514
Yeah. There's this gray-haired woman,

101
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:06,926
and I don't know why, but she's
always laying on the floor.

102
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,960
Can you see through her?

103
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,968
No, like a solid apparition.

104
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:14,938
Does she acknowledge or
look at you when you see her?

105
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,471
Yeah, she looks at me.

106
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:20,403
And then, when I see her, I just turn
around and head right the heck out.

107
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:22,587
And you're sure this is
not some kind of maybe a

108
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:24,729
reflection coming from
outside or anything like that?

109
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,677
I've seen it too many times and
it's always in the same place.

110
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,497
How do you deal with this?

111
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:31,566
- Well, you got to deal with it.
- Right.

112
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,298
And so, every time I enter
a space that I haven't

113
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,028
been in for a while,
I'll say, coming in!

114
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,430
I feel more comfortable.

115
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,649
Okay, is there anything else?

116
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,860
I've seen a guy that's
clothed in dark clothing,

117
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,083
like a long rider coat, late at night.

118
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,430
- Okay.
- Dark hat.

119
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:48,741
And moves from the ladies' room area,

120
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,580
and then kind of vanishes
towards the back of the room.

121
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,914
Has anybody else seen it?

122
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:58,815
Yeah, most of my employees have
seen him, some customers, as well.

123
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,107
The dead Cowboy dudes, one's saying

124
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:09,747
a lot of good times over
here, drinking and gambling.

125
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:14,548
One of them says that
something bad happened.

126
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,761
They're not really letting me get it.

127
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,108
They're blocking it.

128
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:23,549
And I feel, like, an impact in my head.

129
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,611
I feel like it's male.

130
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:33,512
Either they got shot in the head
or they shot themselves in the head.

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,769
I lived here for five years.

132
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,242
- Was this your bedroom?
- Yeah, I moved out in '95.

133
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,595
Okay, so what happened?

134
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:51,496
Well, I was laying down over here,
sleeping, and I was laying like this.

135
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,872
And all of a sudden, I just went
up like this and, what the...

136
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:58,451
And I seen... right where you're
standing is where I saw this tall woman.

137
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,610
She was in a green dress with red hair.

138
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:04,918
And I couldn't move, and she just
stood there about four or five minutes.

139
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,479
And I just couldn't move.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,986
Are you on any kind of medication
when you go to bed at night?

141
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,020
No.

142
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,696
That must have scared
the hell out of you.

143
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:13,917
Yeah, I moved out that next month.

144
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,744
Now, would you stay
overnight alone again?

145
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,362
No. No.

146
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,997
So now, is there anything else you
can tell me that might help my case?

147
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,137
Many people have had to stay here.

148
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:27,112
They've had the sensation of their
hand being moved off their chest.

149
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:29,577
Or away from their side
while they are sleeping.

150
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:32,909
And it had been a very
frightening experience to them.

151
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,521
If we don't get this paranormal problem
fixed, I might never get any investors.

152
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,414
I might never get the place fixed.

153
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:41,073
If my partner told you things
are gonna get worse here, or

154
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,758
you really shouldn't stay
here, how would you take that?

155
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,261
Well, I love this building.

156
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:48,982
I'll never walk away from it.

157
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,359
There's a male...

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,860
Who is not a happy camper.

159
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,341
Who is not a happy camper.

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,620
At all.

161
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:07,602
Mm-mm. This grumpy guy,
he stays up here a lot.

162
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:13,449
I feel like up here is, like,
off-limits for living people.

163
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,390
And he gets pissed.

164
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:23,627
Makes him feel angry.

165
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,992
Do you know if he does
anything to the living?

166
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:30,301
I know he is working on
trying to physically harm them.

167
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,622
He's trying to...

168
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,623
Scare them to death.

169
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,072
Kathleen, I talked to Ron, and he
was telling me that you work here.

170
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:02,518
But he also said that you
actually lived here at some point.

171
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,228
Yes, I was here for a week.

172
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,978
And I am the only person on staff
who will come up into the 2nd floor.

173
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,828
So, none of the other
staff will come up here?

174
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,604
No, they send me.

175
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:15,596
- Have you had experiences here?
- I've had my hair stroked.

176
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:20,445
I've had a hand on my forehead, and
I've had a hand on my lower back.

177
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,523
Can you tell if it was a
man's hand or a woman's?

178
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:26,617
It seemed to be as if a man was
escorting a lady out for the evening.

179
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,444
When it happens it's
terrifying, actually.

180
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,479
The hair stands up on
the back of your neck.

181
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,614
You feel an electrical
crackling and you shake.

182
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,686
Okay, so is there anything
else you've experienced up here?

183
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:40,348
I woke up around 3:20 in the morning.

184
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,557
I heard footsteps outside.

185
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,275
I heard voices.

186
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:49,677
I opened my eyes, and there was a woman
at the foot of my bed wearing a blue dress.

187
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,900
I think her hair was red.

188
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,570
- And she was just looking at me.
- Somebody broke in maybe?

189
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,358
The alarm would have gone off and
the police would have been here.

190
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:01,202
I was scared enough to not only bolt
the door, but to pull the heaviest

191
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:06,615
piece of furniture from the room
and put it in front of the door.

192
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:11,416
There's a woman, and
she was always talking.

193
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,958
You can still hear her, you
know, going on and on and on.

194
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,195
People, if they don't see her,
that would [Bleep] shock me.

195
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,764
She worked here.

196
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,568
She was a busybody, who...

197
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:26,269
Was here a lot.

198
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:32,609
- She just always complains.
- What did she do here?

199
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,540
I think she did sleep with people.

200
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,447
The other dead people
don't appreciate her.

201
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,218
So, they'll, like, try
to keep her in a room.

202
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:46,956
So you might hear her yelling or
screaming to get out, or banging on doors.

203
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:51,097
And doors closing on their own, yes.

204
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,046
So, do you have experiences
down here, as well?

205
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,601
- Yes.
- Okay, like what?

206
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,069
Our gaming tokens, for instance.

207
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,473
They're kept far back from the edge of
the counter, so that they don't fall over.

208
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:07,099
And every now and again, you'll
just see one come up from the tray,

209
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,955
flip over and land on the floor.

210
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:13,801
- And you actually see it in the air?
- Yes.

211
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,718
I'm trying to figure out how that
can be explained, and I can't.

212
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,566
Is that the only thing
you've seen down here?

213
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:22,071
There's an old lady who
wears a long, white nightgown,

214
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,430
she walks up and down the hallway.

215
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:28,339
And then stops and just
sort of watches you.

216
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,226
Then she kind of dissolves.

217
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,170
Kathleen, how would Ron take
it if my partner told him...

218
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,428
Listen you got to get out
here, it's basically unsavable,

219
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,563
you have to sell it
and count your losses?

220
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:40,798
He's not going to give up. We
fight back for what we want.

221
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,079
All right.

222
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:50,082
There's an older woman
who putz around a lot here.

223
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:55,646
I'm hearing 65, but she
looks a bit older than that.

224
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,620
She is really tiny.

225
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,697
She is probably only, like, five foot.

226
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:01,698
On the heavier side.

227
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,822
She wears a full dress.

228
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:08,723
She definitely worked a lot here.

229
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:12,584
And she didn't care for...

230
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:17,005
The people that she worked
with or that worked for her.

231
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:21,866
She really didn't care
what happened to them.

232
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,930
- Richard I understand that you work here.
- Yes.

233
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,885
Okay. Now, how long have
you been working here?

234
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:32,432
Off and on for 20 years
or a little better.

235
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,034
What do you do exactly?

236
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:38,738
Well, I do a lot of maintenance work around
the place and I've also worked in the bar.

237
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,807
A little bit of
everything in this place.

238
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:43,656
It seems like everybody is having
experiences here. How about yourself?

239
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,444
Yes, I've definitely had
some experiences here.

240
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,615
Okay, tell me about some of them.

241
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:52,322
Well, one of them when I was working
floor and the cage in the bar.

242
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:55,534
- And I heard a door start creaking.
- Okay.

243
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,671
And I turn around and look at the
door, and the door is opening up,

244
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:04,092
and it opened wide like someone walked into
the place, and then gently went shut again.

245
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,833
Nobody was visible anywhere.

246
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,520
Have you seen anything else?

247
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:12,884
Yeah, at sometime later I was
back here stocking beer cases.

248
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,921
I had locked up, it's 3:00 in the
morning, there's no one in here but me.

249
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:22,215
And somebody walks by and then
disappears right out through the wall.

250
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:24,351
So, what exactly did it look like?

251
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:27,049
A black coat with tails on it.

252
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,037
Now, did you believe in this stuff?

253
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:34,938
I never did till then, but it sure
convinced me at that time, it was all done.

254
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:42,135
There's so many dead people here that
it is making my walk very disorienting.

255
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:44,819
Everyone's trying to talk to me at once.

256
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,980
But one guy by the bar
is demanding my attention.

257
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,746
There's a man. He likes to work here.

258
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:56,462
He feels very attached to the place.

259
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,152
So, he gets mad because
they're not doing it right.

260
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:02,033
And he wants to...

261
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,910
Help, but they're not listening.

262
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:08,393
So what will he do if
they're not listening?

263
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:11,334
Go and hurt people.

264
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:27,290
Ron told me his property
was built as a Brothel.

265
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,306
From what I know about Deadwood, it was a
mining town, so I'm not surprised by that.

266
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,914
But, when I reached out to a local
author, he told me there were two deaths at

267
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:40,815
the property I'm investigating, directly
related to the prostitution business.

268
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:48,802
So, you mentioned on the phone there
were two deaths that would help my case.

269
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:52,572
But, before we get to that, I have got to
ask you a question about prostitution here.

270
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,050
Was it pretty prevalent?

271
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:58,009
During the initial influx of
the population in Deadwood...

272
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,449
There were thousands of men.

273
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,793
And they were here for one
thing, that's to pan gold.

274
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,908
- Right.
- You're looking at something like this.

275
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,829
So this is what it looked like
back in, I guess, the late 1800s?

276
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,690
Yes.

277
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,540
The ratio of men to
women was about 50 to 1.

278
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,687
And everybody was looking for a good time
when they came in from the mining fields.

279
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,676
So they'd dance with the girls
and maybe they'd get lucky.

280
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:26,589
Okay, so how were these girls treated?

281
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,526
Well, there some of them down there that
would beat the crap out of the girls.

282
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,694
Is that right?

283
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:35,419
One person in particular
that I researched

284
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,373
beat the living daylights
out of one of his girls.

285
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,957
He went to court and was fined $5.

286
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,205
Really?

287
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,498
As a matter of a fact, the
closer you got to the badlands,

288
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,575
the worse conditions got for the girls.

289
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,953
Okay, so the guys could act
however the hell they wanted?

290
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:55,234
Pretty much, as long as
they didn't kill the girl.

291
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:03,762
That's kind of strange.

292
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,140
What?

293
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:09,281
They might have had some sex slaves.

294
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:15,495
I think that they died down
here, a lot of the ladies.

295
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,956
It was cold.

296
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,141
Um...

297
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:24,289
They would not eat
and they're all naked.

298
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,526
And they put them in here.

299
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,717
Do you know who is putting them here?

300
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,578
Men?

301
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,537
Now, Joey, you mentioned
on the phone there were

302
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:38,362
two deaths associated
with the Fairmont itself.

303
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:41,129
- Related to prostitution?
- Yes.

304
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,685
It was in 1907, and, Vinegar Rowan,
a sheep herder from Montana...

305
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:50,675
Had a girlfriend that he
was very much attached to

306
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,914
who worked as a
prostitute in the Fairmont.

307
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:53,969
Okay.

308
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,862
And he came in one day to see her.

309
00:17:56,863 --> 00:18:02,554
And when he entered the room, he found
out that she was with another man.

310
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:06,615
So, he pulls out his gun and
immediately shoots that poor bastard.

311
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,971
Does he kill him?

312
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:10,558
- Actually, he'll survive.
- Okay.

313
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,503
And then he took a couple of shots at
his girlfriend, and he missed entirely.

314
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:18,578
So, she leaps out of
bed and grabs him by the

315
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:21,870
shirt and tries to
force him out the door.

316
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:26,942
He reaches around with his
gun and is trying to shoot her.

317
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,161
Boom, boom, boom.

318
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:31,478
And shoots himself in the [Bleep] head.

319
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,683
He's dead.

320
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,649
I've seen a lot of
things in my career but,

321
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,987
this is one of the funniest
stories I've ever heard.

322
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:41,213
- So, what was the other death, Jerry?
- Maggie Broadwater.

323
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:45,108
She had been visiting
a boyfriend in Wyoming...

324
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,723
And they had had a bad parting.

325
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:50,933
And she came back and
started drinking quite a bit.

326
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,619
It wasn't long before she
decided she was going to

327
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,816
jump out of the third floor
window and kill herself.

328
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,092
Here's newspaper clipping.

329
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:01,164
So, this happened in the
Fairmont, she jumped out...

330
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:04,374
She jumped out of the Fairmont.

331
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,923
It says here, jumps
three stories and lives.

332
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,925
The ground was so muddy in
the road where she jumped...

333
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:12,098
She actually stuck in the mud.

334
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,830
And they extracted her from the
mud and took her to the hospital...

335
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,691
Okay.

336
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:18,892
Where she lingered on for about
36 hours, maybe a little longer.

337
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,997
They thought she was gonna survive.

338
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:24,524
But it turned out that she
was dying of internal injuries.

339
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,610
Really? All over some guy?

340
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:29,191
- Yes.
- Okay.

341
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:46,369
I definitely feel like there was
somebody who killed themselves here.

342
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,102
A female.

343
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:54,834
And she did it...

344
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,881
Very dramatically.

345
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:59,762
She was hysterical.

346
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,279
Something bad happened.

347
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:06,122
She was so sad.

348
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:11,051
Like she maybe lost someone.

349
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,666
It was really bad.

350
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,307
Very, very sad.

351
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,152
Look, this is Deadwood, South Dakota.

352
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:34,717
And back in the day,
it was a violent town.

353
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:37,135
Now, I know there had
to be more murders on my

354
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,697
property that had nothing
to do with prostitution.

355
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,632
So, I reached out to
a local Police Chief.

356
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,853
He looked into it for me,
and he said there's a couple

357
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:48,894
more homicides that will
definitely help my case.

358
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:59,754
Chief, I know Deadwood, in my mind,
is the epitome of the wild, Wild West.

359
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:00,900
How bad was it?

360
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:06,545
You know, this is an area that was full
of brothels, full of card rooms, saloons.

361
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,922
So, you might have
shooting in the streets.

362
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:12,156
You might have violence
occurring in the saloons.

363
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,785
So, it was a cop's nightmare.

364
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,728
- Oh, absolutely.
- Okay.

365
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:19,312
On the phone you said there were a couple
murders on the property I am investigating.

366
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,533
Yeah, actually there
was two tragic deaths.

367
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:25,185
Back then, the property you're
investigating was known as the Melodeon.

368
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:28,685
Back in November 16th, 1876...

369
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:32,813
They had a man by the name of Banjo
Dick Brown who was up on stage playing.

370
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:33,678
Okay.

371
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,402
A man in the audience stood
up and started to shout.

372
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:41,692
And in the midst of the shouting
he throws an ax on stage.

373
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,611
And Banjo Dick, without missing a beat,

374
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:47,791
pulls his gun in a crowded
room and shot him dead.

375
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,417
You're kidding me.

376
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,483
So what was the second
death you were talking about?

377
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:54,544
In July 23rd, 1949...

378
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,394
Deadwood's Police
Chief, Nestor Erickson...

379
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:04,227
Shot one of his ex-officers on Main
Street in front of the property.

380
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:06,435
The ex-officer's name was John Gorham.

381
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:10,231
He had worked at the Deadwood
Police Department for a few years

382
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:14,613
before being fired for drinking
while in uniform, and also...

383
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:18,568
He wrongfully beat
somebody while on the job.

384
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,069
John Gorham was a very tough individual.

385
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,231
He's actually a
middleweight boxing champion.

386
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,320
Okay, so how does the shooting go down?

387
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:31,267
He had been going on a drunken rampage.

388
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:36,196
Chief shows up on Main Street and
advised Gorham that he was under arrest.

389
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:40,262
Gorham approached Chief
Erickson with his fists clenched.

390
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:42,341
- It was like he was gonna assault him.
- Okay.

391
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:47,467
Chief Erickson then pulled his
duty weapon, and failing to stop,

392
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,716
the Chief shot him once through
the heart in front of the property.

393
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:54,551
It is said though, that after
being shot that he did advance

394
00:22:54,552 --> 00:23:00,452
four to five more steps towards Chief
Erickson while flailing his arms.

395
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:08,814
Some guy is yelling, ha,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

396
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:11,668
I feel like I'm staggering.

397
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,207
Like I'm trying to get someone.

398
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:19,168
I'm feeling pain... pressure here.

399
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:24,293
I'm staggering.

400
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:27,262
I'm angry, very angry.

401
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:29,043
I don't know if it's
a heart attack or what,

402
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:33,424
but it [Bleep] hurts really [Bleep] bad.

403
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:38,352
With so many deaths tied to
the property I'm investigating,

404
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,567
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

405
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:44,286
So, I hit the books
at the local library.

406
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:50,045
Searching through old records, I came
across an article about Wild Bill Hickok.

407
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:54,299
Turns out he was murdered right
next door to the Fairmont Hotel.

408
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,054
So, I'm heading over to the cemetery where
Wild Bill is buried to meet a historian.

409
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:03,215
He is gonna tell me exactly
what happened to him.

410
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,909
Kevin, through my research, I've found
out this Wild Bill Hickok got murdered,

411
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,589
literally, right next door to the
property that I'm investigating.

412
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,740
I know the name, it's famous, but I
really don't know anything about this guy.

413
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:19,133
- What about him?
- Here's a picture of him.

414
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:21,252
He died at age 39.

415
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,971
This is where he is buried,
at Mount Moriah Cemetery.

416
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:26,295
He was famous for being a lawman...

417
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:28,750
Settling some of the
Wild West communities,

418
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:32,027
and some shootouts in Missouri, as well.

419
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,514
So he was quick with the gun.

420
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,123
So, why does he come here?

421
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:38,367
He comes here to prospect and to mine,

422
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:41,056
but he also loved the
game of cards and gambling.

423
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:44,357
While he's here, I guess something happens
and he winds up getting murdered, right?

424
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,549
That's right.

425
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,597
Wild Bill comes into the Nuttal & Mann's
Saloon right next door to the Fairmont.

426
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,899
Sits down with his back to the door.

427
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,288
- Okay.
- Unusual for Wild Bill.

428
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,178
And then, a 25-year-old
named Jack McCall

429
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,115
comes in and shoots him
in the back of the head.

430
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,450
Kills him instantly, runs out the door.

431
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,500
Okay.

432
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:09,438
Here's the one photo that is considered
to be the photo of Jack McCall.

433
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:12,306
You said he was 25. This guy
looks like he'd be in his 40s.

434
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:15,399
In my opinion, there is no
known photo of Jack McCall.

435
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,123
- Does he get caught?
- Yeah.

436
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:23,024
He was taken, tried, convicted and found
guilty of murder, and sentenced to hang.

437
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,911
Four years later, they
moved the cemetery.

438
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:29,042
And when they moved the
cemetery, they open the casket,

439
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:34,203
and the noose is still
around Jack McCall's neck.

440
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:38,585
I'm seeing another guy that was hung.

441
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:42,537
He admitted that he is not a good man.

442
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:45,780
And I think it was an improper hanging.

443
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:49,469
Just from the pain that I've
been experiencing from him,

444
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,861
it was not done well and it
was excruciatingly painful.

445
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:56,784
- You know when he's from?
- 18...

446
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:59,125
80s, 1890s.

447
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,947
- Age?
- 24, but he does look older.

448
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:06,128
It really hurts a lot.

449
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:19,019
I saw several dead people on my walk.

450
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,799
But, the women being mistreated
in the basement stood out the most.

451
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,526
They were all nude.

452
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:26,811
How many?

453
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:29,096
About five.

454
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:34,708
Super skinny, some of them
looked really sickly and weak.

455
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,026
These women were...

456
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:39,487
Being abused.

457
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:43,832
Amy?

458
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:48,828
Yeah, that's what I saw.

459
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,201
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

460
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:18,936
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

461
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,670
Amy, I would like you to meet
Ron. Now, Ron owns this building.

462
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:25,673
And his dream is to turn this
historic place into a thriving hotel.

463
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:29,844
Problem is, every time he does some
construction, the activity here goes wild.

464
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:32,013
He's worried about his
guests and his employees.

465
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:34,434
Now, Kathleen here is
one of his employees.

466
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:35,993
She works downstairs at the bar.

467
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:38,926
She has had some very
frightening experiences.

468
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:42,123
And she's worried that Ron's not ever
gonna be able to fulfill his dream.

469
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:48,024
So, with that, I'm gonna ask
Amy to tell us about her walk.

470
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:54,431
When I first got here,
there were these five men who

471
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:57,771
came up to me in my opening
and they kind of surrounded me.

472
00:27:57,772 --> 00:28:01,341
They were my escorts
throughout the entire walk.

473
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:04,683
But all of them had been bad people.

474
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:08,824
And it went from thievery to murder.

475
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,652
What they are doing...

476
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:16,622
Here is they are actually
trying to protect people.

477
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:20,990
This is how they feel they're
going to make up for...

478
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:25,911
The things that they
did when they were alive.

479
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:30,122
One of them brought up the fact
that this is the city of the dead.

480
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,786
So, the individual that I worked with

481
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:36,642
and spoke with the most
was this younger male.

482
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:40,270
To me he looked like he'd
be in his early to mid 30s,

483
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:44,337
but he claimed to be much
younger, like in his early 20s.

484
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:46,979
I had a hard time
believing him about his age.

485
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,042
And he was hanged for whatever he did.

486
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:55,799
Um... and unfortunately,
his hanging did not go well.

487
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,329
A couple things you mentioned
reminded me of the most

488
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,453
famous murder that actually
took place in this town.

489
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:05,137
And it took place literally right next
door to the building here, in a saloon.

490
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:10,209
Wild Bill Hickok, who was a
famous lawman, gunslinger...

491
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,444
Actually, here's a picture of him.

492
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:13,891
This is Wild Bill Hickok.

493
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,192
He was in the saloon but he wound
up having his back to the door.

494
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:20,722
A young kid by the name of
Jack McCall, about 25, comes in.

495
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:23,440
He says, take that, and he puts
one in the back of his head.

496
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,628
Kills him instantly.

497
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,960
He's caught, trial, found
guilty and he's hung.

498
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:31,662
Now, you mentioned that
there was a bad hanging right?

499
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,965
The cemetery he is buried in, they
decided four years later to move.

500
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:37,562
So, they took all the bodies
and caskets and they moved them.

501
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,909
When they opened up his casket...

502
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,240
Apparently the hanging must've
went pretty rough and bad...

503
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:45,317
The noose was still on his neck.

504
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:48,971
This is a photo of who they
think may be Jack McCall.

505
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:52,259
The kid is supposed to be 25,
this guy looks much older than 25.

506
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,803
Oh, my God. Oh, he was 25?

507
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:57,786
Right, but then you said he looked
a lot older than what he was.

508
00:29:57,787 --> 00:29:59,691
Well, yeah he did.

509
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,299
Could he have been
this guy, Jack McCall?

510
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,720
That's what I'm thinking.

511
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,402
So, what else happened on your walk?

512
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:13,021
When I was standing in
front of the restaurant...

513
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:17,582
I felt and heard
another violent incident.

514
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:23,411
One man was yelling, like,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

515
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:26,518
And I felt like I was
staggering. And I felt anger.

516
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,821
- Now, you said the guy was staggering?
- Yes.

517
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:33,492
There actually was a man gunned down in
1949 right in front of the building here.

518
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:36,195
There was a guy by the
name of Johnny Gorham.

519
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:39,136
Now, Johnny was a middleweight champion.

520
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,762
- A boxer.
- Oh, my God.

521
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,702
There's a picture of him here.

522
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:47,273
He was also a Police
Officer in Deadwood.

523
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,194
What?

524
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:53,149
One night, he got drunk...

525
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,080
Went to a few bars, he
was punching people out.

526
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:59,905
They call the Police Chief to help
arrest him, who actually fired him.

527
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,388
Oh, he got fired?

528
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:05,190
He got fired for being drunk
on duty and for beating people.

529
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:07,793
Police Chief tells him to
stop, draws a service revolver.

530
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:09,405
Says, stop, don't move.

531
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:11,234
He starts cursing him,
you're a coward, you're

532
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:13,491
the one that fired me, you're all rats.

533
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:16,135
So he had anger towards
this guy, real anger.

534
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:19,405
Police Chief says, stop, stop, stop.
Boom, plants one right in his chest.

535
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:20,978
Damn.

536
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,295
Witnesses said that he kept going, because
you kept saying that you were staggering?

537
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:26,111
Yes.

538
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,209
He staggered right towards
him up until the end then fell.

539
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,450
- And then died.
- Wow.

540
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:36,895
I came inside.

541
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,396
And there were several
dead people who...

542
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:46,703
Were commenting, um,
negatively about the decor.

543
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:52,773
Basically, all of the dead have different
ideas about how this building should look.

544
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:56,043
It actually gave me
a really bad headache.

545
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,150
The reason we're here is that he can't
get any construction done because every

546
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:03,684
time they take a hammer and swing
it, there's... activity picks up here.

547
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:09,457
Yeah. Well, I've been trying to get the
building finished for quite some time.

548
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:13,499
And every time we seem to
get rolling right along to get

549
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,754
something done, we start
to have increased activity.

550
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:21,341
And the activity scares
off some of the contractors.

551
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,285
Oh, no.

552
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:28,186
And the employees, and then we
have to stop and regroup again.

553
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,692
So, what else is going on in
this place? What else you see?

554
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:36,562
One of the individuals that
was complaining about the

555
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:41,356
decor in the building was
this elderly woman that I met.

556
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:43,558
She is really tiny.

557
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,195
She is probably only, like,
five foot. On the heavier side.

558
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:51,096
She definitely worked a lot here.

559
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,928
I've seen her walking
through the Fairmont Hotel.

560
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,972
And then I've seen her stop
at the edge of the stage.

561
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,977
And just stare at me at the bar.

562
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:04,245
I've seen her several times.

563
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:07,219
She startles me if I come
up the back staircase,

564
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,150
because she is always
looking over the railing.

565
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:13,264
So I got in the habit
of saying, coming up.

566
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:16,926
Because, really, I don't want
to confront anything here.

567
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:20,370
Let me ask you a question, is it
possible it is the same woman you saw?

568
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,231
Yes.

569
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:24,399
Okay, so what else?

570
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,897
When I did a lot of
other walking around,

571
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:33,576
I finally made it down to the basement
and what I saw was kind of strange.

572
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:37,122
I saw several women who were...

573
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:40,882
Down there, and they were nude.

574
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:44,298
And at first I thought they
were hiding from someone.

575
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,400
But then, I figured out that they were
actually being put down there by someone.

576
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,216
- Really?
- Yes.

577
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:56,677
And I did hear, at times,
something about sex slavery.

578
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:01,246
Makes sense, though. This
building was built as a Brothel.

579
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:06,093
Because of the mining community here,
the ratio of men to women was 50 to 1.

580
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:08,161
The men that controlled
the prostitutes here did

581
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:10,391
whatever they wanted to
to keep them under control.

582
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:12,118
And when they didn't
do what they were told,

583
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,360
a lot of them, from what I
was told, would get beat up.

584
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,562
Well, I did do a sketch of that scene.

585
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:20,588
- You did?
- Yeah.

586
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:23,709
Pretty extreme, though.

587
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:32,259
- Oh, this is what you saw?
- Mm hmm.

588
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,927
That's just a few, though.

589
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:46,488
There's a terrible vibe in
that area, always has been.

590
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,428
I hate going down there
and getting supplies.

591
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,636
We try to avoid going
down there late at night.

592
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:53,662
So what is it that you
feel when you're down there?

593
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:57,083
Extraordinary sadness, pain.

594
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:58,679
Unpleasantness.

595
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,940
I want to get out as fast as I can.

596
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:08,532
When I came up to the second floor I...

597
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:12,228
Encountered a woman that I
think may have, at some point,

598
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:14,941
been in the basement, simply
because of her appearance.

599
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:17,244
She talks incessantly.

600
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,012
She probably worked here.

601
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:22,508
And I did get that she
did sleep with people.

602
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:26,349
It's very possible that the living...

603
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:31,692
Might hear some of the commotion
between her and the other dead people.

604
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:36,255
So, people could possibly
hear her still talking.

605
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:39,132
Kathleen actually stayed
here for about a week.

606
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,621
Tell her the experience you had.

607
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:46,522
A woman appeared at the foot of my
bed very briefly and just looked at me.

608
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,568
All of the hair stood up
on the back of my neck.

609
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:53,174
You seem to have run into
a lot of dead people here.

610
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,114
- Yes.
- Did you run into anybody else?

611
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:59,330
I was walking by a bedroom
on the third floor...

612
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:03,695
And I got that someone
had killed themselves.

613
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:07,116
Um, that it was a female.

614
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,360
She was hysterical.

615
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,298
Very, very sad.

616
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:17,701
And I felt like she had lost
someone very close to her.

617
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:22,371
And I got that she killed herself
in a very dramatic fashion.

618
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:27,129
That's about as accurate of
a hit that I've seen her get.

619
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,198
There was a prostitute back in
1907 named Maggie Broadwater.

620
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,138
Now, I have an article
here that describes

621
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:36,650
the way she killed
herself and what happened.

622
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:39,646
She was a prostitute that
worked here and lived here.

623
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:43,852
Now, the expert I talked to about this said
that she had a relationship that went bad.

624
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:46,878
And she took it hard
and started drinking,

625
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:50,076
heavily for about a week straight,
before she killed herself.

626
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:54,407
Now, you saw a woman when
you lived on the third floor.

627
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:55,640
Yes, I did.

628
00:36:55,641 --> 00:37:00,429
I saw a woman that fit almost exactly
the same description as she described.

629
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,536
And I woke in the middle
of the night and she

630
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:06,062
just stood there for
about four or five minutes.

631
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:08,474
And I never saw her after that.

632
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:11,380
- You did move out, right?
- I moved out.

633
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:16,907
I'm uneasy because I don't want
to be involved in the other side.

634
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,828
Okay.

635
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:20,944
What else did you see?

636
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:26,345
Then I met a character,
who I called the grumpy man.

637
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:31,467
He feels like he would like
the third floor to be...

638
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:34,145
An area just for the
dead people and that no

639
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:36,859
living people should
be allowed up there.

640
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,017
He does get extremely agitated
and occasionally does lash out.

641
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:44,608
He does things directed towards the
living that aren't particularly nice.

642
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:46,206
Like what?

643
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:49,639
He admitted to having broken
things in the building.

644
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,610
He does want to
physically harm the living.

645
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:59,511
He does not know how, but he
is trying to teach himself how.

646
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:19,282
He does get extremely agitated
and occasionally does lash out.

647
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:22,744
He does things directed towards the
living that aren't particularly nice.

648
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:24,202
Like what?

649
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:28,256
He admitted to having broken
things in the building.

650
00:38:28,257 --> 00:38:31,664
He does want to
physically harm the living.

651
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:37,565
He does not know how, but he
is trying to teach himself how.

652
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:44,158
That's not very pleasant.

653
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:46,270
I'm alone here at night.

654
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:49,701
I'm an older woman. It's alarming.

655
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,148
Does he act in a place other
than the second and third floor?

656
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:57,248
- Is he downstairs at the bar?
- He is capable to go anywhere.

657
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:00,042
It bothers me that I hear
that someone might want

658
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:03,449
to try to harm somebody
or do some mischief here.

659
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,411
Well, you've had investors that have stayed
overnight and physically had their...

660
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,920
Arm moved.

661
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,822
The first time it
happened, I had an investor

662
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:15,270
of mine who stayed up there to lay down.

663
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,411
And he came down a little bit uh...

664
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,528
Frightened.

665
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:23,436
And he said when he was
sleeping he was awoken

666
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:26,403
by somebody moving his
arm off of his chest.

667
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:31,046
Four or five other people have been in that
room and they all had the same experience.

668
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:36,947
That would be something that
this person is capable of doing.

669
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:44,929
Well, you guys have been hit
with a lot of information tonight.

670
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,119
But I think we kind of
know now why you're having

671
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,095
such a hard time getting
this place renovated.

672
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,558
The big question, though, is are you gonna
be able to fulfill your dream and turn this

673
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,082
into the hotel you wanted to, and keep
your staff, your guests, and yourself safe?

674
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:02,679
For that, I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy to see what she can tell us.

675
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,104
I believe that you can do
what you would like to do,

676
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:09,454
but it is going to take a bit of work.

677
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:13,084
So, not only do you have the dead that
people are coming into contact with.

678
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:16,311
But also all of this residual muck.

679
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:20,316
Because it's so dense, and
there's so many layers...

680
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,310
This is going to take about a year.

681
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,067
Doing cleansings one
to two times per week.

682
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:29,392
What kind of a cleansing
are we talking about?

683
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,714
What you need are basic things...

684
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:34,627
Salt, Sage, and holy water.

685
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:39,866
The first thing that you're going to do
would be getting some Sage, lighting it.

686
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:43,715
What this does is it removes the
buildup of the residual energy.

687
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:48,084
And then, I want you to take
some salt and water, mix it up,

688
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:53,985
put it into a spray bottle, and
then spray the floors and the walls.

689
00:40:54,105 --> 00:40:58,057
The holy water is going to prevent any

690
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:00,972
more negative individuals
from coming in.

691
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:06,873
What it will do is just create a
pure and kind of safe environment.

692
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:12,994
Once all of this has been done and it's
been about a year, you will see a change.

693
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,171
As far as how people feel, as
far as people's interactions.

694
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:21,373
The dead that occupy this
location... they'll be gone.

695
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:23,929
Will he start feeling a
difference sooner than a year?

696
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,070
Yes, but you have to keep doing it.

697
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:32,403
I feel validated, because
she's brought to light things

698
00:41:32,404 --> 00:41:37,722
that we have seen and it
gives us collective closure.

699
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:41,549
Now, I'm gonna ask the obvious
question, are you gonna do what she says?

700
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,073
What do you think?

701
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:44,546
I'll help.

702
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:47,967
Okay, there's your answer.

703
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,044
It won't be easy removing the layers of
dead people surrounding this location.

704
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:56,812
But if Ron and Kathleen follow my
advice, the dead will be set free.

705
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:02,713
And Ron will be able to fulfill his
dream and restore this historic hotel.
