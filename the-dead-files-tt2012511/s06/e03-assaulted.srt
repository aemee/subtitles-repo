1
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,679
He hates them.

2
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,614
He's always in a rage.

3
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,981
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

4
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:19,221
"You're mine. You can't escape."

5
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:21,299
There's a black mist
coming out of the wall.

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,501
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,673
He was pretty ruthless.

8
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,777
And I felt two hands, like that.

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,884
And it just goes whoosh.

10
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:32,930
Its goal is to kill all these women.

11
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,903
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:39,107
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:41,145
What's happening?

14
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:42,249
I see dead people.

15
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,725
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,369
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,370
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:49,539
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,677
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,655
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:56,664
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,271
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,540
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,545
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:03,651
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:06,858
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,061
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:09,531
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,807
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,542
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,579
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:16,782
Until the very end.

33
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,556
You got problems. I got news for you.

34
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,764
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,836
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:24,609
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,782
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38

39
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,529
I'm in Hanover, Pennsylvania,

40
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,396
about two hours outside of Philly.

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,269
I'm on my way to meet
with a woman named Deanna.

42
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,372
Now, she sounded really
desperate on the phone.

43
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:01,080
She thinks the house is
slowly trying to kill her.

44
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm hoping Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this

45
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:04,317
and help this woman out.

46
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:11,393
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,164
I look for any leading information.

48
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,035
Family photos and religious icons

49
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,705
could influence her findings,

50
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,110
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all

51
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:23,012
before she begins her walk.

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,542
There's something here,
but I don't know what it is.

53
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,678
I'm hearing it goes way, way back.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,883
It goes way, way, way back.

55
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:52,987
It affects the women mostly,

56
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,891
but it touches everyone around them.

57
00:02:55,893 --> 00:03:00,601
Either they lost their kids or
their husband or their lives.

58
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:08,546
And I think that its goal
is to kill all these women.

59
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,917
Deanna, you
sounded pretty hysterical

60
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,187
on the phone when we spoke.

61
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,890
Now that I'm here, I need you to tell me

62
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,125
what the hell is going on.

63
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,059
I want my home back.

64
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,461
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

65
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,965
I'm so tired of it. I'm so done of it.

66
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,668
What's going on?

67
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,971
I'm seeing apparitions.

68
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm seeing shadow figures.

69
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,576
We're seeing black mists.

70
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:38,978
I'm hearing growls.

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,816
I'm being bit, scratched.

72
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:44,218
The attacks that you've had,

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
how often do they happen?

74
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:46,788
Every day.

75
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,990
Geez.

76
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,357
Why don't you just move?

77
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,296
I'll be damned if anybody is
gonna run me out of my house.

78
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,196
We're gonna get this fixed.

79
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,766
Well, I like this attitude,
to be honest with you.

80
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,501
How long you living here?

81
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:01,702
Seven years.

82
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,936
Okay, and you live here with your husband.

83
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,170
Yes, Tom. And it's just the two of you?

84
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,072
Yes. Initially, my first
daughter lived here,

85
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:08,739
but she had to move out.

86
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,439
She had to move out?

87
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,940
She couldn't take it.

88
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,811
Okay, so, seven years
has this being going on,

89
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,513
or has it had progressively gotten worse?

90
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,848
It has progressively gotten worse.

91
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,015
I've got to the point

92
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,316
where I won't even sleep upstairs anymore.

93
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,884
I don't even sleep with my own husband.

94
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:24,386
Where are you sleeping?

95
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,622
I'm sleeping in the spare bedroom.

96
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,956
Okay, is it easier for you to sleep there?

97
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,489
No. I have no safe haven.

98
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,460
No matter where I go in this
house, I can't find relief.

99
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:40,634
I'm seeing this woman.

100
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,933
Oh...

101
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:50,039
Overwhelming panic, overwhelming fear,

102
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,407
and got to get away, got
to get out, got to get away.

103
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,874
This is a living woman?

104
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,342
Yes.

105
00:04:56,344 --> 00:05:01,410
Moving from room to room to
room to room, trying to be...

106
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,878
Well, if I go here, will this help it?

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,246
Will I go here, will this help it?

108
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,848
Will this make it stop?
Will this make it stop?

109
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,882
Will this make it stop?

110
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:10,151
And the thing...
this thing's saying,

111
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:11,821
"No, it doesn't matter where you are.

112
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,223
I'll find you. I'll find you."

113
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,792
Uh, "You're mine. You can't escape."

114
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:23,193
And I hear a deep male voice.

115
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:26,595
Is this the thing that tries to kill women?

116
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:28,029
Yes.

117
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,430
Ugh, I feel like he
comes up from the grave.

118
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:31,465
He was alive.

119
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,832
He was a... a
living person once.

120
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,239
Ah, this is...
it's very creepy.

121
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:41,477
It's very... this
is [bleep] creepy.

122
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,151
But did things get
better when you moved down here?

123
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:52,319
No.

124
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,988
Like, one time, I was laying on my side,

125
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,525
and as I was asleep,
I just felt a stroking,

126
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,226
just stroking my hair, stroking,

127
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,530
and then when I opened up my eyes to look,

128
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:06,835
there was this woman in
period dress, late 1800s.

129
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,303
She looks like a farmer

130
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:10,505
or some kind of, um, housekeeper.

131
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:12,908
Okay, so, if you saw a
sketch or a photo of her,

132
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,010
would you recognize her?

133
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:14,911
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

134
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,378
Anything else going on in here?

135
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,878
Yes.

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,214
When I wake up,

137
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:23,520
this is what I have on me
in the middle of my back.

138
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:26,023
Could you have possibly
done this to yourself

139
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,692
in the middle of the night?

140
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:30,262
No. This is as far as I can reach.

141
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:34,303
Is there anything else that
you are experiencing here?

142
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:37,107
Yes, I have this one particular dream

143
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:38,977
that just keeps recurring.

144
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,313
I'm in a cemetery,

145
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,148
and as I'm looking through the cemetery,

146
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,853
these five monks levitating, no feet,

147
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,652
come straight for me.

148
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:51,524
Then out of nowhere,
this, like, a shadow man.

149
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:54,460
He's super tall. He's got the black cloak.

150
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:58,061
He shot up from the ground, just pomp!

151
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:00,898
And at that point when he shot up,

152
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,266
I was pinned down,

153
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:05,301
and then I opened my eyes
like, "Deanna, it's a dream.

154
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,003
"Get out of this. It's a dream.

155
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,004
Wake up."

156
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,371
And when I woke up,

157
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:12,774
he was standing at the
at the side of the bed,

158
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:17,080
looking at me, about 7' tall, red eyes.

159
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,281
He had, like, a hat.

160
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:23,021
And as soon as you saw
him, you know it's evil.

161
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,422
What'd you do?

162
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:25,957
Oh, my God, I just started bawling,

163
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,226
put the covers over my head,

164
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,130
just, "Dear Lord, get him out. Get him out.

165
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,464
Dear Lord, please help me."

166
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,897
Then what?

167
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,499
Then he said, "Your Yahweh
cannot help you now."

168
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,001
What the hell is that?

169
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,003
It's another term for God.

170
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,708
She thinks they're dreams,
but they're not dreams.

171
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:48,377
She's [bleep] awake.

172
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,182
He holds her down, and he's
telling her, "I smell you.

173
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:55,017
I taste you. I've got you."

174
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,385
He comes to the side of the bed.

175
00:07:57,387 --> 00:08:00,960
He's always, like, over
her, hovering over her.

176
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,798
He manipulates how he's seen.

177
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,801
He can look like smoke.

178
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:11,707
He has a hat, a black hat.

179
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,845
His face is rotting.

180
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,080
He's smelling me.

181
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,851
It's giving me chills down my back,

182
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:24,187
but it really is very disturbing.

183
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,122
Oh

184
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:43,944
And this is the room

185
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,612
you used to sleep in with your husband.

186
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:46,545
That's correct.

187
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:47,946
So, now what would happen up here

188
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,344
that you're not sleeping up here?

189
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,445
I was coming up the steps,

190
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,580
and then I felt two hands just, like that.

191
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:54,781
- So, that hard?
- That hard.

192
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,386
I was shoved, and I just fell right off.

193
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,123
I mean, my feet were kicked
off, and I hit the wall.

194
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,992
And I landed on the floor down there.

195
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,060
I couldn't breathe.

196
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,728
The wind had been knocked out of me.

197
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,894
It felt like something
was just sitting on me.

198
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:15,599
I could not move, and
I had excruciating pain.

199
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,267
You must be frightened every time

200
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,568
- you've got to come up these stairs now.
- Yeah.

201
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,710
It feels like somebody's
literally going like,

202
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,878
"Oh, you're not coming up here.

203
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,312
Oh, no, you don't."

204
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:36,081
Like, I just feel that coming
down the stairs towards me.

205
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,031
Oh, this is...

206
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,342
I'm seeing the sniffy guy.

207
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,912
He's much more aggressive downstairs.

208
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:06,251
Here, he's almost like a seducing,

209
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:09,752
like, soothing, but it's bad.

210
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,253
It's fake.

211
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:15,789
It's so he can figure you out...

212
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,561
and he can destroy you.

213
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,730
Tom, I was talking to your wife, Deanna,

214
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:44,865
and, uh, she told me

215
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:47,268
about the horrific things
she's going through.

216
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,969
Now, you guys aren't
even sleeping together,

217
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,838
really, anymore, right?
She's sleeping downstairs?

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,471
Right, she's sleeping downstairs now, yep.

219
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:55,273
It takes its toll on, uh, me.

220
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,275
I'm sure it's taking its toll on her.

221
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,578
And what about moving?

222
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,144
- You ever take that into consideration?
- No.

223
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:03,178
Nobody's gonna tell me
to get out of my house.

224
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,046
Are... are you
a skeptic at all?

225
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,784
Certain things, I can't find
a reason for or an answer for.

226
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,152
Okay.

227
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,387
I'm skeptical, but, yeah,

228
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,123
I'd still like to find
the answers to things.

229
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,658
Okay, but you've had some
experiences, is that right?

230
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,926
Yes.

231
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:18,262
I hear footsteps and
then, I don't see anything.

232
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:19,730
Where'd you hear the footsteps?

233
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,833
Uh, it sounded like they
were walking on the roof

234
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:23,203
when we were in the bedroom.

235
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,805
And when we're in the family room,

236
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:27,173
it sounds like they're going
up and down the steps here

237
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,810
to the basement and to the bedroom.

238
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,148
Do you ever think somebody's
breaking into the house?

239
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,483
I don't think that, 'cause
I do have a security system.

240
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,486
I would know if somebody
broke into the house.

241
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,422
Okay. Has anything else like that happened?

242
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:40,757
Deanna and I were upstairs in the bedroom,

243
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,261
sitting and talking one
time, and, uh, I heard voices.

244
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,028
Like, I would say something,
and it would repeat.

245
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,329
And she would say something,
it would repeat it,

246
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,862
like, mocking us.

247
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:49,996
That I can't explain, 'cause I heard it.

248
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,130
She heard it.

249
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:52,698
Was anybody else in
the house with you guys?

250
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,866
No, just her and I.

251
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:55,267
It couldn't have been
somebody from outside.

252
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,602
They wouldn't have been able to hear you.

253
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:57,903
Right, and they wouldn't
have been able to repeat

254
00:11:57,905 --> 00:11:59,171
what we were saying 'cause
they wouldn't have heard us.

255
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:10,211
I hate it down here. I hate it.

256
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:14,680
I see, like, a teenage girl

257
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,215
getting the [bleep] beat out of her.

258
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:17,684
By who?

259
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,455
It's a short man.

260
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,890
Uh, he's kind of pudgy.

261
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,327
He has, like, some kind of job

262
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,401
that puts him in a position
of power over people.

263
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:32,904
Oh! Oh, oh!

264
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,278
I think this man has a
heart attack here and dies.

265
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,816
This is a different guy than
the... the guy, the other guy.

266
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:42,884
He's always...

267
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:45,054
It's... it's like
you can hear this guy,

268
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,123
ah, 'cause he's always yelling.

269
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,295
You'll hear, like, him, like,
stomping around down here,

270
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:54,632
or, like, causing a ruckus, like, yelling.

271
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:55,833
He's angry, this one.

272
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,803
He's, like, always [bleep] angry.

273
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,472
I feel like he's gonna attack me,

274
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,508
like he's gonna beat the [bleep] out of me.

275
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,749
What's going on up here?

276
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,886
Deanna and I were sitting
at the kitchen table,

277
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,188
and she was telling me

278
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,724
about all the bruises
she's had on her arms.

279
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,526
And I was just kidding, said,

280
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,896
"Oh, it's probably the
ghost did that to you."

281
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:23,631
And it wasn't long, I said,
"Hey, I feel a burn on my arm."

282
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,233
And I had a long-sleeve shirt on,

283
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,334
rolled up the sleeve,

284
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,169
and I had a single scratch mark across it.

285
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,402
What about the cats?

286
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:31,237
- Were you playing with the cats at all?
- No.

287
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,272
No, and our cats are declawed,

288
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:33,372
so they couldn't have scratched.

289
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,173
Anything else?

290
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,177
We were sitting in the family room,

291
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,312
and the cats were here in the kitchen,

292
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,445
making weird noises.

293
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:41,411
So, we both got up.

294
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,179
Deanna turned the kitchen light on,

295
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,781
and coming out, like, right in this area,

296
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,045
there was, like, a black
mist coming out of the wall,

297
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,545
and it wasn't long, it just, hanging there.

298
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,278
And then, it just started
twirling like a tornado,

299
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,747
and it went right up.

300
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:59,451
I think the spot's still
there today, right up in there.

301
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,785
I can see it.

302
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,950
Have you tried painting over that or...

303
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,618
We did try painting over it.

304
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,253
It didn't... it
doesn't cover it.

305
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:07,688
Has anything else happened in here?

306
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,957
I get foul odors every so often,

307
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,591
and it smells like urine,

308
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,662
fecal odors, and kerosene
every once in a while.

309
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,928
No septic tank problems
or anything like that?

310
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,561
Nope, we're on, uh, town sewer.

311
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:20,865
No problems with the pipes
backing up or anything?

312
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,367
No, never a problem with that.

313
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,502
You walk into it,

314
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:25,104
and it just kind of takes your breath away.

315
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,576
What is this thing?

316
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,446
Oof.

317
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:39,148
Like a rush.

318
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:45,055
I see, like, this person
comes out of that room,

319
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,658
is like, "Hello."

320
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,860
"Uh-huh," goes in here,
is, like, walking out here,

321
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:52,799
and then all of a sudden,
like, the door flies open,

322
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:56,936
and the living people
here see a black mist.

323
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,940
This is the angry guy from the basement,

324
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:02,778
and it's stinky, a really bad smell.

325
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:06,687
And it just goes whoosh at the person.

326
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,222
He has hostility toward women.

327
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,359
Yep.

328
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:15,796
I feel like he's capable
of harming someone.

329
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:38,348
One of the first calls I
made was to a local author

330
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,018
who knows Hanover's history
backwards and forwards.

331
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,721
He told me the original settler
of Tom and Deanna's property

332
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,158
was literally destroyed by the land.

333
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,362
I'm heading over to meet with
him now to see what he means.

334
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,739
The original settler was
a man named John Digges.

335
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:07,947
He was an upper crust,
connected, well-to-do person

336
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:10,082
from Maryland, owned
some plantations there.

337
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:15,947
He was granted 10,000
acres of land in 1727.

338
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:20,253
This whole 10,000 acres
was called Digges' Choice.

339
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:22,887
Where on this map would
my clients' house be?

340
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,257
Right here.

341
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,925
Okay.

342
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,196
He had a fairly sizable
plantation that he farmed,

343
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,166
but he also wanted to
sell the rest of the land

344
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,004
and make as much money
as he could off of it.

345
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:38,675
The problem was, there were other settlers

346
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:42,080
that were coming in along
the edges of this property

347
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:44,182
instead of buying land from him.

348
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:45,815
He didn't like that very much.

349
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,650
Okay.

350
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,119
So, sometimes, he would try
to make them pay for the land.

351
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,853
Sometimes, he'd try to force them out.

352
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:56,494
He and his sons would go out with guns

353
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,597
- and try to run 'em off.
- Wow.

354
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,366
- He was pretty ruthless...
- Okay.

355
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:02,500
With the way he enforced it.

356
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,049
I'm seeing the sniffy
guy when he was alive.

357
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,557
Can you describe him?

358
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,659
Uh...

359
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,696
Power.

360
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,235
I feel, like, judgment.

361
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:37,778
Or he felt he could judge
and, um, control people.

362
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,048
Yeah, I see him.

363
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,985
I see him, I see him, I see an older man.

364
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:49,587
He had this power to
control their destinies,

365
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,323
and that's what he's still doing.

366
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,862
And... and he says,
"I could smell it.

367
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:58,265
I could smell it, and I
could taste it on them."

368
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,368
Smell what?

369
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,401
Oh, fear.

370
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:03,770
He hates them.

371
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,707
He [bleep] hates them.

372
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:09,638
Now, Jan, you mentioned on the phone

373
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,408
that the land basically destroyed Digges.

374
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,644
What did you mean by that?

375
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:16,712
Well, in 1752, Digges sent his two sons

376
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,812
to intimidate one of the settlers,

377
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,046
Martin Kitzmiller,

378
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,653
that Digges felt was
trespassing, basically.

379
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:27,823
So, Martin calls for a son
of his, his name was Jacob,

380
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,291
to come help him.

381
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:31,891
He came with a shotgun,

382
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:35,493
and in a struggle between Dudley Digges,

383
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:38,429
one of John's sons, and Jacob,

384
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,096
the gun accidentally went off,

385
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,698
and Dudley was shot and killed.

386
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay.

387
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:47,138
Here's an article that
appeared in the "York" paper

388
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,307
a couple of days after the shooting.

389
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,442
Martin and Jacob Kitzmiller

390
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:55,446
immediately turned
themselves in to authorities.

391
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:58,148
There was a coroner's inquest and a trial,

392
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,888
and basically, the trial
destroys John Digges.

393
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,294
The two people that he
thought murdered his son

394
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,462
are acquitted.

395
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:08,762
They were acquitted?

396
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,263
- Yes, it was considered accidental.
- Okay.

397
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,232
And the judge ruled

398
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,634
that most of this land wasn't even his.

399
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:18,134
Wow. Added insult to injury.

400
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,902
It... it
breaks him.

401
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:22,405
So, now, what happens
with... with Digges?

402
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:26,410
He moves shortly after
the murder to Maryland,

403
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:30,914
pretty much broke, and dies in 1760.

404
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,985
Do we know where he's buried at all?

405
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:35,020
All we know is he died in Maryland.

406
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:38,594
Okay. Now, do we know
where Dudley's buried?

407
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:41,930
Yes, he's buried on the
property, Digges' Choice.

408
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:52,168
It's one person alone in here.

409
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:56,907
Buried. He's buried very
close, very, very close.

410
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,290
I'm seeing blood.

411
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,363
Where?

412
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,029
On the walls.

413
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:23,069
It's making me anxious.
It's making me anxious.

414
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,171
Uh...

415
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,672
I feel trapped. I feel scared.

416
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,072
I feel like I can't breathe.

417
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:32,007
I feel like I'm choking on my tongue.

418
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,940
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

419
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:40,776
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

420
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,906
So far, I've got a family

421
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:59,079
that's being terrorized
by unexplained activity

422
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:03,188
in a property that's been
the cause of bloodshed.

423
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,294
But I need to see if there's anything else.

424
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:08,232
Searching through old property records,

425
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,514
I find a woman named Lydia Small,

426
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:11,745
who used to live on my clients' land.

427
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:14,683
Turns out, she lost four
children to drowning accidents,

428
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:18,220
three of them in the same quarry.

429
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:21,522
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

430
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:24,958
who says Lydia Small's
suffering on my clients' property

431
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,127
didn't even end there.

432
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,036
Well, Stephanie, thanks for meeting me.

433
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:39,004
I came across these articles
about this woman, Lydia,

434
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,846
who lost four kids to drowning.

435
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:43,577
Yes, yes, she did. The
first one was in 1890.

436
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,146
It was her daughter, who
was, um, a year and a half.

437
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:49,981
They had had a well in the backyard.

438
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:53,386
The little girl wandered out
and fell down into the well.

439
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:55,521
That was the first of the four.

440
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,221
The second incident, sadly,

441
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:59,455
involved two of Lydia's children.

442
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:01,221
Her 4-year-old
son, Dewey,

443
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:04,486
and her 7-year-old daughter,
Florence, were playing

444
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,688
down by the edge of the quarry.

445
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,921
Dewey fell in.

446
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:11,024
Their older sister, Irene, who was 12,

447
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:12,593
jumped in to try to save him,

448
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:14,427
and both of those children drowned.

449
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,827
All right.

450
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,495
So, that's three drownings,
but what was the fourth one?

451
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:20,396
The fourth one was Florence.

452
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:23,565
She and her mother were
along the edge of the quarry,

453
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,667
once again, picking raspberries,

454
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,300
and Florence, too, had
fallen into the quarry

455
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:31,866
and unfortunately drowned.

456
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,066
So, let me get this straight.

457
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:34,966
She loses three kids to
drowning, two in the quarry,

458
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:37,167
- and she takes another kid near it.
- Yes.

459
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,437
So now, you mentioned on the phone

460
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:42,774
that she had a lot worse
tragedy in her life.

461
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:45,307
The drownings of her four
children were just the start.

462
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,279
In 1907, she had a son.

463
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,682
His name was John Jacob,

464
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:53,055
and he died of what was at
the time called convulsions.

465
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:55,324
And then sadly, shortly thereafter,

466
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:57,326
she lost her husband, as well.

467
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,128
He worked at the quarry

468
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,530
and was actually crushed to death

469
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:04,400
when a cable car full of bricks came back

470
00:23:04,402 --> 00:23:06,735
and fell on him and crushed him.

471
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,035
So now, after all this
tragedy with this woman,

472
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:10,669
what ended up happening to her?

473
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:15,736
Well, on April 18th of 1939,
Lydia herself passed away.

474
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:19,472
This is the notice that
appeared in the newspaper.

475
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:21,910
She just wore out after
dealing with the loss

476
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:24,677
and the hardship that she'd
suffered all those years.

477
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,778
Her body just eventually gave out.

478
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:33,984
There's a woman that's,
like, really losing it,

479
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,653
like, losing her [bleep]

480
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,820
Uh, she's just always, like, crying,

481
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:41,255
and then I see a casket coming out.

482
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:44,158
I see a casket coming out,
and then I see this woman...

483
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,828
Just a mess.

484
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,032
It's almost like she goes into denial.

485
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:53,969
"That... that didn't happen.
It didn't happen, no."

486
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:04,643
I think there's a lot
of things that happened

487
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,645
one right after the other here.

488
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,182
I think she lost somebody.

489
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,451
I think she gets sick.

490
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:18,094
It's like she might have made herself sick

491
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,996
from not getting over everything.

492
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:25,032
I feel, like, this illness in her body,

493
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:27,398
like her stomach is affected.

494
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
She wastes away, but I don't know

495
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:32,802
if that's, like, from her emotional loss.

496
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,270
Right.

497
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,807
Because I feel this extreme
anger and this extreme sadness.

498
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,283
I encountered many entities during my walk,

499
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:53,054
but two stood out the most.

500
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,592
First, the crying woman.

501
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,190
You could see more of
the whites at the bottom.

502
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,725
A very high forehead.

503
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:07,391
Thicker here, and then,
they taper off pretty thin.

504
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,727
Next, I described the creepy man

505
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,030
tormenting a living woman in her bedroom.

506
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:15,329
The bed sits catty-corner.

507
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:20,101
This male comes out, but
it's like smoke, mist.

508
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:25,008
He is leaning over her.

509
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,879
It's very strange looking,
very creepy looking.

510
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,150
Is that what you saw?

511
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:33,986
Yes, that's what I saw.

512
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,047
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

513
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,845
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

514
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,944
and our clients for the first time.

515
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:06,345
Amy, I'd like you to meet Deanna and Tom.

516
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,081
They're married. They live in this house.

517
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,214
They've been living
through hell, basically.

518
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:12,518
In the last few years,
it's gotten real physical.

519
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,753
It's affecting their health

520
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,455
and, actually, their
marriage at this point,

521
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,356
and that's why they called us in for help.

522
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:20,254
So, now that Amy knows just a little bit

523
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:21,553
about what's going on,

524
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,354
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

525
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:24,739
One of the things that I got

526
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,741
when I first came into the home

527
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:34,680
was that this house is
extremely unsafe for women.

528
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:41,723
Women in this area have been
affected for a very long time,

529
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,025
and bad things will happen.

530
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:49,364
And then, I saw a lot of
dead women who are suffering.

531
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,399
But the one that stood out the most to me

532
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,069
was freaking out, crying.

533
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:58,207
She was, like, yelling a
lot, and then the door opened,

534
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:02,612
and a casket came out of the front door.

535
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:06,248
What I gathered from her
freaking out and yelling

536
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,953
was that, whoever that
person was who died, she felt,

537
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:13,020
you know, it was... it
was extremely sudden.

538
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,756
So, I felt, in the end,

539
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:21,463
she became sick from not
dealing with this death.

540
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,798
There was a woman that
lived on your property line.

541
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,801
Her name was Lydia Small.

542
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:30,367
This is a stack of articles
regarding her loss in life.

543
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,466
What?!

544
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:34,167
She lived here?

545
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,601
She lived on the property line.

546
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,938
1890, she had a daughter, 20 months old,

547
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,140
I think the kid was,

548
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,374
drowned in the well right on the property.

549
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:45,543
1902, her 4-year-old
son, Dewey,

550
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:48,279
and her 7-year-old
daughter, Florence,

551
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:50,950
were playing by the quarry, swimming.

552
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,583
Dewey goes under.

553
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:55,484
The 12-year-old sister,
Irene, jumps into the water

554
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:57,816
to rescue her brother, and she drowned.

555
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:58,816
Oh, my gosh.

556
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:00,049
They find their two bodies later on.

557
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,850
So, now, she lost three kids to drowning.

558
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,384
Oh, my gosh.

559
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:05,085
It gets worse.

560
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,917
1905, the kid, Florence,

561
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,986
was picking berries right by the quarry.

562
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,353
She falls in. She drowns.

563
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,690
So, that's four kids died of drowning.

564
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,359
Let's move over to 1907.

565
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,425
Now she loses an
18-month-old to convulsions,

566
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,896
probably from a high fever, I would assume.

567
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:24,763
The year after this happens,
her husband, Jeremiah,

568
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:29,869
who worked at the quarry
sending limestone rock

569
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:31,337
up to the top of the quarry.

570
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:34,171
Well, the cable snapped and
came down and crushed him.

571
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,340
Oh, my gosh.

572
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,008
Now, the whole tragedy with
Lydia and what she went through,

573
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,576
she winds up dying in 1939,

574
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:44,048
and I think the whole thing just
took a toll on her and she...

575
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,586
Her body just deteriorated down to nothing.

576
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:47,719
It's pretty sad.

577
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:51,491
Now, you see a woman, right?

578
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:52,561
Yes.

579
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:57,062
This woman is, just like you said,

580
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:04,771
just like I told you, very thin, sickly.

581
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,439
So, do you think this is the woman you saw?

582
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:08,840
I don't know, uh, but I did do a sketch.

583
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:26,058
Wow.

584
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,492
That's her.

585
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,360
That's who I see.

586
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:36,629
Ooh.

587
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:39,669
It's all coming together.

588
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:44,104
I would tell Tom of my stories,

589
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,405
and I'm sharing with him.

590
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,439
He's trying to connect to me.

591
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,540
Right.

592
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,475
- But he can't.
- Right.

593
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:55,614
It's not affecting him like it is me.

594
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:59,151
It justifies what I've been going through,

595
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:00,888
hell, all this time.

596
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,390
And how do you feel about it?

597
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:05,761
I don't know how to answer that.

598
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,466
It's putting a face to things she tells me,

599
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:09,936
but I don't relate to it

600
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:12,104
because it doesn't affect me, personally.

601
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,703
It affects her.

602
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:14,871
It makes me feel bad for that woman.

603
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,778
What else you see?

604
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,278
I started walking down the stairs,

605
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,248
and in front of me, there was a male.

606
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,785
And what I saw was, he was
beating up a teenage girl.

607
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:35,589
This man had and has a lot of issues

608
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:38,391
and anger, uh, towards and with women.

609
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:40,092
You can hear this guy.

610
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:44,161
You'll hear, like, him, like,
stomping around down here

611
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:47,600
or, like, causing a
ruckus, like, yelling...

612
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,202
And he shows himself like a black mist,

613
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,669
uh, smoke.

614
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,070
Oh, my God.

615
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:56,109
And I was upstairs,

616
00:30:56,111 --> 00:31:00,513
and I smelled this horrible stench,

617
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:04,921
and it was him.

618
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:08,659
We see this big, black
mist coming from the wall,

619
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,697
and then, in matter of seconds,

620
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:13,098
it turned into, like, a tornado, like,

621
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,198
and went straight up into the ceiling.

622
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,570
Matter of fact, there's still a mark there

623
00:31:17,572 --> 00:31:19,573
from where it went into the ceiling.

624
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:20,773
Yes.

625
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:23,208
Now, you also mentioned
to me about the smells.

626
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,510
I smell, like, either...

627
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:26,881
smells of urine sometimes, sometimes fecal,

628
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:29,117
and sometimes, I get kerosene.

629
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,822
Yeah. It's pretty nasty, yeah.

630
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:35,390
Well, you've seen a
lot on your walk so far.

631
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:37,657
- Anything else go on?
- Yes.

632
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,559
The person who was in the basement

633
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:44,163
is not the main culprit here.

634
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,564
Wow.

635
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:48,633
It was actually an individual
I met on the first floor,

636
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:51,802
a male, and what he does is,

637
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:55,709
he literally crawls up out of the grave.

638
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:59,814
He is extremely creepy.

639
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:03,953
He sniffed all the way up my back,

640
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:10,395
and it just was really disgusting,

641
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:13,062
horrifying, degrading.

642
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,998
And I was scared,

643
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,705
and that's really unusual for me.

644
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:22,340
He really hates women, and what he told me

645
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:25,007
when, ugh, he got up to my ear was,

646
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,473
he was like, "I can taste
it, and I can smell it."

647
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:32,509
When I started going
up to the room upstairs,

648
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,714
I felt someone pushing me back,

649
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:38,019
holding me back at the
bottom of the stairs,

650
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,856
like, a wall going up and,
like, two hands coming out

651
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,660
and pushing me and being like,

652
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,760
"Oh, no, you are not coming up here."

653
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,996
Well, that's one of the
big reasons we're here.

654
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,933
Deanna, tell Amy what happened to you.

655
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:51,536
One night, I was going
up the steps to go to bed,

656
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:53,571
and I was walking up the steps,

657
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,676
I just stopped because I felt him.

658
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:58,043
It was ferocious,

659
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:01,013
and he just came up with such a force,

660
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:02,582
and just went vroom,

661
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:07,619
and I flew off the steps
and skid into the kitchen.

662
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,854
She had a fractured tailbone.

663
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,322
Oh, wow.

664
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,524
She actually moved into
the downstairs bedroom...

665
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,626
Yes...'cause she's afraid
to go upstairs and go to sleep.

666
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:17,095
Really?

667
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,964
Because I did see a woman

668
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,434
who was going from bedroom to bedroom,

669
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:24,635
trying to get away from him,

670
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:28,577
and one of the things that I
heard him saying to her was,

671
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,811
"I've got you.

672
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:32,515
You're mine. There's no escape."

673
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:37,522
I know he can manipulate the way he's seen.

674
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:41,224
I saw him at one point coming out as a mist

675
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,926
from under the bed,

676
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:44,896
coming up to the side of the bed.

677
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,065
There was a female laying in the bed.

678
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:51,301
He then took on this form
that I saw him with the hat,

679
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:54,839
and he was pushing down on her shoulders,

680
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:59,545
and he was saying, uh,
you know, "I've got you.

681
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,750
I smell you. I taste you. I know you."

682
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:06,520
The impression I got was that
the living woman in the bed

683
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,519
thinks that she's having dreams,

684
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,156
but it's actually happening.

685
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:12,796
Oh, my God, Amy.

686
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:15,401
In that bedroom, just like you said,

687
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,638
I was having a dream,
and I'm in a cemetery.

688
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,977
And five monks levitating, hooded,

689
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:26,449
they come before me, and then they stop.

690
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:33,830
But this man shot up, huge,
masculine, hat, red eyes.

691
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:36,630
I felt him just jump right on me,

692
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,601
held me down, and then
when I opened up my eyes,

693
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:43,772
he's standing right
there, just looking at me.

694
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:47,910
And he told me that nobody
can help me now, I was his.

695
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,752
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

696
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:58,323
Ooh.

697
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,772
Yeah. That's him.

698
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:13,441
Amy, that's him.

699
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:34,511
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

700
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:40,084
Ooh.

701
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,532
Yeah. That's him.

702
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,434
Amy, that's him.

703
00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:00,171
That's him.

704
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:04,175
Oh, my God, Tom.

705
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:05,776
That's the man I told you about.

706
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,948
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

707
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,519
Then, when he's got a hold on you, Amy,

708
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:19,325
he doesn't let you go until he decides.

709
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,562
There's no begging. There's no pleading.

710
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:24,397
The more upset I get,

711
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,698
the more he's enjoying
the cat and mouse game.

712
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,266
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's how he operates.

713
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:35,006
Now, she wakes up in the morning,

714
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:36,207
she's got bruises, scratches...

715
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:40,510
Matter of fact, here's
some of the scratches

716
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,510
we're talking about.

717
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:46,012
Oh, wow.

718
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:50,515
Now, is this thing capable of causing this?

719
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:52,049
Sure, yes. Oh, yes.

720
00:36:57,054 --> 00:36:59,156
- This guy was alive at one time?
- Yes.

721
00:36:59,158 --> 00:37:01,259
Do you know anything about
him or who he might be or...

722
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,565
Yeah. He was probably
about in his 60s or 70s.

723
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,839
He was absolutely in a power position

724
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:11,911
where he was able to judge others

725
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,514
and had the power to control,
like, their destinies.

726
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:18,387
He did terrible things throughout his life.

727
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:20,926
He is attached to the property,

728
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:24,295
and I think where I saw him
coming up out of the grave

729
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:25,631
is relatively close.

730
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:30,399
He was buried near here.

731
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:35,167
Well, I got to think about
this one a little bit,

732
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,066
but the original guy that owned
the place was a wealthy guy.

733
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:41,032
Um, his name was John Digges.

734
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:43,269
As a matter of fact, I have a map here

735
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:45,502
which was originally called Digges' Choice.

736
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,868
Now, this is 10,000 acres here.

737
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,937
Oh, my goodness.

738
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,443
Your property is right about here.

739
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:55,180
It goes back to the early 1700s.

740
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:58,815
This guy was granted
this... this land.

741
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:02,986
So, he was a powerful guy and ruthless,

742
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,553
you know, in the way he did his business.

743
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:07,956
When people tried to encroach
on his property and settle,

744
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:11,593
he forcibly either removed them
from his property at gunpoint,

745
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:13,598
or he made them pay.

746
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,171
Later on, in 1752, there was
a family called Kitzmillers

747
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,742
that landed on the property,

748
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:22,646
and he sent his son, Dudley, to
try to intimidate these people.

749
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,416
And a fight ensued over a gun,

750
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,485
and the son, Dudley, was shot and killed.

751
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:31,155
So, for John Digges,
after his son gets killed,

752
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,258
uh, basically, things go from bad to worse.

753
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,995
Once this case goes to court,

754
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:40,099
the judge acquits the
Kitzmiller kid for the murder,

755
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:43,467
and then tells John Digges, "Guess what,

756
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,137
most of this land here is not yours,"

757
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,804
and winds up taking it away from him.

758
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:50,538
He ended up broken and broke, basically.

759
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,306
Now, we don't know where he's buried,

760
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:54,742
but I know the son, Dudley,
was buried on the property.

761
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:56,743
Yeah, that is interesting. Okay.

762
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,315
So, what does he want?

763
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:05,454
His one main goal is to
go after the women here.

764
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:08,159
He said, "I'll go after their kids.

765
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:10,263
- I'll go after their husbands."
- Hmm.

766
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,572
He likes to, like, drive
them to, basically, madness.

767
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:23,983
The end goal is to actually have a death.

768
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:26,552
Oh, my gosh.

769
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,221
So, this Lydia Small thing,
with all these kids that died,

770
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:33,827
I mean, do you think this thing
had anything to do with that?

771
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,695
Yes. I think so, mm-hmm.

772
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:38,296
Is he trying to kill her?

773
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,498
Yes.

774
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,643
For years, you guys have been in a fight

775
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:55,879
against something you can't
even see, but, you know,

776
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:57,714
after our investigation,
at least now you know

777
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,149
who and what you're up against.

778
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:02,320
But we still haven't
answered your big question...

779
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:04,554
Is this a fight you guys can win?

780
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:06,457
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

781
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,065
So, the first thing that needs to happen

782
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:18,039
is a male witch who's also a medium

783
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,173
needs to be called in here.

784
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:24,277
This person needs to be
a very dominant male type,

785
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,580
the bigger, the better.

786
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,254
Why does he have to be physically big?

787
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:36,001
Because he's intimidated
by males who are masculine.

788
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:41,606
So, day one, this witch needs to come in,

789
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:45,913
and he needs to call all
of the dead women to him.

790
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:50,287
And then, he and these dead women

791
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:55,461
are going to summon the evil dead male.

792
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:57,798
You cannot be here.

793
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,037
They are going to put him
where needs to be forever,

794
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,506
where he can do no more
harm to anyone ever again.

795
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:12,911
Day two, he needs to then

796
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:18,283
assist any of the females
that are dead who want to go.

797
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:22,555
He's going to assist them
to make that transition.

798
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:26,393
Day three, he now needs to come down here

799
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:29,833
and get rid of this
individual in your basement.

800
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,933
Does that banish him just from
here or from the whole area?

801
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,837
Oh, it'll get rid of
him from the whole area.

802
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,206
Yes!

803
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,142
It's a little bit better
news than I was expecting,

804
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:39,177
to be honest with you.

805
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,380
I feel a lot better,

806
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:42,349
because it sounds like
a solution's in order.

807
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,187
Oh, relieved.

808
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:45,389
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

809
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:47,056
Yes.

810
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:49,889
Okay. Absolutely, starting tonight.

811
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:50,824
Absolutely.

812
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,461
I really hope Deanna
and Tom follow my advice

813
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:57,962
and rid their home of the
evil that's tormenting them.

814
00:41:57,964 --> 00:42:01,301
I'm worried that if they
don't deal with it immediately,

815
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:04,136
their suffering could continue,
and they might never find peace.
