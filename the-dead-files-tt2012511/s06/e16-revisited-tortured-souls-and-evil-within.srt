1
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,539
"Get away from me."

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,209
NARRATOR: Tonight
on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,709
You got some crazy going on.

4
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:14,013
NARRATOR:...a second look
at some of Amy and Steve's

5
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,212
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,883
Sounds a like
a real serious problem.

7
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:18,068
New information.

8
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,183
TOM: I braced myself

9
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,985
for what I was gonna hear.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,721
NARRATOR:
Startling revelations.

11
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,388
I don't want something taking

12
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,424
one of my family members
from me.

13
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:30,396
NARRATOR: First, a return
to Manchester, Connecticut...

14
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,098
We can't live like this
any longer.

15
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,134
...where a deranged stalker...

16
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,100
She's running from someone.

17
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,437
NARRATOR:
...attacks from beyond.

18
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,038
I think he wants to kill.

19
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,572
NARRATOR: Then...

20
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,476
I'm very worried that
my children are gonna be hurt.

21
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,346
...we travel back
to St. Clair Shores, Michigan...

22
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,148
AMY:
This is not good.

23
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,285
NARRATOR:...where a family's
biggest threat...

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,154
I think it's a poltergeist.

25
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,923
NARRATOR:
...is one of their own.

26
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,076
I feel like it's my fault.

27
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,159
Did they listen to Amy?

28
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,763
Can you fix
what's going on?

29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,333
Or does the terror continue?

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,904
I exorcise thee
by the most holy name

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,106
of Eloah Va-Daath!

32
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,041
It's really bad in here.

33
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,411
My name is Amy Allan.

34
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,781
Something is not right.

35
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,347
I see dead people.

36
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,451
This person might have been
a serial killer.

37
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,351
I speak to dead people.

38
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,920
You get those chills.

39
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,488
And they speak to me.

40
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,924
He is darkness.
He is evil.

41
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,062
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

42
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,795
I think she broke her neck.

43
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,281
I rely on my partner.

44
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,732
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

45
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,935
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

46
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,401
You telling me the truth?

47
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:48,074
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

48
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,542
I think the devil
is down here.

49
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,927
It's my job to reveal them.

50
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,837
Who the hell would do this?

51
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,678
But Steve and I never speak...

52
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,782
We never communicate
during an investigation.

53
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,151
...until the very end.

54
00:01:58,186 --> 00:01:59,450
Who's he looking to kill?

55
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,636
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

56
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,788
You need to get out of here
right now.

57
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,922
Or time to get out.

58
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,526
It was, like, endless darkness.

59
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,343
STEVE: For our clients
in Manchester, Connecticut,

60
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,977
life was miserable.

61
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:29,365
Their home had become a hotbed
of paranormal activity,

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,717
and the owner, Tom, didn't know
how to protect his family.

63
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,021
And thanks to our investigation,
that guy was about to find out

64
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,791
the only way to tackle
this problem was to man up.

65
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,664
STEVE: Tom, you sounded pretty
stressed out on the phone.

66
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,796
TOM: Yeah.

67
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,200
Our daughter wakes up
in the middle of the night

68
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,367
screaming for us.

69
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,204
As a father,
it's got to be pretty tough.

70
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,408
The look in her face,
just the sheer terror,

71
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,828
it's painful
to watch her struggle.

72
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,439
The level of activity
in the house

73
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,162
had really moved up a notch
at a level

74
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,851
where it was frightening
on a daily basis.

75
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,288
It was almost like the house
was controlling us,

76
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,856
and we wanted to take back
control.

77
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,659
- Now, I understand you're an
ordained minister. - Yes, I am, yeah.

78
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,662
I've done numerous blessings,
and it just doesn't stop.

79
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:20,366
What are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

80
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,486
We've gone as far as we can
on our own,

81
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,571
and we can't live like this
any longer.

82
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:43,756
AMY: As usual,
I had absolutely no information

83
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,524
about the location
before I arrived.

84
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,026
immediately sensed
that the house was overflowing

85
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,530
with dangerous activity,
and just like the living people

86
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,800
that Steve meets,
sometimes the dead I encounter

87
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,601
seem trapped in fear as well.

88
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:01,040
There is this little girl.
She's running from someone.

89
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,340
<i> [ Panting ]</i>

90
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,844
She knows
that if he catches her,

91
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,462
he's gonna hurt her.

92
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,206
I know he gets her.

93
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,916
Is this how she died?

94
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,384
Definitely.

95
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:18,156
STEVE: So, Tom, why'd you
bring me up into this room?

96
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,226
I saw a solid-black mass
moving down the wall.

97
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,793
I was stunned.

98
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,496
TOM: After that, it was
almost like a siege mentality,

99
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,716
where you kind of hunker down
at night

100
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,936
and just hope
that nothing would happen

101
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,770
and wish for the daylight
to come.

102
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,041
At night, I've heard
heavy objects moving.

103
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,843
I come here
and look at the desk,

104
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,310
and nothing had moved.

105
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,649
It's something that I'm not
equipped to deal with.

106
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,621
AMY:
There's a guy down there.

107
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,723
He's saying,

108
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:55,759
"Don't come down here.
Get away from me."

109
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,965
Often, it's not easy
for the dead to understand

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,433
that I'm there to help.

111
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,503
This is wrong.

112
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:10,576
There's a lot of problems here,
specifically in this area.

113
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,310
And it became obvious
in that moment

114
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,548
that the angry man
was agitated by my presence.

115
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,818
Can you talk about
what he does up here

116
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,385
that might
disturb people?

117
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,889
I'm hearing, like,
stuff sliding across the floor.

118
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,257
Like,
hearing furniture moving.

119
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,261
He will really go nuts.

120
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,433
STEVE: Tom's daughter, Allyson,
had several encounters

121
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,969
that would have been damaging
to any kid.

122
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,570
First,
I was afraid of the dark,

123
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:43,142
but then
I was afraid of the ghost.

124
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,277
A ghost.

125
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,377
Like a man?

126
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,410
Yes.

127
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:49,748
He just stands
by the front of my bed.

128
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,618
But it was Tom's wife
who really concerned me

129
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,821
because the thing
that was haunting her the most

130
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,357
were here memories.

131
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,563
Joanna, where are you
actually from?

132
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,698
I'm from Poland.

133
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,331
Okay.

134
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,902
My father worked
with the government,

135
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,238
and he was involved
with police.

136
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:15,041
That's my father.

137
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,910
What did he do
for the government?

138
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,813
He would be the part
of spying on people,

139
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,819
or trying to get rid of
everybody who was in his way.

140
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,621
But my mom was opposite side
of the politics.

141
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,494
And my father, I think he had
anger issue or something,

142
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,363
because I saw him holding gun
against her head.

143
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:44,803
JOANNA:
That was first time I was not
feeling safe around my father.

144
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:49,206
And it's kind of difficult
talking about him,

145
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:53,595
but Steve was very
understanding, very supportive,

146
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,950
and somebody who'd help us
to bring things to normal.

147
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,485
Do you talk to them
at all?

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,951
They divorced
when I was 18,

149
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,123
and after that, I really didn't
keep in touch with him.

150
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,560
I don't even know
if he is alive, to be honest.

151
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:12,230
AMY:
There's this guy.

152
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:18,938
He is some kind of, like,
cop or investigator.

153
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,891
Just a real tough, rough dude.

154
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:24,775
He's constantly on patrol.

155
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,214
And I'm getting that he was
some kind of grandfather figure

156
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,781
or father figure.

157
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,650
Someone
that's here now?

158
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,651
Yes.

159
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,320
He loves them.

160
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,754
Right then,
I realized that dead man

161
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,757
wanted to protect
the residents of the home.

162
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:44,763
But there's, like, times
where he's seeing things

163
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:49,466
that he doesn't agree with
or doesn't like,

164
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,037
and that's when [snaps]
he'll sometimes just snap.

165
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,937
But thanks to his bad temper,

166
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:57,609
I think he was probably doing
more harm than good.

167
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,712
Does he express that
in any way?

168
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,550
He might influence you, like,
to feel angry for no reason.

169
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,986
And then I just see, like,
black and yelling,

170
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,087
which is his temper.

171
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,374
NARRATOR: Next...

172
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,868
This is unheard of.

173
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,498
...secrets are exposed.

174
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,094
I know she was murdered.

175
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,848
NARRATOR: And in our second
investigation...

176
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,601
I'm gonna take my kids
and walk out that door.

177
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,587
...evil is unleashed.

178
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,503
It hurts so **** bad.

179
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,675
You're not welcome here anymore.
You have to go.

180
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,288
STEVE:
From the moment it was built,

181
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,925
Tom and Joanna's house
was plagued with tragedy.

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,528
A couple of years after
the original owner moved in,

183
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,729
he lost his wife
and two infant kids.

184
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,599
But as terrible as that was,
it was no excuse

185
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,105
for what he was accused of doing
after he got remarried.

186
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,716
James and Harriet Lanfear,

187
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,119
they got brought up
on charges of child abuse.

188
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,719
This is 1860.

189
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,757
Were a lot of cases
even brought to trial?

190
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,690
This is unheard of.

191
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,657
It just doesn't happen.

192
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,192
And make it
even more interesting

193
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:25,130
is the people who's bringing
the complaint.

194
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,564
It's his own family.

195
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,801
This is a very well-respected
family in town.

196
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,235
This is a time period

197
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,772
where everybody's
family business

198
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,240
was their own
and no one else's,

199
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,209
so the abuse
had to have been horrendous.

200
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,596
All right, so,
she got a severe whipping

201
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,983
and an application
of a hot flatiron

202
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,752
on one of
the child's limbs.

203
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,085
That's pretty bad.

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,188
So, now, what wound up happening
at the trial?

205
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,624
They were acquitted.

206
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,035
AMY:
I see this, like, black thing.

207
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,303
In life, it was a man.

208
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,541
Now he's, like,
turning into a shadowy thing.

209
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,145
He's like a stalker.

210
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:24,357
MATTHEW: Do you have any idea
about his life?

211
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,424
He goes all over the house,

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,694
so I'm thinking
that he lived here.

213
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,265
AMY: No matter where I went
on the property,

214
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,865
that stalker followed.

215
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,069
At first, I thought he was more
of a nuisance than a threat,

216
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,436
but those feelings changed

217
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,807
as soon as I met
one of his many victims.

218
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,579
Yes.

219
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,449
I see the little girl.
Yes.

220
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,318
She's a living person,

221
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,689
and there's a dead little girl
here as well.

222
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,093
I know she was murdered
by the stalker.

223
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,463
She's here to warn the living
about him.

224
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,265
I think he killed
the dead girl,

225
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:11,603
and I think he wants to kill
this girl.

226
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,377
STEVE: By the late 1800s,
Tom and Joanna's property

227
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,943
had already seen
a lot of misery.

228
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,114
And according to a descendant
of another former owner,

229
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,151
things were only gonna
get worse.

230
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,430
Now, Dennis, what I found
interesting was that...

231
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:42,899
...there was more than death,
as far as tragedy for this family. - Yes.

232
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:47,539
Thomas' oldest son, Thomas,
married his first cousin.

233
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:51,943
So Thomas Sr.
disowned his son.

234
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,443
Wow.

235
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:57,649
But Thomas also had children
that were very devoted to him.

236
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,518
One of them was Edward.

237
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,189
They were very close.
They were both firemen.

238
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,423
He was
the next oldest son,

239
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,695
but he also died
at a very young age of 43.

240
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,435
He suffered over the last
couple years of his life.

241
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,137
Okay.

242
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,747
AMY: This angry guy
in the basement...

243
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,756
he felt very, very ill.

244
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,329
Can you tell anything about
who he was when he was alive?

245
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,797
I think he lived here.

246
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:52,638
He was a pretty private guy,
got sick in his 40s.

247
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,977
I'm always trying to understand
the motivation

248
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,710
behind a dead person's behavior.

249
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,964
One way I do this
is by experiencing

250
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,924
in a physical way
their emotions.

251
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,815
And using this technique
on that man,

252
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,154
I quickly identified the source
of his anger issues.

253
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,621
And it hurt.

254
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,591
And it hurts, like, here
really bad.

255
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:19,932
His life was met
with darkness and tragedy.

256
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,734
Oh, this is bad.

257
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:26,870
NARRATOR: Coming up...

258
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,440
His intentions are to kill.

259
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,177
...what happened
after the investigation?

260
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,880
TOM:
In the name of Jesus Christ,

261
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,548
I command you
to leave this place.

262
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:01,823
STEVE: Amy, I'd like you to meet
Tom and Joanna.

263
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:05,936
When I first met Amy,
I had a lot of trepidation.

264
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,015
And I just kind of buckled down
and braced myself

265
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,949
for what I was gonna hear.

266
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,888
Their biggest concern is their
8- year-old daughter, Allyson.

267
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,690
AMY:
When I walked in the basement

268
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,176
and I saw this entity,

269
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,628
he was very angry,

270
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,364
and I kept feeling pain
in my stomach, and

271
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,336
it felt like it took a long time
before he died.

272
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,672
Any idea how old
this guy might have been?

273
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,572
45.

274
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:36,707
Wow. Okay.

275
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,176
One guy to actually live

276
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,343
on this property here
was Edward Coleman.

277
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:44,749
He died in his early 40s
from kidney and heart failure.

278
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,119
One of the symptoms
of kidney failure

279
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,420
is a swelling of the stomach
and cramps.

280
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:55,127
What this person likes to do
is just be left alone.

281
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:58,597
When he's not left alone,
he'll get upset,

282
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,730
and you can feel that.

283
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:04,219
TOM: That kind of really
caught me off guard

284
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:07,673
because I had no idea
that Edward's feelings

285
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,275
could influence us
here in the house.

286
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,976
I wanted him to leave.

287
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,814
STEVE:
What else did you see?

288
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,248
I met this other man.

289
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,286
He was, like, a tough guy,
like a cop,

290
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,921
and he had a short temper.

291
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,388
I felt like he was a father,

292
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,626
a grandfather
to somebody who lives here.

293
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,531
JOANNA: I don't know
if he's alive or not,

294
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,434
but my father was a cop,
and he had a temper,

295
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,770
and one time,
he would take gun

296
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,439
and put to my mom's head.

297
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,843
JOANNA: I didn't want to believe
that it could be my father,

298
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,278
but he fits that description,

299
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,514
and I start feeling worried
about him

300
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,252
affecting the family and energy
in this house.

301
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,624
So, he's not the kind
of guy that we'd want
to see around here.

302
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,561
Trying to protect.

303
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,031
I was a little conflicted
in that

304
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,403
the father/grandfather figure
could have been Joanna's father.

305
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,323
He wasn't a good person,
but it was reassuring

306
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,209
that there was
a close family member, perhaps,

307
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:21,230
being here, watching over us.

308
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,926
I saw an entity
I was afraid of.

309
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:28,509
I felt that this entity
hates women.

310
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:32,057
When he was alive,
he did harm them.

311
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,894
STEVE: Let me tell you
about this guy, James Lanfear.

312
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,730
He lived on the property here.

313
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,496
He and his wife went on trial

314
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,035
for severely beating
their 10-year-old daughter.

315
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,505
I was watching through the eyes
of a little girl

316
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,208
that he was stalking
and then murdered.

317
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,643
He was so filled
with negativity

318
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,116
that he is turning into
kind of like a dark mass.

319
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,689
I did do a sketch of something
that I saw upstairs.

320
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,391
And then there's
a little girl here.

321
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,257
She's wearing
a little dress,

322
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:13,431
and there's, like, this weird
black thing behind her.

323
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,313
That's their daughter.

324
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,417
This is the little girl
that he murdered.

325
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:38,022
TOM: When I saw the sketch
of Allyson's bedroom,

326
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,023
I had a pit in my stomach.

327
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,292
As a father,
it just disturbs you

328
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,029
to think that
I can't protect my daughter

329
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,429
while she's sleeping.

330
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:50,267
So, why would he come to me
and my daughter?

331
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,673
His victims are coming to her
to try to warn her and you.

332
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,193
His intentions are to kill.

333
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:59,678
Who's he looking to kill?

334
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,246
Your daughter.

335
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,014
It does make me feel mad.

336
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:08,253
I wanted to say to this entity,
"Get the hell out of here."

337
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,256
And I was anxious to know
if Amy can see the way

338
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,856
to save my family.

339
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,326
STEVE: Well, I realize
this was a tough night,

340
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,064
but we still haven't answered
your most pressing question.

341
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,331
Is it safe for Allyson
to grow up here?

342
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,668
One of the things
that I would like to see happen

343
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:31,610
is for you to have an exorcist
perform a ritual to remove him.

344
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,378
Once that's done,

345
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,999
it's very likely
that all of the victims

346
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,550
will leave,
because their job is done.

347
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,186
- So, will that exorcism
get rid of the fireman? - No.

348

So, for him, perform
the real basic cleansing.

What about Joanna's dad?

350
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,428
One thing
that I would ask you to do

351
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,532
is to write a letter
to your father about everything.

352
00:18:55,567 --> 00:19:00,605
And then at the end, tell him
to now leave you alone in peace.

353

through the whole thing,
you know?

355
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,678
As a man of this home
and this family,

356
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,144
you have to buck up.

357
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,147
You got to be strong
for your daughter.

358
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:15,154
You need to help her
and your wife get through this.

Shortly after the investigation,

360
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,391
we did have a flurry of activity
in the house,

361
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,111
and I was ready to do
whatever was necessary

362

Our Father who art in Heaven,

00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,916
hallowed be Thy name.

365
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,355
I blessed the house myself,
went through with a thurible

366
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,056
and said "The Lord's Prayer"...

367

Forgive us our sins

who sin against us.

369
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,330

to leave.

I command you
to leave this place.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord,

the light of my conscience

TOM: While the priest
was preparing for the exorcism,

377
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,252
he started by drawing
the convocation circle

378
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,722
to draw the spirits
to the basement

379
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,122
and protect him
during the ceremony.

380
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,259
I've never seen anything
of that nature before.

381

Oh, ye spirits, ye, I conjure

382
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,165
by the power, wisdom, and virtue
of the spirit of God.

His voice got more intense
and louder.

384
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,336
And I exorcise thee
by the most holy name

385
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,804
of Eloah Va-Daath!

386
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,775

It was kind of
a building process.

And by all these names,
be delivered from this place.

It was very abrupt

the atmosphere of the house

JOANNA: As for my father,
I didn't write the letter

404
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,295
because I spoke with my mom,

my father did not pass away.

Thinking into my past,

my grandfather

the fate of her father,

00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,932
it seems that the final chapter
of that relationship

But what Amy and I uncovered

422
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,624
was that her real problem
wasn't caused by any ghosts.

00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,424
AMY:
This is not good.

522
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:48,600
There was, like, a man
crawling out from under here.

523
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,040
Just, like, a black,
slithery, snaky thing.

524
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,778
Ever since coming to terms
with my abilities,

525
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,880
I've learned to expect
the unexpected.

526
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,414
But, really, I wasn't prepared

527
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,651
for what I was seeing
at that moment.

528
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,423
He makes you feel fear.

529
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,726
And watching him squirm around
on the ground,

530
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,130
I wasn't sure if he was in pain
or planning an attack.

531
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,665
Then you feel like
you're gonna throw up,

532
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,537
like, 'cause it's so --
Your stomach feels scared.

533
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,577
STEVE: It's always tricky
when kids are involved,

534
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:34,510
but since Emily and Erich
were concerned

535
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,748
the activity was affecting
their younger children,

536
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,816
I knew that the best thing
for me to do

537
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,383
was hear
their side of the story.

538
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,856
Okay, so, Erich, why don't you
tell me what you've been seeing?

539
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,993
Sometimes I see a shadow
in the hallway, like, a man.

540
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,895
What about you, sweetie?

541
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,128
When I go to bed,

542
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:56,000
I always see a man
go down the hallway.

543
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,435
Is it the same
like he sees it?

544
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,470
- Does that scare you?
- Mm-hmm.

545
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:04,708
Do you have trouble going to bed
at night because of that?

546
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,577
Sometimes.

547
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:06,411
Me too.

548
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:15,253
People are hiding
under blankets and sheets.

549
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:22,360
I'd say at least three of them
have some PK **** going on.

550
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,593
Okay.

551
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,797
I think it's really
just mainly a poltergeist.

552
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,866
NARRATOR: Next...

553
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:29,900
So, how bad was it?

554
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,900
All the babies died.

555
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,069
...tragedy hits home.

556
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,707
It was awful.
It took so many of them.

557
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,221
STEVE: I began my research
into Emily and Erich's home

558
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,190
at the most logical
starting point --

559
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,389
the previous homeowner.

560
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,493
This route
doesn't always pan out,

561
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:57,227
but this time, it paid off.

562
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,864
And not only did
our conversation help my case,

563
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,733
I think it helped her, too.

564
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,341
Shannon, now,
you mentioned on the phone

565
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,828
that you had some information
that could help my case.

566
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:16,314
Well, my grandfather passed away
here in the house

567
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,614
of natural causes.

568
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,783
Did anybody else die
in the house that you know of?

569
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:21,984
Ah, yes.

570
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,387
My other grandfather's
girlfriend.

571
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,891
There was a coatrack
next to the stairway

572
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,358
to the basement,

573
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:32,863
and Georgina
went towards the coatrack

574
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,130
and fell down
the stairs.

575
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,699
How'd your grandfather
take that?

576
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,803
It's the first time
I ever seen him cry.

577
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,776
I haven't thought about it
in years.

578
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,614
AMY:
Somebody died back here.

579
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,866
What happened?

580
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,178
It was very fast.

581
00:30:55,213 --> 00:30:57,420
A lot of fear.

582
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,522
And it's like a sudden --
Man, it's like, "Bam!"

583
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:04,795
As I was trying to get a handle
on the activity outside,

584
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,429
I felt driven to go inside

585
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,332
and face that PK manifestation
one last time.

586
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,967
In hindsight, I wish I hadn't.

587
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:14,772
I'm, like, very confused
right now.

588
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,758
Like, like --
[ Sighs ]

589
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,401
Here's the pain again.

590
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:20,010
Like, the grabbing?

591
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,043
Yes.

592
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:24,581
It hurts so **** bad.

593
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,549
STEVE:
Combing through the archives,

594
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,420
I found that one of the original
landowners, Noah Furton,

595
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:32,356
was met with one misfortune
after another.

596
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,789
But from the sound of things,

597
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:36,193
Noah's cousin Adolphus
had it even worse.

598
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,394
And that's when I realized

599
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,766
that the property
was prone to tragedy.

600
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,342
Adolphus comes from a long line
of French Canadians

601
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,975
who settled
in this area.

602
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,480
Okay, and then, they settled
here to do what kind of work?

603
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,899
He went to the occupation
of sailing.

604
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:01,284
I know that's dangerous work
today,

605
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,421
so how bad was that for them
back then?

606
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:11,429
AMY: This black, like, slithery,
snaky thing.

607
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,135
I'm trying to figure out what he
looked like when he was alive.

608
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,769
He's a big guy.

609
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,374
Has an accent
and/or spoke another language.

610
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,709
I think he's scared,

611
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:30,781
and there's a lot of violence
around him and in his life.

612
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,783
Was Adolphus married?

613
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,149
Yes, he was.

614
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,487
His wife, Mary,
was married to him

615
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,821
the 29th of January
of 1886,

616
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,456
and they had seven children
together. - Okay.

617
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:43,828
Now, you mentioned he had an
unthinkable tragedy in his life.

618
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:45,096
What was it?

619
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:52,370
AMY: I saw a graveyard...

620
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,042
that was built for children.

621
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,478
All of the children
died as infants,

622
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,145
except for his daughter
Julia.

623
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,982
She died as a teenager
from consumption

624
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,785
at the age of 17,
but all the babies died.

625
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,852
Wow.

626
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,589
So, he buried
all of his kids.

627
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,024
AMY:
I hear a voice say,

628
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,995
"It was awful.
It took so many of them."

629
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,898
Now, with all this tragedy
in his life,

630
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,800
what wound up happening
with Adolphus?

631
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:27,370
The men here have problems.

632
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:32,893
Yeah. Dead and living men
have problems in this location.

633
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,382
Adolphus, on November 21, 1916,
drowned in Lake St. Clair.

634
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,919
He was lost on the ice,
and his body was not found

635
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,886
until
the following spring.

636
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,623
Okay.
And they ruled it accidental?

637
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,389
Yes.

638
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:50,359
Some normal guy moves in,

639
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:55,233
and then he gets involved
with bad ****

640
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,566
or drops dead or goes crazy.

641
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:01,239
But it doesn't have anything
to do with the PK phenomena.

642
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:03,841
Is this anything
that might be dangerous?

643
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,342
Yeah.

644
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,410
NARRATOR: Next...

645
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,214
You seem pretty upset
by what she's saying.

646
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,815
...the shocking truth
is revealed.

647
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,048
It's like a curse.

648
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,117
But can this frightened
family...

649
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,321
EMILY: We just wanted
to make things right.

650
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,091
NARRATOR:
...face their demons.

651
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:20,709
Only love...

652
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:21,718
...light...

653
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:22,222
...and peace...

654
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:22,692
...may enter.

655
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,079
STEVE:
This is Erich and Emily.

656
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:49,053
EMILY:
When we started the reveal,
my stomach was in knots.

657
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:51,286
I was just so anxious to hear

658
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:55,058
why the activity
was happening to my family.

659
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,591
STEVE: Things have gotten
very physical,

660
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,796
and it looks like it's directed
more towards Emily.

661
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,966
I did see the graveyard
that was built for children.

662
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,569
And this property
is not good for men.

663
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,073
It's interesting
you say that it's bad for men

664
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,976
because an original owner of
your property was Noah Furton.

665
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,944
And he had lost two sons.

666
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,649
He had a cousin named Adolphus
that lived with him.

667
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,317
All of Adolphus' seven kids
died young.

668
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,754
Not only that, he ends up
drowning in Lake St. Clair.

669
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,987
Wow.

670
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,458
It's like a curse.

671
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:33,630
EMILY: I was scared
for my husband and my two sons.

672
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,900
I don't want something
I can't see

673
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,934
ripping my family apart,

674
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:43,107
possibly even taking one
of my family members from me.

675
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:47,528
The next thing
that I encountered

676
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:51,141
was a dead person
underneath the car.

677
00:35:51,176 --> 00:35:54,684
And the way he moved
was snakelike.

678
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,556
I did do a sketch
of the man that I saw.

679
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:02,625
He doesn't have,
like, any legs.

680
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,631
He still has,
like, his head and torso.

681
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,837
And he's wrapped
in a black mist.

682
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,238
Whoa.

683
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,975
Mm.

684
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:24,715
Is there any chance
that this guy here

685
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,050
could be one of the Furtons?

686
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:27,416
Very possible.

687
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,252
ERICH: When I first looked
at the sketch,

688
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:33,691
I came very close
to breaking down at that point.

689
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,993
I didn't know exactly
what that entity was,

690
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,097
but I wanted to somehow
make it go away.

691
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,532
So, what I finally figured

692
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:47,338
is that there's three
main experiences

693
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:50,892
that you guys
would encounter.

694
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:54,376
The first thing
is physical abuse.

695
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:58,482
And this seemed to be directed
towards women.

696
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:02,086
Tell her what happens
when you take a shower.

697
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:04,555
It's like a burn.

698
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,558
Whoa. Okay.

699
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,926
Wow!

700
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,795
The second experience
was the voices.

701
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:19,069
When I got into the kids' room,
it was crazy out of control.

702
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,305
We all hear it every day.

703
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:25,643
The third thing,
my heart hurt.

704
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,415
I had a heart attack last year
for no reason.

705
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,182
What happened?

706
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,685
The doctors
can't explain it.

707
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,225
EMILY:
I never mentioned it to Steve
because I really didn't think

708
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,825
me having a heart attack
was relevant,

709
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,998
but how can you not think that
it's being caused by this house

710
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:51,719
when you hear information
like that?

711
00:37:51,754 --> 00:37:55,406
So, there was another sketch
that I did.

712
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,445
We both see them.

713
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,252
It has developed into
a full-blown poltergeist.

714
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:14,024
So, these strings of light
that we see,

715
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,160
that's a poltergeist.

716
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,766
You both
seem to have abilities,

717
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,419
and then all of this energy
builds.

718
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:28,038
Then we can feed
off of the dead.

719
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,006
So, with this guy here,

720
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:36,380
he's being absorbed
by your poltergeist.

721
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,952
When Amy told me that
we were creating a poltergeist,

722
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,418
it blew me away.

723
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:47,124
I actually felt really bad
for the slithering man.

724
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,526
He's suffering still,
and it's our fault.

725
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,429
STEVE: But the main question is,
"Can you live here safely?

726
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:55,064
And can you fix
what's going on?"

727
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,434
We need to get the dead
out of the house.

728
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,770
So, to start off,
you're going to be doing

729
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,957
home cleansings
three times a week.

730
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:06,109
Also, to eliminate
this poltergeist,

731
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,347
I would suggest tai chi
as a family, together.

732
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:12,850
So, what's gonna happen
to this guy?

733
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:16,319
Once the poltergeist
is dissipating,

734
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,353
it's going to release him.

735
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:21,292
What can they do about
this thing that's bad for men?

736
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:26,462
I would suggest
bringing in a shaman

737
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,316
to do a cleansing ceremony
on the land.

738
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:32,169
So, are you gonna listen
to our advice?

739
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,953
EMILY:
After the investigation,

740
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:56,026
the poltergeist activity
really ramped up.

741
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,762
We just wanted
to make things right,

742
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:04,067
so that's why we took the steps
to get rid of this

743
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,436
as quick as we can.

744
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:12,475
First, we cleansed
all the walls in the house

745
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,946
with the warm saltwater
and said the chant.

746
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:16,664
Only love...

747
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:17,807
...light...

748
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:18,378
...and peace...

749
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:19,698
...may enter.

750
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:20,358
All the dead...

751
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:20,949
...must leave.

752
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,651
ERICH: We wrote the saying

753
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,456
on a chalkboard
that is in our kitchen.

754
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,362
SHAMAN:
Nothing negative may remain,

755
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,165
and any spirits
that are on this property

756
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,700
may you be released.

757
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,188
The shaman was outside
doing her cleansing

758
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:44,150
to release the children
that were stuck here.

759
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:47,077
If there are any children
on these grounds,

760
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,510
may they be, please, returned

761
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,414
to their families
and loved ones.

762
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:54,316
But then the wind picked up.

763
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:58,121
The black clouds rolled in,
and the thunder started.

764
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,892
SHAMAN: I call on the ancestors
and spirits above.

765
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,625
May you charge and bless
this home

766
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:06,846
with positive energy,
absorbing all the negativity.

767
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,067
EMILY: She could sense
something evil in the house,

768
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:11,833
and she was gonna get rid of it.

769
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:15,971
You're not welcome here anymore.
You have to go.

770
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,439
She started to sweat.

771
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,343
It was like something
was trying to fight her.

772
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,814
May love and light
enter this home.

773
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:26,282
Nothing negative can remain.

774
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,818
Her final step
was a shamanic extraction

775
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:34,692
in order to lessen our abilities
to create a poltergeist.

776
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:37,526
You're just gonna feel
a slight tug,

777
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,497
and I'm pulling
the negative energy out of you.

778
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,030
ERICH:
It was a wild experience.

779
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:45,202
SHAMAN:
You're no longer welcome here.

780
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:48,339
Anything negative or evil,
be gone.

781
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,613
EMILY: After the blessing,
I felt revived,

782
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:59,033
and I truly felt no negativities
in the house.

783
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:02,612
ERICH: We have started tai chi
as a family

784
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:06,156
to help focus on controlling
our energies

785
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,657
so this doesn't happen again.

786
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,362
EMILY: I feel like
my family can just move forward.

787
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,097
It's like weight
off of my shoulders.

788
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,234
AMY: I'm happy to hear
that Emily's family

789
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,136
is finding their balance,

790
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,640
but having that many people
with abilities under one roof

791
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,106
won't be easy.

792
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,144
And that means staying safe
could be an everyday challenge.
