1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,384
That's not good.

2
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:14,853
Something's attacking her.

3
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,056
Everybody's hearing voices.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,491
Some living people have disappeared.

5
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,361
This is the victim that he murdered.

6
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:23,996
I'm real sick in this room.

7
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,332
It's, like, trying to bite
my chest and my throat.

8
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,134
It definitely creeped me out.

9
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:32,237
The dead can go into the house.

10
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:37,042
I think that some of
them could be dangerous.

11
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:39,845
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:42,948
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,616
What's happening?

14
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:46,986
I see dead people.

15
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:48,687
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,289
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,224
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,392
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:55,527
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,530
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,499
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,101
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,369
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:05,371
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:07,473
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,676
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,910
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,345
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,614
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,349
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,385
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:20,586
...until the very end.

33
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:22,354
You got problems. I got news for you.

34
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,556
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,625
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,277
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,963
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:49,148
I'm in Roseburg, Oregon.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,350
It's about an hour south of Eugene.

40
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:54,119
I received a call from a woman named Lori.

41
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,356
Now, she takes care of
elderly people in her home.

42
00:01:57,358 --> 00:02:00,793
She says the activity is
putting her patients at risk

43
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,095
and destroying her personal life.

44
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,965
She sounded really bad,
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

45
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:14,773
Before Amy arrives,

46
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:17,476
I sweep the house, removing artwork,

47
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:20,479
family photos, and personal items

48
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:22,681
to avoid influencing her findings.

49
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:23,916
When I'm finished,

50
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:26,051
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,734
Oh, boy. That's not good.

52
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,137
You know, there's a doorway there.

53
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:55,881
It's pretty long,
and it does kind of go pretty far that way.

54
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:05,157
There are things,

55
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,462
and there's also some kind of path.

56
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,934
Now, this is separate from this doorway.

57
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:22,074
There are dead people on it, walking.

58
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,345
I'm very concerned about the living people

59
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:29,114
wandering up in there and disappearing.

60
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:31,383
Like, where are they disappearing to?

61
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,686
Other dimensions.

62
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:43,562
Lori, I'm glad I'm here.

63
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,814
You sounded really upset
and desperate on the phone.

64
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:47,199
So, what's exactly going on?

65
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,234
It's really been tough here.

66
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,103
Um, in the last three years,

67
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,372
things have just gotten to the point

68
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:55,841
to where I'm scared to be here.

69
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,609
Now, who exactly lives in the house?

70
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,063
Me, my boyfriend, Devin,
his little girl, Cameron.

71
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:04,049
I have a picture of her here.
This is Cameron.

72
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:08,554
And I have an adult foster care that we run,

73
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:11,990
and so there's three ladies
that live also in the home.

74
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,325
So, they're here all the time?

75
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,359
All the time.

76
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,460
So, these people are, basically,

77
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,862
part of your family when you think about it?

78
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:17,880
Yes. They are.

79
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,866
I also have a caregiver who lives here

80
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:22,501
by the name of Julie.

81
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,819
Are they experiencing anything?

82
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:27,472
Yes, they're afraid to
even go to bed at night.

83
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,174
Everybody's hearing voices,

84
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:33,345
items moving on their own, apparitions.

85
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,597
Our health is declining here,

86
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,549
and our mood swings are elevated.

87
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:42,120
Now, how long have you been living here?

88
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:43,238
I grew up here.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,842
I moved away when I turned 18,

90
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:50,846
and I moved back here about seven,
eight years now.

91
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,764
You know any history about the house?

92
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,766
Not really, I just know that the house

93
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,637
was originally about a mile north from here.

94
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,038
And here's a picture of the house

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,608
when it was first moved here.

96
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,011
So, the house has been moved? Yeah.

97
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,679
Do you have any idea why it was moved?

98
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:08,997
They had to move the house

99
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,116
to make way for the interstate freeway.

100
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:12,451
Okay. Now, do you know

101
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,670
if this is still on the original property?

102
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,054
Yeah, it is.

103
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,990
Okay, that's interesting.

104
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,826
Have you done anything in the house

105
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,628
to try to fix what's happening here?

106
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,415
I tried to sage it a couple times,
doing a blessing.

107
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,466
Okay.

108
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,534
And that didn't really work.

109
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,303
What do you hope we can do for you?

110
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,705
The home, it means a lot to me.

111
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,275
I pray and I hope that you and Amy

112
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:39,378
can help us with what's going on here

113
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,847
so we can continue our business
and continue living here.

114
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:48,153
There's a barrier.

115
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:54,126
Someone's put up, uh,
protections around the property,

116
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:58,930
but, uh, things are getting in.

117
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:02,301
Because of the pathway and
the doorway in the woods,

118
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,569
the activity here is out of control.

119
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,705
Dead people and strange creatures

120
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,340
are walking in and out of this home.

121
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:11,877
So, I do think that they've
heard scratching on the walls,

122
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,980
people walking around.

123
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:17,349
Yeah, they've seen some weird [bleep]

124
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,923
Okay. What's going on in here?

125
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,625
This is where the business

126
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,593
and my resident and my caregiver live.

127
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,246
Okay. And this was here when
you lived here as a kid?

128
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:33,332
Yes, my bedroom's right
over here when I grew up.

129
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,599
Let me ask you a question.

130
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,469
Back then, were you having any experiences?

131
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:38,804
We had a few experiences.

132
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:44,009
My grandmother would see faces
or people looking in at her

133
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,011
through the windows and her door.

134
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,846
Just faces, though. Not a body.

135
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:51,316
How was her mind at the time?

136
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:52,551
She was fine.

137
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,119
All right. What else is going on down here?

138
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,854
Well, down here we hear,

139
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:58,990
like, footsteps upstairs when nobody's home,

140
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:00,976
voices, like, people talking,

141
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,962
conversations of people that aren't there.

142
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,198
Between how many people, you think?

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,783
- Two, three.
- All right.

144
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,601
I mean, TVs left on upstairs,
anything like that?

145
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:14,523
No, and we have banging
sounds throughout the house.

146
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:18,377
And it sounds like someone's picking up,
like, encyclopedias

147
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,313
and just dropping 'em, books just booms.

148
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,014
It's really crazy.

149
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:24,816
I mean, that's got to scare
the hell out of you.

150
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,017
Yeah, it does.

151
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:32,257
I'm seeing a creature thing, big and dark.

152
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:38,597
Looks like an animal,
scratching on the outside walls.

153
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,300
It's not very intelligent.

154
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,637
Uh... it's more like a moth.

155
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,322
Do you know where it comes from?

156
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,508
From that, uh, hallway.

157
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,327
Are the other things that
come out of this hallway,

158
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,612
are they like this one?

159
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:57,249
Uh, they're all different entities.

160
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,819
I think that some of
them could be dangerous.

161
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,492
What's going on in here?

162
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,795
It's almost like a struggle every day

163
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,263
just to be yourself here.

164
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,899
I think all of us happen
to have mood swings.

165
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,535
Devin and I,
we're having a really tough time.

166
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,271
It's just this rage that gets into you.

167
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:21,923
The easiest and simplest little thing

168
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,726
just flares him off or flares me off.

169
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,479
Now, these mood swings,
is it affecting your relationship?

170
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,115
Yes, our relationship's about done.

171
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:34,686
If we can't figure this out,
I think we're splitting up.

172
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,388
- Really?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,191
I mean, couples go through
that all the time.

174
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,826
- You sure it's paranormal?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:43,261
Since the activity has picked up,

176
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,397
we're not the same people.

177
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,631
Do you feel any better when you're away?

178
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,800
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

179
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:51,102
We don't fight, we don't argue,

180
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,638
we don't go into these weird rages.

181
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,423
Now, is anything else going on?

182
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,042
We're all getting very ill.

183
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:59,344
I'm just fatigued in this home,

184
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:04,416
and I've been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,
lots of pain.

185
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,685
When you leave here, do you feel any better?

186
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,087
Yeah, I have a lot more energy.

187
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,556
I'm begging you guys to help me.

188
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,707
All right.

189
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,959
Hopefully you called us in,
in time, you know,

190
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,160
and we can get this fixed.

191
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,795
I hope so.

192
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,972
I'm seeing a living woman in here.

193
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,476
I think they are a sensitive.

194
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,911
I think they know it.

195
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:36,414
I think it's something
that is in their family.

196
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:47,125
If there's random dead
people that run through,

197
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:51,997
a person could pick up on that
and the feelings from that.

198
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,266
Being a sensitive in a highly active area

199
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,535
over time can make you sick.

200
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:57,836
Sick how?

201
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:00,839
Anything from flu-like symptoms to cancer.

202
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:28,423
So, Devin, I was talking to Lori

203
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,557
and she says you live here with her.

204
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,592
Yes, correct.

205
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:33,161
She also explained how both of you

206
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,597
have mood swings that are
causing a lot of tension.

207
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,731
We can just be getting along just fine,

208
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:37,932
and all of a sudden,

209
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,667
just be angry with each other for no reason.

210
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,402
But what makes you think it's paranormal,
though?

211
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:42,320
I mean, couples fight.

212
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,272
Because of the way it escalates,

213
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:45,607
and the feelings that I get.

214
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:48,126
You know, it has a lot to do with the house.

215
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,745
I've sat down and had
conversations with Lori

216
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,747
about maybe it's the entity here.

217
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,950
I can feel the vibes coming off of it.

218
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,886
It's definitely gonna
get enjoyment out of...

219
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:00,688
of wrecking a relationship.

220
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,257
Have you had any experiences here?

221
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,994
Uh, just the cupboards being opened.

222
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,395
Lots of cupboards.

223
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,130
I'm thinking, you know,

224
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,166
Lori leaving the cupboards
again and it's not.

225
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:14,986
And do they lock in, or are they loose?

226
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,337
They do catch.

227
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,039
Do you hear it,
or you just go in there and you see it?

228
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,674
Just go in and see it.

229
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,876
Just after I just closed 'em.

230
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:25,146
- Anything else?
- Yes.

231
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:26,848
My daughter, she got pushed.

232
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,416
- She got pushed.
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:31,185
She was outside on the steps,
out there by the fish pond

234
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,388
- before the fish pond was put in.
- Okay.

235
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,257
And I was sitting inside the house,
and she ran in,

236
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,992
just screaming in hysterics.

237
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:39,577
And she's sure it wasn't one of the animals

238
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,429
- bumping into her or anything like that?
- No, no.

239
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,564
I know she's very well
stressed out about it.

240
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,466
She's very scared.

241
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:48,569
It's not fair. It's not fair to anybody.

242
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:57,078
There's someone with long brown hair.

243
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,513
I think it's a girl.

244
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,948
Something's happening to her.

245
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,785
Something's, like, attacking her.

246
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,005
Her arms, she can't lift them

247
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,057
because they are being held down.

248
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,933
I don't know what that was.

249
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,276
There was this weird
person that ran out of here

250
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:32,980
and then jumped out at me, growled,

251
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,850
and was, like,
trying to bite my chest and my throat.

252
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,654
They just ran... ran away,
and it was, like, out of nowhere.

253
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,890
It definitely creeped me out, though.

254
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,697
I've seen an apparition.

255
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,299
- Of what?
- Of a lady.

256
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:52,934
What kind of clothing we talking about?

257
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:56,370
Talking about the old... old school,
like 18th century.

258
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,039
You know, those old shirts
that used to balloon out?

259
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,474
- Puff... puff out, yeah.
- Puff out.

260
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,459
- That's what she was wearing.
- Okay.

261
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,928
Now, if you had to guess
on an age of this person,

262
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,012
what would you think?

263
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:08,282
Probably 30s, 40s, something like that.

264
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:10,017
Okay. So, not... not a young teenage girl.

265
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,452
Were you drinking the night before?

266
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,336
- Where you woke up a little hammered?
- No, no.

267
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,755
- Nothing like that?
- No.

268
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:16,691
Definitely more than one
entity that comes through here,

269
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:17,959
and it just seems like

270
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,495
spirits are trying to get to the other side,

271
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:22,313
and this is a go-through.

272
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:23,981
Okay.

273
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:35,510
I think most of the activity
is coming from outside.

274
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:40,381
It's very unsettled.

275
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:43,151
There's a lot of traffic.

276
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,954
Dead traffic.

277
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:50,258
The house isn't in a good place.

278
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,349
The first hallway is here,

279
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:02,336
and mostly what I'm seeing
coming out of this end

280
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:05,840
are more creature-like things.

281
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:08,976
Things I don't know what they are.

282
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,613
Next to it is a path

283
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:16,450
that a lot of the dead people are on.

284
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:21,088
Sometimes,
the ones that are consciously dead

285
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:27,695
will... will wander off the
path and can go into the house.

286
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:38,372
Julie, I was talking to Lori

287
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,308
and she says you work and live here.

288
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,342
Correct.

289
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,643
Okay. How long has that been going on?

290
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,295
I've worked here a little over two years

291
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:45,746
and lived here about eight months.

292
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,448
Now, you've had experiences here?

293
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,583
Yes, I have.

294
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:51,319
The first one being a human bite mark

295
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,787
right here on my arm.

296
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,889
I woke up with it.

297
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,207
Okay. Was it, like, red?

298
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,558
Oh, yeah.

299
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,495
Just like little,
tiny... like a human bite mark.

300
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:02,864
Why did I get a bite mark?

301
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,599
You know, I don't... I don't know.

302
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,467
Why me?

303
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,237
I can see it upsets you,
just thinking about it.

304
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,472
It does.

305
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,958
You know, I'm not gonna leave, though.

306
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,943
I mean, I'm just... I won't.

307
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,545
Well, you take care of these people

308
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,713
like you're family to them.

309
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:22,450
They are my family.

310
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,986
Now, let me ask you a question, Julie.

311
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:27,455
Is there any place in the
house or anywhere at all

312
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:28,606
that you don't like at all?

313
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,691
Yes, the wooded area outside.

314
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,460
On two different occasions,

315
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:35,796
I've seen a light flicker
and it was black outside.

316
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:37,048
Totally dark, no lights.

317
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,816
I can imagine it gets dark here.

318
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,034
It does get very dark,

319
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:44,171
and this was very clear that it was a light.

320
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:45,990
I don't have a reason for it.

321
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,144
It's like someone stood out
there and lit a lighter.

322
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:53,414
It scares me, and I come in, you know?

323
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,783
But you did check the first time you saw it?

324
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,852
I did, and the next morning I went out

325
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,553
and looked to see if possibly

326
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:01,589
there was a cigarette butt, you know?

327
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,590
- Right.
- There was nothing.

328
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:15,336
There's this path next
to this hallway thing.

329
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:18,773
It goes this way, too, pretty far.

330
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:25,513
Also, I think that, you know,
sometimes, over the years,

331
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:30,318
some living people have gone
into this and have disappeared.

332
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,386
Somebody could just walk

333
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,755
into this hallway thing and disappear?

334
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,791
I do think so, yes.

335
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:37,858
So, where does it go?

336
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,994
I'd say other dimensions.

337
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,279
Where do those go?

338
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,280
I... I don't know.

339
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,764
I don't want to know.

340
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,609
I went through the property deeds

341
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,327
and nothing really jumped out at me,

342
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,445
but when I got in touch

343
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,247
with a local historian and author,

344
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,115
she said the story of the first owner

345
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,034
of Lori's property might help my case.

346
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,425
Well, Diane,
thanks for taking the time to meet me.

347
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:18,760
I appreciate that.

348
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,679
So, who exactly was the
first owner of the property

349
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:21,897
I'm investigating?

350
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,767
Rufus Beamon was the first
owner of the property.

351
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,136
This is a picture of him.

352
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,644
This is the documents showing his ownership

353
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:38,763
of 320 acres in... in the area of Roseburg.

354
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,183
Gosh, that's a lot of property.

355
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,350
That was standard.

356
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,387
And if you were married, you got 640 acres.

357
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:46,488
Wow.

358
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:56,164
Uh, there's somebody on the floor.

359
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,335
Why is this person on the floor?

360
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,721
It's like something
paranormal happened to him,

361
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,406
and he fell down because of it.

362
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,886
So, that's where he went.

363
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,591
He just wants to show me things
that happened to him here.

364
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:27,495
He was haunted here.

365
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:34,302
What I saw so far was him being
in a chair and freaking out.

366
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:36,905
I don't know if he built this place

367
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,407
or if he's the first owner of it,

368
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,311
but he feels like that to me.

369
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:49,251
Now, Diane,
you mentioned that this guy, Beamon,

370
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,219
had an interesting story that may help
my case. What did you mean by that?

371
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,456
He participated in the
Rogue River Indian Wars.

372
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,523
What happened?

373
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,792
Settlers wanted the land,

374
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:00,762
and the Native Americans, of course,

375
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,115
were being shoved off their
land and kind of fought back.

376
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,233
Okay.

377
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,902
The battle he was involved in,

378
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,138
called the Battle of Hungry Hill,

379
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,875
took place on October 31, 1855.

380
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,644
Where exactly was this battle set?

381
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,112
Just out of Roseburg.

382
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,680
Okay.

383
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:20,799
A group of the Native Americans

384
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,784
had gone into the hills to hide.

385
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,388
One of the Native Americans situated himself

386
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,356
so that he was a sniper,

387
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:32,594
and he started shooting the men
that were coming up the hill.

388
00:19:32,596 --> 00:19:34,796
So now, how bloody did this battle get?

389
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,782
And the settlers and the militia

390
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:39,484
lost about 39 men.

391
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:42,604
The Native Americans probably
had 15 to 16 casualties.

392
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:46,424
This is the only battle that
the Native Americans won.

393
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:49,644
So now, did Beamon come out of this okay?

394
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,679
Yes, he did.

395
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,581
He returned home to his property,

396
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,418
and he lived on the land
for a few more years

397
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,702
before he sold it,

398
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,722
and then he moved up to Washington in 1861.

399
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:02,557
So, what happens to the Native Americans?

400
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,195
In April of 1856, they were all rounded up

401
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:10,732
and sent to reservations
up in Northern Oregon.

402
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,534
Okay. Did they ever come back here?

403
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:15,904
No, they never regained
their original lands.

404
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:18,907
Just recently, some archaeologists found

405
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,010
the original battle site and excavated it.

406
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,349
The man downstairs thinks

407
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:33,488
that it's all Native American curse stuff

408
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,426
because he says that up the hill there,

409
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:41,830
somebody did something bad to
their Native American stuff.

410
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:48,603
He says that they were doing some...
some excavating.

411
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:54,709
They were digging stuff up,
and that's what he thinks happened.

412
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,922
I'm real sick in this room.

413
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:11,626
Really, really sick.

414
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:14,329
Do you know if there's
something causing this?

415
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:17,265
Think that some of the physical ailments

416
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,835
is due to some of the activity here.

417
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,672
Real bad, real bad.

418
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:31,045
Really bad. Oh.

419
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,067
So far, I've got clients

420
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,003
being terrorized by unexplained activity

421
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,205
and a property that's
been the site of bloodshed

422
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:53,474
between Native Americans and white settlers.

423
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:55,676
But I need to see if there's anything else.

424
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:58,812
Searching through old records,

425
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,781
I found a man named Richard Brumfield,

426
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:03,017
who committed a brutal murder in 1921.

427
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,219
Turns out, he has a direct connection

428
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:06,520
to my client's property.

429
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:10,441
As soon as I found out a murder victim

430
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:11,742
was dumped on Lori's property,

431
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,727
first call I made was to the local sheriff.

432
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,463
He said it was one of
the most horrific murders

433
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:17,898
in Roseburg's history.

434
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:30,511
So, the articles I came across
show that a body was dumped

435
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,580
on what was once my client's property,

436
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:35,232
and it was a sensational case.

437
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,918
What do you know about the guy,
Brumfield himself?

438
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,253
Well, I know Brumfield

439
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:42,373
was a very influential
professional here in Roseburg.

440
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,125
He was a dentist that
moved here in about 1909

441
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,394
and was popular in all the social circles

442
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:49,496
here in Roseburg at the time, as well.

443
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,632
Okay. So, what do you know
about the case itself?

444
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,267
Well, let me show you something.

445
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:02,076
So, this picture here is of Dr. Brumfield,

446
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:05,379
the dentist and suspect
in this homicide case.

447
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:08,716
This picture here,
this is of the victim that he murdered.

448
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:11,051
- That's William Russell.
- Now, who was he?

449
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,753
Well, William Russell
worked on a local farm.

450
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:14,054
Okay.

451
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:17,875
The doctor was looking for
someone that he could kill

452
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:21,579
and use the body to fake his own death.

453
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,698
So, he murders this guy to
make it look like it's him?

454
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,000
That's correct.

455
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:27,301
What's the motive to kill this guy, then?

456
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,570
Well, Brumfield wanted to start a new life

457
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:31,338
with his mistress up in Canada.

458
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
How's he wind up murdering him

459
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,242
and trying to make it
look like his own body?

460
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:38,812
He ends up drinking with Mr. Russell,

461
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,197
feeds him some Strychnine.

462
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,482
That doesn't kill him.

463
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:44,218
He ends up having to finish
the job with a rifle,

464
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,586
and he shoots him twice.

465
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:48,689
He places his body in his vehicle here.

466
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:51,675
Dr. Brumfield placed him in that car,

467
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:53,994
he took his own ring off of his finger

468
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,163
and placed it on the victim's hand.

469
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:57,564
Okay.

470
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,634
He actually removes the victim's dentures,
or his teeth,

471
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:04,004
and placed a stick of dynamite
in the mouth of the victim,

472
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:08,275
which ultimately exploded
and decapitated the body.

473
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,511
Then the car was doused with
gasoline and lit on fire

474
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:11,578
and pushed off the road.

475
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,914
Okay, so that's how this car winds up

476
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,083
in my client's property at that time.

477
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,284
That's correct.

478
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,970
This is the death certificate
for William Russell.

479
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,856
So, how did the cops wind up figuring out

480
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,508
that it wasn't Brumfield in the car?

481
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,928
Well, during the investigation,
the subsequent autopsy,

482
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,230
they found a document on the victim

483
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,932
in the name of Mr. Russell.

484
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,134
I mean,
this guy really thought everything out

485
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,704
except for that one little detail,
as smart as he was.

486
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:38,972
They always say there's at
least one mistake left behind

487
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:40,207
in a crime scene.

488
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:42,493
Did they catch him immediately?
What happens?

489
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:45,979
They start a search
looking for Dr. Brumfield.

490
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,665
They can't find him locally,

491
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,317
and they end up distributing wanted posters

492
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,519
throughout the Pacific Northwest.

493
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,388
How's he get caught now?

494
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,191
Well, he ends up getting identified

495
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,943
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

496
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,995
- Up in Canada?
- Up in Canada.

497
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:02,980
Okay. So, they apprehend him.

498
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:03,931
They did.

499
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,333
This was a "News-Review" article

500
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,068
when he was caught up in Canada.

501
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,938
- I'm assuming he gets extradited down here.
- He did.

502
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,740
Okay. So, does he go to trial?
What happened?

503
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:15,726
Went to trial,
he was convicted of first-degree murder

504
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:18,095
and sentenced to death by hanging.

505
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,680
Okay. So, did they wind up hanging him?

506
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,999
Actually, before he was executed,

507
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:25,452
he hung himself while we
was in the Oregon State Pen.

508
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:27,054
Copy of the death certificate

509
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:29,089
from the Oregon State Penitentiary,

510
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:32,192
showing that he committed
suicide by hanging.

511
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,873
Someone keeps saying the word "predator"

512
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,975
over and over again.

513
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:53,414
I felt something bearing down on me,

514
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:58,402
and feeling like something really large

515
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:02,790
was behind me,

516
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,858
like, running after me.

517
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,994
Like, down the hill or something.

518
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:09,263
And then I hear that predator.

519
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,209
I encountered several
entities during my walk,

520
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:23,944
but two stood out the most.

521
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:27,548
First, the creature I saw
trying to get into the house.

522
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,517
It was kind of clinging to the house.

523
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:36,890
It has, like, these really long
limbs that end in these claws.

524
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,610
Did he have, uh,
teeth or fangs, specifically?

525
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:41,662
Yeah, a lot of fangs.

526
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:44,565
Next, I described the haunted dead man.

527
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:51,321
He's about 65, pretty defined square jaw.

528
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:57,044
His nose was pretty thin,
he had pretty narrow lips.

529
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,481
Is that who you saw?

530
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,485
Yes.

531
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:28,357
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

532
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,525
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

533
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,794
and our clients for the first time.

534
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:35,681
Now, Amy, I don't know
if you picked up on this

535
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:39,134
during your walk,
but this is both a home and a business.

536
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,455
Now, on this level,
Lori lives here with Devin, her boyfriend,

537
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:46,308
and his 9-year-old daughter, Cameron.

538
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,211
And downstairs, she has three elderly women

539
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:52,047
that she takes care of as patients,
full time.

540
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,515
They live here.

541
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:56,151
And you have a caretaker, Julie,
that lives down there also.

542
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:58,520
Now, there's a lot of activity here,

543
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:01,373
and Lori's afraid for
the patients downstairs

544
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:05,060
and she thinks whatever's here
is ripping her and Devin apart.

545
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:07,763
So, now that I told Amy a little bit about

546
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,366
what's going on,
I'm gonna have her describe her walk to us.

547
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:20,575
This is a very active area,
and some of it's pretty unusual.

548
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:24,312
When I came into the house,

549
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:28,150
I saw a male laying on the floor,

550
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,684
apparently dead.

551
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:34,156
He was being tormented by something,

552
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:38,744
and I thought that he had built this place

553
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:42,731
or was the first owner of the home.

554
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:46,084
He was convinced that he
had all of these problems

555
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:49,504
because he thinks there's
a Native American curse,

556
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:52,407
and he was talking about

557
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:55,877
how something bad happened to them.

558
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:59,581
But he kept going on and
on about archaeologists

559
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:03,385
or, like, students or something,
digging up stuff,

560
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:08,356
and that that's what caused the problems.

561
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:10,492
Well, it makes sense to me a little bit.

562
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:12,811
I don't know if it's
gonna make sense to Amy,

563
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,896
because the original owner of your land

564
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,364
was a man named Rufus Beamon.

565
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:21,403
Now, Beamon was granted
320 acres back in 1850.

566
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:24,990
And your house is right in the
middle of his original property.

567
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:27,492
Now, when you talk about
the Native American curse,

568
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,078
in the 1850s,
there was the Rogue River Indian Wars.

569
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,614
Beamon was involved in the only battle

570
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:34,549
that white settlers were involved in

571
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:37,252
with the Native Americans
that the white settlers lost.

572
00:29:37,254 --> 00:29:39,321
The Americans had 39 casualties,

573
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:42,724
and I think the Native
Americans only had 15 losses.

574
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:45,427
Even though Native
Americans won that battle,

575
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,946
they all got displaced to Northern Oregon

576
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:49,231
and never came back.

577
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,166
- Now, you mentioned archaeologists.
- Yeah.

578
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:53,368
They just discovered,
only a couple of years ago,

579
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,237
remnants from that actual war.

580
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,404
Wow.

581
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:59,474
So, Amy, do you think
this is the guy you saw?

582
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:04,412
I did do a sketch of the person that I saw,

583
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:06,481
but he looked much older.

584
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,223
You guys take a look. You tell me.

585
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:17,792
Wow.

586
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:24,366
Look at the nose.
His hair's even parted right.

587
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:27,419
I've seen thousands
and thousands of sketches

588
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:28,703
during my time.

589
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:35,110
Between the eyes, the nose...
pretty damn close.

590
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:36,344
Now, do you think Beamon's your guy?

591
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:38,480
Very possible.

592
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:45,053
How did the rest of your walk go?

593
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,889
So, when I got here, I saw

594
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:51,560
that there had been a barrier
put up around the house,

595
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:54,362
which was actually a smart thing to do

596
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:56,932
because there is so much activity.

597
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:01,002
We have saged here before.

598
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:03,054
Have you done the outside of the house?

599
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,773
- Everywhere.
- Okay.

600
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:08,543
When I was walking around,
I went into the master bedroom.

601
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:11,429
And that's where I got a couple of things.

602
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:14,232
One was that you probably have abilities,

603
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:17,269
and that you may know it.

604
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:19,271
That it runs in your family.

605
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:22,307
And what happens is that

606
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:26,094
some of the dead that wander
about here will come in,

607
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,531
and they're curious about you.

608
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:32,651
And you don't know, inherently,
how to move them on

609
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:34,369
because you're not a medium.

610
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,538
You're a psychic.

611
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:40,575
Now, did you have any idea
you might be a psychic?

612
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:41,710
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,812
You didn't tell me that, did you?

614
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:44,813
I don't tell anybody.

615
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,581
Why?

616
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,351
'Cause I don't like it. I shut it down.

617
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:51,870
You know, some of the things I've seen,

618
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:53,688
I don't want to see 'em.

619
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,789
What about your family?

620
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,091
Did anybody in your family,

621
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:58,193
like your grandmother or anything like that?

622
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:01,096
My mom, my aunts, my great aunt,
all the way down.

623
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:02,163
Oh, interesting.

624
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,035
So, what else did you see?

625
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:10,405
Most of the activity that's happening here

626
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:14,092
is actually coming from two
different places outside.

627
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:19,981
The first one,
it looks almost like this very long hallway.

628
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:24,052
And what I saw coming out of it

629
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:30,025
was these really odd, mutant animals.

630
00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:32,894
One, in particular, jumps on the house.

631
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:36,748
He would bang on the house,
scratch on the house.

632
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,233
Uh, there was some growling.

633
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:43,321
And he's been doing this for a very,
very long time,

634
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,939
trying to get in,

635
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,008
but he doesn't have the
wherewithal to get in.

636
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,877
Yeah. You guys were looking at each other

637
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,912
when she was describing,
like, the scratching

638
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,047
and all this other stuff.

639
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,117
Yeah, that's exactly what
we hear all the time.

640
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:00,188
Why are you shaking, Lori?

641
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,156
It's just overwhelming.

642
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:03,725
I did do a sketch of him.

643
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,161
- Of the creature?
- Yeah.

644
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,362
Oh, I got to see this.

645
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,530
The one that I saw.

646
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,138
That's the weirdest-looking thing...

647
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,215
What does it want?

648
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,616
He wants in.

649
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,101
Oh.

650
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:33,021
What would happen if he came in?

651
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:37,192
Cause problems.

652
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,661
Geez.

653
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:41,129
So much going on.

654
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:46,534
I have come out here,
and it'd be at nighttime,

655
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,353
and I can just feel the presence

656
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:50,672
of whatever at the time it was here.

657
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:55,643
Creepy, weird things,
like, were in those trees.

658
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:59,514
That part got me afraid,
and that's where into the lay...

659
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:02,400
"Lord Jesus Christ,
leave... leave us alone."

660
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:04,586
- Mm-hmm.
- "Just leave us alone."

661
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,357
Now, you said there were
two things in the woods.

662
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,126
What was the second thing?

663
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:14,629
The second thing,
which is very near to the hallway,

664
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,948
is actually a path.

665
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,952
And so, there were all these dead people,

666
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:23,538
you know, on this, going back and forth.

667
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,074
Literally, back and forth on this trail.

668
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:28,726
It goes right through, right through here.

669
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:31,813
And occasionally, some of them wander off

670
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:34,516
and they'll come through the house.

671
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:39,354
So, due to this... pathway,

672
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:44,542
there were three things that
I think can bother you guys.

673
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:47,262
The first thing is illnesses, definitely.

674
00:34:47,264 --> 00:34:52,634
Nausea, flu-like symptoms, headaches.

675
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:56,037
And as sensitives,
this would be harder on you

676
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,141
than people who are closed.

677
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:03,394
She just described
everything you're feeling.

678
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:04,512
You haven't been well, right?

679
00:35:04,514 --> 00:35:05,647
I mean, everybody in this house is sick.

680
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:09,033
You got diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

681
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:10,552
Yeah.

682
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:13,404
But the weird part is when they're not here,
they're okay.

683
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:17,175
You look like you got a headache now.

684
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:21,729
I just feel, uh, my energy level

685
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:25,400
has just totally been sucked dry.

686
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:27,168
Okay, okay. That kind of makes sense.

687
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,203
All right.

688
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:30,155
Why?

689
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:33,908
Because the dead are here,
and it zaps our energy.

690
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,182
And the second thing I was getting was,
like, mood swings.

691
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,618
One of the main reasons we
were called in by in you

692
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,120
was because you guys are
on the verge of breaking up

693
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:47,555
because of these mood swings.

694
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:49,791
That's a big factor.

695
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:52,877
It escalates to where we just
don't talk to each other,

696
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:55,396
and we're arguing for, like, the next week.

697
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,365
They feed off our negativity.

698
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:01,336
They want us to fight,
they want us to just destroy...

699
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:03,037
- Mm-hmm.
- our relationship.

700
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,407
It's not, like, a happy home at all.

701
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:15,149
The third way the dead can
affect you is very concerning.

702
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:17,552
Some of them can make physical contact,

703
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:22,824
and I did see a female asleep,

704
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:26,527
but there was a dead person
that was actually holding her,

705
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,563
pinning her down to the bed.

706
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:31,099
It was a pretty violent thing.

707
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,618
And then I actually had
one of the stragglers

708
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,036
jump out at me,

709
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:37,472
and he just ran right up in my face

710
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:40,858
and he was, like,
kind of aiming towards my throat

711
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,278
and chest area to, like, bite me.

712
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,665
I'm wondering if that happened
to be what pushed my daughter?

713
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,685
When she was out here at the stairs,
she came running,

714
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:52,470
"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!"

715
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:55,740
She was scared.
She goes, "I just got pushed."

716
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:56,874
Mm-hmm.

717
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:58,359
I actually have a picture of his daughter.

718
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:01,179
Aw.

719
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:04,465
Now, her caretaker, Julie, got bit.

720
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,801
She's been scratched, bit,

721
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:10,071
and she said that she feels
that there are spirits here

722
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:12,607
- is all she told me.
- Okay.

723
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,543
So, the scratching, the biting,
the pushing, and all that.

724
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:17,045
Is that all the dead people?

725
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:18,680
That could be, yeah. Mm-hmm.

726
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:20,315
The dead that are here, I mean,

727
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,449
is it a threat to them?

728
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,919
Yeah. But my biggest concern

729
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:30,725
is this in-between place, and the fact that

730
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:36,297
living people can, though rarely,
but they can disappear

731
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:39,233
into this kind of parallel dimension.

732
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:41,235
What do you mean by a different dimension?

733
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:47,408
That these things are coming
from parallel universes.

734
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,847
Can we take a little break?

735
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:17,300
Living people can, though rarely,
but they can disappear

736
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:20,603
into this kind of parallel dimension.

737
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,605
What do you mean by a different dimension?

738
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:28,778
That these things are coming
from parallel universes.

739
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,216
Can we take a little break?

740
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,324
You okay?

741
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:42,158
Yeah, I'll be all right.

742
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,326
I know this is tough,

743
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:44,827
especially because you got your daughter.

744
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,095
Mm-hmm.

745
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:48,731
I'm blessed right now that
she wasn't here for this.

746
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,119
Lori, you remember the first time we spoke

747
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:54,270
and you said you were scared of this house?

748
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:55,288
Yes.

749
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,039
Well, you had a very good reason for that.

750
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,542
But we still haven't answered
your biggest question.

751
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:01,677
Is it safe for you to stay here with Devin,

752
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,080
and your patients that became your family,
really?

753
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,448
So, for that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

754
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:12,188
I hate it when this happens,
and it rarely happens.

755
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,025
But in this particular situation,

756
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:19,795
this home never should've been built.

757
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:22,732
This area never should've been developed.

758
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:28,304
There is truly something
supernatural going on

759
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:33,876
that people, way long ago, before us,

760
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:37,263
knew and respected and stayed away from.

761
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:40,516
And, unfortunately, the white man came

762
00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:44,003
and just obliterated those belief systems,

763
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:48,090
and the people who were
respecting those places,

764
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,593
we didn't listen to them.

765
00:39:52,646 --> 00:39:56,465
With that being said,
I think you should move.

766
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:02,672
I don't think that anybody should live here.

767
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:04,974
I don't think it's safe for anyone

768
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:07,043
with this situation going on.

769
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:09,178
So, what do we do with the house?

770
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,080
I mean, nobody can live here.

771
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,915
It's a lot to absorb,

772
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,718
because I've got everything
sunk into this house right now.

773
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,586
Sounds like it's just gonna get worse.

774
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:20,489
If you were to stay, you'd have to sage,

775
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:21,957
like, twice a day every day

776
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,559
until you got a shaman

777
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,645
who was from this tribe that was displaced.

778
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:29,215
What that person would be able to do

779
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:32,368
is create a protective barrier,

780
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,520
but only for the house.

781
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:38,207
The problem is,
is that you'll be safe in the house.

782
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:40,976
But you're not safe outside.

783
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,879
You can leave the house,

784
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,648
things aren't gonna follow you in

785
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,049
because you'll have the protective barrier.

786
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:50,820
But there's things all the time out there

787
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:53,723
that could potentially harm you.

788
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:55,758
So, this guy, Beamon, that was the first...

789
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,893
was probably right about
what's going on here.

790
00:40:57,895 --> 00:40:59,428
Yeah, yeah.

791
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,098
You think he brought it on,
or you think he just...

792
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,601
I think he feels guilty.
I think he thinks he did.

793
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:08,754
You know, I know the money
situation here was not good.

794
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:12,708
I mean, you sunk everything into this place.

795
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,843
I mean, what are you gonna try to do?

796
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:15,211
Do you have any idea?

797
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:19,448
I'm gonna have to get ahold of the shaman,
we'll start there.

798
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,635
I have sage in my drawer. I'll start saging.

799
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:24,019
We'll get through this,

800
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:27,189
and we'll get out of here
and we'll have a better time.

801
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:29,325
I mean, right now,
we're just living in our own hell.

802
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,329
You didn't think it was gonna be this rough?

803
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:34,864
I knew it was gonna be rough.

804
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:37,099
I just didn't know it
was gonna be this rough.

805
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:41,504
There's a silver lining,
you know what caused your fighting,

806
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:44,356
which caused you guys to be
on the verge of breaking up.

807
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:46,842
Maybe now you know why,
maybe you can work things out.

808
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:48,043
That'd be nice.

809
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:51,080
Yeah, I just got to get back to being myself again

810
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:52,581
and things might be better.

811
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:56,252
I really wish I had
better news for Lori and Devin,

812
00:41:56,254 --> 00:42:00,156
but the activity surrounding
their home is so powerful.

813
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:01,957
The only way to ensure their safety

814
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,460
is to get as far away from
this property as possible.
