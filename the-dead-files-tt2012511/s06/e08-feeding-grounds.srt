1
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:14,207
Probably a lot of different deaths,
a lot of violent deaths.

2
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,177
It just seems like it's
getting worse for everyone.

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,579
He says, "Those [bleep] got to go."

4
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,715
He shoots himself with the same rifle

5
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,250
that killed his stepdaughter.

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:24,835
That's a twist.

7
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:27,621
Someone said, "That's the room of death."

8
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,624
My son whispered, he says,
"That's a bad guy."

9
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,392
Would you say they're a threat?

10
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:38,198
Something wiped everybody out.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,867
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,270
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:46,173
What's happening?

14
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:47,274
I see dead people.

15
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:49,709
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,411
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:53,079
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,514
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:56,149
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:59,619
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:01,188
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,511
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,328
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,996
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,731
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,301
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:12,502
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:13,937
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,239
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,974
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,010
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,211
...until the very end.

33
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:22,879
You got problems. I got news for you.

34
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,165
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,250
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:28,518
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,588
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,691
I'm in Sumpter, Oregon.

39
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,694
It's a small mountain town about
two hours from Boise, Idaho.

40
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,712
Now, we got called in by a couple

41
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:58,465
that live and work in a B&B in town.

42
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,817
They want to turn the
business over to their son,

43
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,920
but the activity's gotten so
violent and physical lately,

44
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,839
they don't know what to do,
and they're worried.

45
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,091
They sound scared and
desperately want us to find

46
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,427
a way to keep the B&B in the family.

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,207
Before Amy arrives,
I look for any leading information.

48
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,927
Photographs, antiques, and personal items

49
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,246
can influence her findings.

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,417
So it's important I
cover or remove them all.

51
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,686
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:56,339
There is a lot of physical pain here.

53
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,476
My whole head hurts a lot,

54
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:03,447
and there's a lot of dead people here.

55
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:11,054
They all died horribly
and I would say violently.

56
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,248
Barb, I'm glad to be here.

57
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,251
This is beautiful place,
but you got a problem here.

58
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,253
Yeah. We love the place.

59
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,039
We've had it for 17 years,

60
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,042
and we've always had little things happen,

61
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,627
but it just seems like

62
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,147
it's getting worse for our guests,
for everyone.

63
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:40,016
Now, Barb, as far as activity goes,
what are we talking about?

64
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,269
We hear noises that we can't explain,

65
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:45,088
things are moved,

66
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,873
people feel sick.

67
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,842
And now it's getting really physical.

68
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,126
People are being touched.

69
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,195
I'm just concerned, you know, because we...

70
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,830
Like I say, it's our home first,

71
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,649
and you want to be happy in your home.

72
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,101
And then when we have people come in,

73
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:01,288
we want to feel that they
are safe and secure here.

74
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,708
What do you know about the
history of the building itself?

75
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,196
That it opened in May of 1900
as Sumpter General Hospital.

76
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,214
- So this was a hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,215
That was what it was built for.

78
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,466
Okay.

79
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:15,585
You're looking to retire and
turn this over to your son,

80
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,170
- is that right?
- Yeah, that was the idea.

81
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,792
And he's got two little kids.

82
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,528
I just...

83
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,598
I want to make sure that
they're safe when they're here.

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,034
- How attached are you to this place?
- I love it.

85
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,203
I guess we just really thought,

86
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,789
"Oh, that building just needs to be"...

87
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,344
"Needs some love and attention."

88
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:50,270
What the hell?

89
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,822
There's quite a few dead women here.

90
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,564
They seem to be from a while ago,

91
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:06,636
maybe 1890...

92
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,906
like 1905?

93
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:14,277
One of the ladies is the representative

94
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,015
and head honcho of these other four women.

95
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,656
I don't know why they got stuck here.

96
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,160
They didn't die all at the same time.

97
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,065
There's a man.

98
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,533
Mm.

99
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,235
He doesn't look good. He's a little old man.

100
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:42,439
He's mean. He is ornery.

101
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,057
Ow.

102
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:49,946
He definitely can make
physical contact with people.

103
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:51,781
He's pinching and poking.

104
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,418
I don't like him.

105
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:01,591
Okay, what's going on in here?

106
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,994
We keep hearing loud bangs,

107
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,113
like an encyclopedia,
heavy book being dropped flat

108
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:08,331
on a wooden floor.

109
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,749
And we'd get up. We were in bed.

110
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:11,551
We'd get up, and we look all around.

111
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,420
We don't see anything that made a noise.

112
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,055
And what about guests?

113
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:16,356
No, there were no guests.

114
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,657
Well, this is a B&B.

115
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,326
You sure nobody came in
to try to get a room?

116
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,544
There wasn't anything.
I mean, we both looked.

117
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,580
Anything else in this room?

118
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,831
Yes. One day,

119
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,683
these doors were propped
open like they are right now.

120
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:27,851
Okay.

121
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:31,871
I'm in the other room,
hear a noise, come out here,

122
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,791
and this picture is lying facedown

123
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:37,594
right here on the floor.

124
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,999
It would have had to come
up and over and down.

125
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,167
Okay, so when you...

126
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,702
It was just a couple minutes before,

127
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,671
you saw the doors like this.
Yes, yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,005
And that picture was...

129
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,874
Was lying facedown right there.

130
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,326
Now, any guests?

131
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,327
No guests.

132
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,528
So nobody else was in the building?

133
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,629
No one.

134
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,682
I can't even figure out,

135
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,267
unless it fell and came through here,

136
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,620
but even that's pushing it.

137
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,572
I can't even figure out how to debunk that.

138
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:09,693
Now, have any guests had issues
with things moving on their own?

139
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,328
A lot of guests have experienced that.

140
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,497
Their glasses. Okay.

141
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,949
Kick their shoes off here

142
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,418
and find them over there the next morning.

143
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,370
That's bizarre.

144
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:26,076
The old man, he's tired of these women.

145
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,063
He's trying to keep them out of the house,

146
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:33,083
but it's not working,

147
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,719
and I think he really hates the lead one.

148
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,955
They've had fights,

149
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:42,058
and it's affected their environment.

150
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,195
Some objects moved or thrown.

151
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,497
And, like, the electricity

152
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:51,568
definitely was affected in those situations.

153
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,577
I spoke with your wife.

154
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:01,778
Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,713
And she was telling me
about some of the things

156
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,115
you got going on here.

157
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,616
It seems like you got a bit of a problem.

158
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:09,419
The increased activity in
the last couple of years,

159
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,421
especially in the last few months,

160
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,873
has given me some concern.

161
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,125
Has it hurt business?

162
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,560
In recent months,
there have been three or four times

163
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,195
where, in room six,

164
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,363
somebody has sensed

165
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,949
that somebody had crawled
into bed with them.

166
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:27,003
And in one case, I had a young lady up there

167
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,757
who said the next morning that,
whatever it was,

168
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,393
was breathing in her ear,
and it startled her.

169
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:36,012
She woke up, and she yelled.

170
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:39,382
What if that had been
somebody that had a bad ticker

171
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:42,352
and was fairly old, you know?

172
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,637
What kind of experience are
you having in the house?

173
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,524
Electrical problems drive me crazy.

174
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,643
Lights going on and off by themselves,

175
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,829
timers going off.

176
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,247
What about the wiring?

177
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,132
Wiring's all brand-new.

178
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,034
Have you seen anything else,
heard anything else?

179
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:59,169
Yeah.

180
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,588
A friend of mine and I
were here in the kitchen,

181
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,773
and looking up here...

182
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,676
and I can only see it from the knees down...

183
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,679
something or someone came down the stairs.

184
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,681
There wasn't anybody in here,

185
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,134
and the back door was locked upstairs.

186
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,486
Okay, so you guys go up there
and check it out, though?

187
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:18,121
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

188
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,223
There's nobody there.

189
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,758
Amy once in a while will tell people this...

190
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,626
"You got a serious problem
that's gonna get a lot worse.

191
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,161
You need to get the hell out of here."

192
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:28,097
What would you think if you heard that?

193
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,850
Blood, sweat, and tears for 17 years

194
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,735
have gone into this place.

195
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:37,490
Yeah, so it would be really
hard to just walk away from it.

196
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,125
Okay.

197
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,428
Can the living see this angry man?

198
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,348
Yes, and he looks creepy.

199
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,517
His face is a horrible mess.

200
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,937
It's like if he took ash

201
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:54,073
and was trying to re-create his face.

202
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,526
Ohh, I feel dizzy.

203
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,528
I don't feel good.

204
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,197
He's hurting living people.

205
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:29,787
So, Brian,
I was taing to your mom and dad,

206
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,338
and your mom was expressing concerns

207
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,557
about your kids being here.

208
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,510
Do you have the same concerns?

209
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:40,564
My son comes here,
and he's seeing imaginary people,

210
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:42,428
and he doesn't see them at my house.

211
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,444
He even refers to them as "the bad people."

212
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,646
Putting him down for a nap,

213
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:48,131
and he points over at
the chair in the corner,

214
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:53,987
and in a very different voice,
he says, "That's a bad guy."

215
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,057
Needless to say, it was just ominous.

216
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,925
So what about you as far as experiences go?

217
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,377
I have had one.

218
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,531
I was in my room,
and the bed that I'm on started shaking.

219
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,534
I actually thought, "Oh, earthquake?"

220
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,736
Jumped off the bed, looked, still shaking,

221
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:12,439
and nothing else in the house was moving.

222
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,841
Well,
how big of a shake are we talking about?

223
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:18,428
I was getting moved,
so it was like, you know, moving.

224
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,946
- That hard?
- Yeah, yeah.

225
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,882
So, I know your mom's got cats.

226
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,735
I literally looked to see if there was,
like, a cat that crawled up underneath,

227
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:26,420
and there isn't even a space under there,

228
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,537
so it's not possible.

229
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:32,092
I don't want it around.
I don't want my kids around it.

230
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,461
I don't want to have to
talk about that with them.

231
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,170
I don't like it in here.

232
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:52,112
These women come in here,
and they're all dressed in black.

233
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,681
I don't like them back here.

234
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:58,518
They're not the same as
when they're downstairs.

235
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,022
These women are creepy, man.

236
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,360
This could be what the old
man was talking about...

237
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:16,536
But I think him trying
to get rid of these women

238
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:21,241
might ultimately not be such a bad thing.

239
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:24,878
He very much has the attitude of,

240
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,113
"This is my house." You know what I mean?

241
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:28,982
"And those [bleep] got to go."

242
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,326
Kari, I understand

243
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,194
you're actually staying in the
hotel tonight in this room.

244
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,395
I am.

245
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,531
Okay, is this the first
time you're staying here?

246
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,800
No, I've stayed here two other times.

247
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,468
Kari, have you had any experiences

248
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,503
while you've been here?

249
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:53,073
I've seen a woman about three times.

250
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:57,444
The first night I stayed here,
I woke up, and there was a woman.

251
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:02,399
To me, she just looked like a
black figure walking around.

252
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:05,435
So I fell back to sleep,

253
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,621
and I woke up to turn over on my bed,

254
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,689
and there was that same dark figure

255
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,992
actually sitting on the side of this bed

256
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:16,471
and looking into the mirror
and brushing her hair.

257
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,905
Were you boozing that night?
Were you drinking?

258
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:19,273
No.

259
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:22,092
Okay, so you said you saw her three times.

260
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,144
When was the third?

261
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,512
The third was actually last night

262
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,680
when I stayed in this room.

263
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,882
- Last night?
- Yeah.

264
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,751
I was looking up towards the wall,

265
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:34,187
and the next thing you know,
there's a skeleton face.

266
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,522
You're just frozen.

267
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:39,359
You don't know what to say,
or you can't scream.

268
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,511
You can't do anything.

269
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,347
Why do you come back?

270
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:45,115
It brings up curiosity.

271
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:49,303
You want to come here and see
if anything's gonna happen.

272
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:52,706
I doubt that anything is gonna happen to me.

273
00:13:55,109 --> 00:14:01,448
They've been busted in
this room, the ladies...

274
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,786
Like, somebody waking up in here

275
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:10,857
and catching them doing [bleep] to the,
you know, person.

276
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:16,096
'Cause I keep seeing this
one thing over and over again.

277
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,298
Like, them surrounding the
bed with the people in it.

278
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,084
And they would definitely have that feeling

279
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:24,104
of, like, they couldn't move,
they couldn't talk,

280
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:28,025
they can't breathe.

281
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,046
So it sounds like you're experiencing a lot.

282
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,815
I mean, anything else happening?

283
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,484
Since I got in this house,
I just felt drained.

284
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:38,735
I got, like, physically ill.

285
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:40,537
Describe what you mean by ill.

286
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,924
Like, you felt like you were
just about ready to throw up.

287
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,911
When I got into his room, I just felt tired.

288
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,330
I felt like I had just been drugged.

289
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:53,283
You can hardly breathe
when you get into here.

290
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,921
And the women are definitely

291
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:01,007
feeding off of any living people around.

292
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,878
They move through, like, in a pack,

293
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,647
and then they just kind of feed.

294
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:15,922
They're definitely taking
energy away from living people.

295
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,258
How would that affect the living?

296
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,998
If the person woke up while
the ladies were doing it,

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,571
then they would feel like
they couldn't move and stuff.

298
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:36,410
But if they don't,
then they would feel really awful.

299
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,994
Would you say they're a threat?

300
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,446
Mm-hmm.

301
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:42,399
If you were exposed to this consistently,

302
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,085
you'd probably have a heart attack

303
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:47,337
or develop severe issues.

304
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,624
This is a small town.

305
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,960
It only has a couple
hundred people living in it,

306
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:10,629
so it didn't take me long to
track down a local historian.

307
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,398
She tells me that Jay and Barb's B&B

308
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,651
has a long and dramatic history.

309
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,312
So, you had mentioned that the
building I'm investigating,

310
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,715
that's now a B&B, had a dramatic history.

311
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:30,983
Yes, it has.

312
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,585
And my client thinks it
opened up as a hospital.

313
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:34,953
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

314
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,823
JB Stoddard, and there's a picture of him,

315
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:41,376
he and his wife, Esther,
bought the property in 1899,

316
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:45,630
and then they built a hospital,
and it opened in June of 1900.

317
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:49,701
And it operated as a hospital until 1917.

318
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:51,420
Now, do you know anything about this guy?

319
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,987
He was definitely a very smart businessman.

320
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:55,606
He was born in Utah,

321
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:59,793
and he and his family were
in the lumber industry there,

322
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,445
and he came here, started a mill.

323
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,881
Most of the buildings in Sumpter

324
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,582
were built with lumber from his mills.

325
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:09,653
Now, did he own the hospital
the entire time it was open?

326
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,239
No, he sold out in 1903.

327
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,025
He sold to a couple of the
doctors who worked there.

328
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:17,895
Okay. All right.

329
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:19,346
Now, what eventually happened to him?

330
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:21,915
He passed away in 1925.

331
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,685
There's a copy of his death certificate.

332
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:29,907
He died of dementia. He was 68.

333
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,481
This grumpy old man confuses me.

334
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:40,684
I think he owned this at one point.

335
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,186
Do you get an age for him?

336
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:48,191
He's... Gosh, like 70s.

337
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:53,030
Doesn't look like he died very well.

338
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:56,400
Skin and bone.

339
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,236
Definitely mentally unsound.

340
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:02,739
He's very frail.

341
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:10,614
Maybe he has Alzheimer's or something.

342
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,384
You blink, you go through this town.

343
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,353
Why would they build a hospital here?

344
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,789
At that time, this was quite a metropolis.

345
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,958
There were about 4,500 people here.

346
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,910
Really?

347
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:25,929
Here's a picture that
shows Sumpter at its peak.

348
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:30,233
It shows the wood streets,
the Capital Hotel.

349
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,569
Then going up the street, that's the school.

350
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,271
Okay, this white building here?

351
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:35,555
Right.

352
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,574
And then next to it is what
was the hospital at that time.

353
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,277
We had all kinds of miners

354
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,229
and then all the supporting industries

355
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:43,480
that go along with that.

356
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:45,515
Okay, now,
what kind of mines we talking about?

357
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,683
- Gold mines.
- Gold.

358
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,752
Yes, so there were cave-ins,

359
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,971
crushing injuries, and those kinds of things

360
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:53,523
where a hospital was definitely needed.

361
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,560
Now, did the townspeople use the hospital,
as well?

362
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:57,728
Yes, they did.

363
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,364
There were people that had
all kinds of injuries...

364
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,200
burns from house fires, horseback injuries,

365
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:06,169
flu epidemics, moms having babies.

366
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,904
So that hospital covered everything?

367
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:09,806
Absolutely.

368
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:16,413
Oh, God, the head pain is ridiculous.

369
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,799
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

370
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,519
Do you know what it's from?

371
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:27,224
Well, people being hit in the head.

372
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:34,097
I don't know what's happening.

373
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:38,802
There's been a lot of loss here, you know...

374
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,822
women having miscarriages.

375
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,375
Uh...

376
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:46,777
What?

377
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:52,349
There's a big old blood stain on the floor.

378
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,018
I can't make it go away.

379
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,386
How large is it?

380
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:59,139
It's pretty [bleep] Somebody bled out.

381
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:04,528
Quite a lot of people,
quite a lot of different deaths,

382
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,396
a lot of violent deaths.

383
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,932
Who the [bleep] knows what happened there,

384
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:12,302
but there is something there.

385
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:25,332
There's someone throwing up a lot, crying,

386
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:28,468
and they're dying 'cause they're sick.

387
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,190
Ow.

388
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:38,695
You said the hospital
closed down in 1917. Why?

389
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,348
There was a fire in August of 1917

390
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,335
that destroyed nearly all of
the business area in Sumpter.

391
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:49,673
Wow.

392
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:53,960
I'd say 99.9% of the businesses
and quite a few residences

393
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,846
were destroyed.

394
00:20:55,848 --> 00:21:00,517
And then this shows the
destruction after the fire.

395
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,820
Wow.

396
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:06,857
Those were two of the
bigger buildings in town,

397
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:09,276
and it just totally destroyed them.

398
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:11,211
Did the B&B I'm investigating get hit?

399
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:12,212
No, it didn't.

400
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,397
It was right on the edge of the fire.

401
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,349
Now, do we know how it started?

402
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,401
It started at the Capital Hotel,

403
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,438
and the it spread quickly
'cause of the wood streets.

404
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,173
Oh, geez.

405
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:24,908
Did people die in this fire?

406
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,327
There is one article that speaks to the fact

407
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,080
that two miners were killed.

408
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,119
Okay, so the fire happens in 1917,

409
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:38,989
and it stops being a hospital,
so what happens after that?

410
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:43,293
It became the Masonic
Hall in 1918 until 1973.

411
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:45,796
After the fire, the town never recovered.

412
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:07,717
It's really strange because I...
I see it more crowded.

413
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,954
It looks different.

414
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:23,800
Like I'm actually seeing more of a town,
I guess.

415
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,703
Okay.

416
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:30,590
There's like a wooden, like,
sidewalk or something.

417
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,443
Like, they're just kind of showing me,

418
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,445
like, things were good,

419
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:39,282
and then, uh...

420
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:43,386
a few things happened to stop that.

421
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:45,422
What do you mean?

422
00:22:45,424 --> 00:22:48,358
Something wiped everybody out.

423
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,468
So far, I've got a town
that was nearly wiped out by a fire

424
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,573
and a property that was once a hospital

425
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:12,222
where countless people died,

426
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,158
but I need to see if there's anything else.

427
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,044
Searching through the archives,

428
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:18,912
I discovered the hospital's first patient

429
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,814
is a miner named Fred Kane.

430
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:25,369
Turns out, he went crazy and
brutally murdered a 4-year-old

431
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,688
before turning the gun on himself.

432
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,560
Obviously, I want to know
more about this case,

433
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,596
so I've called a local police chief,

434
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,731
and he agreed to look into it for me.

435
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,203
Well, Chief Lohner, thanks for meeting me.

436
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:44,638
I appreciate that.

437
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,106
The Fred Kane murder case,

438
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:48,309
you were able to look into it for me.

439
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:49,192
What were you able to find out?

440
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,659
I found that Fred Kane,
he was a miner up in the Sumpter area.

441
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,895
He actually had went to that hospital

442
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:57,865
that you're investigating
back on June 12th of 1900.

443
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,400
He was actually the first
patient of the hospital

444
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:03,437
after being kicked by a horse
up at the Montezuma Mine.

445
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:06,841
So, this is before the murder.

446
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:08,042
It is.

447
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:10,411
A few months later, on September 19th,

448
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:11,579
up at the family cabin

449
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:13,781
where Fred Kane lived with his wife, Naomi,

450
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:16,083
and her 4-year-old daughter,
his stepdaughter,

451
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:18,052
a young gal by the name of Ruth Toney,

452
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:22,006
Fred... He took his Winchester
rifle and left the residence.

453
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:24,025
And when Fred came back into the cabin,

454
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,127
he fired a round from his Winchester,

455
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,629
and that actually shot through Ruth

456
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:31,299
and entered the body of Naomi at the time.

457
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:36,554
The child is dead instantly by
every report that we could find.

458
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:39,163
- Okay, what happens next?
- Fred picked up a club,

459
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,246
and he started beating Naomi with the club,

460
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:43,352
and then, all of a sudden,
he stopped beating her,

461
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:44,846
and he looked at her, and he said,

462
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:46,779
"You got blood on your dress."

463
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,448
So this guy's a whack job.

464
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,775
You know, see, there had been no
indication of any mental illness

465
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,963
with Fred Kane prior to this occurrence,

466
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:55,997
but he obviously was suffering
from some type of mental delusion

467
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,999
at the time if you believe Naomi's accounts.

468
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,534
Now, what does she do?

469
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:01,536
She told him that there
had been another assailant

470
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,438
in the residence that had shot her

471
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,273
and that's where the blood came from,

472
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,576
and she said he just ran out into the woods.

473
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:09,255
And so Fred took off out the door.

474
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,355
She then fled the cabin
as soon as he was gone,

475
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:13,524
and she went to a nearby
cabin where she was located

476
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:15,326
by two workers that had been in the area.

477
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:17,829
He came back to the residence,
saw Naomi was gone,

478
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,697
saw the child lifeless on the floor,

479
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,332
and he set the cabin on fire.

480
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:23,584
And in the meantime,

481
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,703
he takes off and runs
to his brother's cabin,

482
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:27,455
which is just a short distance away,

483
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:30,091
lights it on fire,

484
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,243
and the report indicates
that he shoots himself

485
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,011
with the same rifle that
killed his stepdaughter.

486
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,313
Geez.

487
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:38,349
He shoots himself in the chest,
but he actually survives.

488
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:41,085
He ultimately ended up at
Sumpter General Hospital

489
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:42,286
just two hours later

490
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:44,989
after Naomi had been admitted
to the same hospital.

491
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:49,994
Okay, so both of them wind up in
the location I'm investigating

492
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:52,196
but when it was a hospital?

493
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:53,931
Correct. Both with gunshot wounds.

494
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:57,835
Fred ultimately died of his
injuries on October 10th.

495
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,787
Okay, now, what happens to Naomi?

496
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:02,006
She ultimately was
released from the hospital,

497
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:04,258
and she ended up up in Portland,

498
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,878
where she actually died
exactly six years to the day

499
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,129
of the original shooting.

500
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:11,015
She died on September 19, 1906.

501
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:12,884
She was 35 years old at the time.

502
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:15,219
Kind of the irony on this, with the theory

503
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:18,589
that Fred was insane at
the time of the shooting,

504
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:22,260
was that she died by what
the medical examiners report,

505
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:25,229
the death certificate states
is a general collapse,

506
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:28,149
the contributing factor being insanity.

507
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:29,567
You're kidding me.

508
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,152
No.

509
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,570
Well, that's a twist.

510
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:43,281
There's a couple of the
women who are extremely depressed.

511
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:48,119
Like, if they were still alive,
they would be suicidal,

512
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:52,156
you know, that's how depressed they are.

513
00:26:52,158 --> 00:26:55,993
One of them lost her whole family,

514
00:26:55,995 --> 00:27:00,998
and she still feels that,
like, it happened that day.

515
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,639
She can't move beyond that loss.

516
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:19,784
I encountered several
dead people on my walk.

517
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:23,271
But the woman surrounding
a man asleep in his bed

518
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,439
had me the most concerned.

519
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:30,861
There's about five women who
are at the foot of the bed

520
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:33,464
staring at this man.

521
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:37,702
And at the center is a dominant female.

522
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:42,873
She has dark brown hair, dark brown eyes,

523
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,610
thin, arched eyebrows.

524
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:52,550
She has a high-collared,
black, very plain dress on.

525
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,003
Is this what you saw?

526
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:59,257
Yes, that's what I saw.

527
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,212
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

528
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:27,347
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

529
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,733
and our clients for the first time.

530
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,288
Amy, I'd like you to meet Barb and Jay.

531
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,529
They're a married couple,

532
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:38,997
and they live and run this place
as a B&B for the last 17 years.

533
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,667
They've always had activity,

534
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,953
but recently, it's gotten out of control.

535
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:48,307
They're looking to pass
this on to their son,

536
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,775
who has two beautiful children.

537
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:52,144
Oh.

538
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,313
The problem is, they're really not sure

539
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,915
if it's safe to keep this
business in the family.

540
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,969
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

541
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:03,355
she's gonna tell us about her walk.

542
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:07,993
This was a really difficult walk for me,

543
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,829
feeling, you know, really physically ill.

544
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:13,398
Actually up there... top-10 worst.

545
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,900
Wow.

546
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:18,170
There's a lot of sickness here.

547
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:23,675
As soon as I got out of the car,
it was like chaos ensued,

548
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:28,477
and a lot of, you know,
dead people were freaking out.

549
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:34,249
A lot of them that I encountered
outside had died horribly.

550
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:38,053
Necks were broken,
heads were just bashed in.

551
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:43,158
And the head and the neck pain
that I felt out there from them

552
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,528
continued all throughout the walk.

553
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:51,533
And then I went upstairs
and saw a lot of sickness.

554
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:54,903
I saw a woman who had a miscarriage,

555
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:59,107
a huge bloodstain on the floor,

556
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:01,426
and then another woman
in one of the bedrooms

557
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:02,761
who seemed to be very ill.

558
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:06,064
Like, sweat and vomiting and all of that.

559
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:10,018
You know, that's an easyone to answer.

560
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,671
This building was built in 1900
but not as a bed-and-breakfast.

561
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:13,889
It was built as a hospital.

562
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:15,423
- What?
- Yeah.

563
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,259
Oh, my gosh. Oh.

564
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:22,414
The thing was,
it operated as a hospital from 1900 to 1917.

565
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,567
Back in that time,
there was 4,500 people living here.

566
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:26,635
Okay, okay.

567
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:27,836
This was a mining town.

568
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:29,671
When you talked about head injuries

569
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:31,089
and all this other stuff.

570
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:35,644
So these guys were killed by cave-ins,
explosions.

571
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,013
I got a stack of articles

572
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,881
talking about all these
injuries that happened here,

573
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,050
and they were all brought to this hospital.

574
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:44,886
Matter of fact,
this was the hospital for the whole town.

575
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:48,123
Oh, that makes sense.

576
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,443
A mining town would explain
probably the physical injuries.

577
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:55,413
And this being used as a
hospital explains the illness.

578
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,884
So, what else did you get?

579
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:01,002
There are about five or six women.

580
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:02,971
They kind of travel as a pack.

581
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:06,007
They're definitely from around 1890, 1905.

582
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,110
One of the women was all dressed in black

583
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:10,679
and seemed to be mourning.

584
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:14,216
She definitely seems to be
the leader of the group.

585
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:18,470
They all died at different
times from various illnesses.

586
00:31:18,472 --> 00:31:20,839
Does that make sense
'cause it was a hospital here?

587
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,173
Well, now it does, yeah.

588
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,025
Let me ask you a question
about the women that are here.

589
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:25,293
Do you think they can be seen?

590
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:29,097
I definitely think that the
main lady presents herself.

591
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:31,800
Jay, tell her what you saw that day.

592
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:35,203
Well, I was in the kitchen,
and out of the corner of my eye,

593
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:37,973
glanced up here on that staircase,

594
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:40,809
and something came down,

595
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:44,379
and I could see its legs
from maybe the knees down.

596
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,947
What did the legs look like?

597
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:47,315
Shadows.

598
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:48,934
Mm-hmm, okay.

599
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:51,453
There were two women from this group

600
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:54,556
that were extremely depressed.

601
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,642
The living would probably
feel this depression

602
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,894
because it's so thick.

603
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:03,098
One of the women lost
her whole family at once,

604
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,601
and she can't get over it.

605
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:12,641
She seems hopeless and lost,
crying all the time,

606
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,343
suicidal, even though she's dead.

607
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:18,363
She lost her entire family in one day?

608
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:19,497
Yeah.

609
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:21,182
Now, there's one woman that comes to mind

610
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,934
that ended up here when it was a hospital

611
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:24,519
that had a very traumatic experience.

612
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,922
Her name was Naomi Kane,
and her husband, Fred Kane,

613
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:30,925
was actually the first
patient in this hospital

614
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:33,161
when he got kicked by a horse.

615
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:35,864
Now, on September 19th that same year,

616
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:38,266
Naomi was holding her 4-year-old daughter

617
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,635
from a previous marriage in her arms.

618
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,938
Fred came into the house with
a rifle and shot at them.

619
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:48,576
The bullet went through the baby,
killed her,

620
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:51,246
and then went into Naomi.

621
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,866
Somehow she escapes and gets
taken to the hospital here.

622
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:56,468
Fred, in the meantime,

623
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,854
lights the house that they lived
in on fire and shoots himself,

624
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,940
but he survived.

625
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:03,525
Somebody found him,

626
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,393
and they brought him to this hospital,
as well.

627
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:07,762
He wound up dying about three weeks later.

628
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:13,118
Six years to the day after the shooting,

629
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,170
she dies at the young age of 35.

630
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:17,572
The official cause of death
on her death certificate says

631
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:20,608
general collapse from insanity.

632
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,445
How do you die from insanity?

633
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:24,596
I think she committed suicide, to be honest.

634
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:26,014
That's what I'm thinking, too.

635
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,082
Seems to fit.

636
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:28,883
Do you have any sense that

637
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:31,286
she may be one of those women?

638
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:33,121
Yeah.

639
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:40,695
Then I met this interesting character.

640
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:41,730
He was in the back over here.

641
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:43,365
That's their bedroom.

642
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,035
He kind of was throwing attitude,

643
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:50,472
definitely grumpy,
kind of crotchety older man.

644
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:53,992
He was probably in his 70s.

645
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,127
He felt like this place belonged to him,

646
00:33:56,129 --> 00:34:00,598
so I was thinking he either
owned it or he lived here.

647
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,984
He definitely didn't have a good death.

648
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:07,522
His face was not in good shape.

649
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:08,807
And then, he, like, runs up,

650
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,775
and he starts, like,
pinching me and poking me.

651
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:13,128
Barb, can you explain to Amy

652
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,431
what your son and your grandson
experienced in one of the rooms?

653
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes. He was putting him down for a nap,

654
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,802
and so he was lying on the bed with him,

655
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:23,037
and the grandson pointed at a chair,

656
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,989
and there wasn't anybody in the chair,

657
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,093
but then he said, "That's the bad guy."

658
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:31,513
You mention you think he owned the place?

659
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:32,914
Yeah.

660
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:35,700
Well, the original owner is a guy,
James Stoddard,

661
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:39,587
that had businesses in town with the lumber.

662
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:40,622
He had this place for like three years,

663
00:34:40,624 --> 00:34:41,956
and he sold it to some doctors.

664
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:44,359
He knew they needed a hospital here,
and he built it.

665
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:47,429
You said the guy was in his 70s.

666
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,230
This guy died at the age of 68.

667
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:52,517
You mention he had a horrible death.

668
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,169
This guy actually died from dementia.

669
00:34:55,771 --> 00:35:00,308
So more than likely,
this is the guy, the same...

670
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,776
- Sounded like it.
- Sure seems like it.

671
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:02,944
Yeah.

672
00:35:02,946 --> 00:35:05,146
- Mischievous, yeah.
- Mischievous old codger.

673
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:06,147
Yes.

674
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,449
Mm.

675
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,784
It doesn't surprise me that
this man is still here,

676
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,853
as the dead often come back to the place

677
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:14,205
which had the most meaning in their lives.

678
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:19,494
There's a lot of stuff going on
between him and the dead women.

679
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:22,447
He does not like them at all.

680
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:25,467
He said that this is his house

681
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:28,052
and that those [bleep] need to go.

682
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:30,922
There's been about five or six times

683
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:34,042
where him and the main
lady got into a fight,

684
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:37,962
and I saw, like,
physical things happening around them

685
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:39,864
because of this exchange.

686
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:43,985
Specifically, I saw,
like, electrical issues.

687
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:46,571
And this is only when they're fighting.

688
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:48,807
That explains a lot of things, right?

689
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,024
Yes, it does.

690
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:53,628
Upstairs, the TV going on and off by itself,

691
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,915
lights going on and off by themselves.

692
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,833
There's nobody to turn it on.

693
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:01,970
And does this happen often?

694
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,521
- Recently, yes.
- Last little while.

695
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:06,357
We really don't want anyone
to just get frightened to...

696
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,311
I mean, to have a health issue because of...

697
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,664
You got a legitimate issue here.

698
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:17,819
Initially, I didn't like the older man,

699
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:22,207
and then I went upstairs
and saw the women up there,

700
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:24,592
and it was a very different story.

701
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:27,145
Are they different women, or...?

702
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:28,913
No, it's the same women.

703
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:31,583
Up there, what they were doing

704
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:34,485
was taking the energy from the living.

705
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:35,720
Yeah.

706
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:40,325
And they just all stand around the bed

707
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,861
and literally are just, like,
almost breathing it in.

708
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:45,930
The main woman does know what she's doing.

709
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:48,483
And she's doing it to sustain herself.

710
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,703
I spoke to one of your guests

711
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:53,304
that was staying here that night I was here.

712
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,306
She said she just felt like the whole energy

713
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,609
just got sucked right out of her.

714
00:36:57,611 --> 00:37:01,229
We've had guests on more than one occasion

715
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:05,900
that have sensed somebody
sitting on the edge of the bed,

716
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:07,285
crawling into bed with them.

717
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,404
That's exactly what's going on.

718
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:13,608
I did a sketch

719
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,961
of what people may encounter
when they're in the bed.

720
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,878
Yeah.

721
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,614
That's really frightening.

722
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:39,450
I mean, anybody that comes here... the kids,
the grandkids...

723
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:43,705
I don't want them to be
afraid to go upstairs.

724
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,115
I did do a sketch

725
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:06,636
of what people may encounter
when they're in the bed.

726
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,305
Yeah.

727
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:28,274
That's really frightening.

728
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:31,528
I mean, anybody that comes here... the kids,
the grandkids...

729
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,832
I don't want them to be
afraid to go upstairs.

730
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:42,522
<i>I</i> don't want to be afraid to go upstairs.

731
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:46,993
You know, it would be nice
if the family could continue

732
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:52,474
to come here and live here
and be happy and safe...

733
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:54,357
Mm-hmm.

734
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,577
...for them to love this
place as much as I do.

735
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:02,365
Your son Brian told me
a story about the bed.

736
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:04,284
Mm-hmm.

737
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:06,837
He was awake in bed,

738
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:11,725
and, all of a sudden,
the bed started to shake.

739
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,077
Okay.

740
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,362
When he described it to me, I mean...

741
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:16,413
It was shaking.

742
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,448
That could be her.

743
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:28,792
She's strong, and she can be
very physical and very forceful.

744
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:33,630
If somebody irks her,
she definitely will let them know.

745
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,166
But if you're exposed to that consistently

746
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,734
over a long period of time,

747
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:41,855
it can cause serious
illnesses and heart issues

748
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,773
and things like that.

749
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,776
Wow.

750
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:54,084
You know, you don't want to
pass something like this on

751
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,418
to your son and grandchildren.

752
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:01,258
No, I wouldn't do that until
this issue is resolved.

753
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:04,828
How do we stop her?

754
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:08,098
We want to put a stop to it.

755
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,688
Well, guys,
I know this has been a lot tonight,

756
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,806
but at least you know what's going on.

757
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,392
The big question is,
can you stay here safely

758
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:22,112
and pass it on to your
family like you want to?

759
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:25,148
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

760
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,317
Okay.

761
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,388
So, first off, there needs to
be a pastor who's brought in,

762
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,092
and this individual needs to do a blessing

763
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:41,765
and needs to tell the women
and the other lost souls to go.

764
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:44,184
And this needs to be a
direct order from him.

765
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:47,270
It needs to be firm.

766
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:50,140
What this will do is,

767
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:55,111
all of the women will leave,
and the older man will leave.

768
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:57,480
The second thing is,

769
00:40:57,482 --> 00:41:02,702
you need a person who is a Reiki
master and does home cleansings,

770
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:04,754
so that's a healer,

771
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:09,826
to come in and do a cleansing
of the whole location,

772
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:11,861
and that's gonna get rid of, like,

773
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:14,864
all of the residual illness and trauma

774
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:17,584
that's been kind of absorbed here.

775
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:19,686
And that'll get rid of all that stuff

776
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,004
that's here with the hospital?

777
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:22,038
Yeah.

778
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,445
You look like you feel like...

779
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,146
I am so relieved.

780
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:33,650
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

781
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:35,235
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

782
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:37,554
It's got to make you feel good

783
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:39,589
you could keep this place in the family now.

784
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,157
Yes. Absolutely.

785
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,695
It's a happy cry.

786
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:50,900
It won't be easy
removing the layers of dead

787
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,902
inside this location.

788
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:56,239
But with the help of a
pastor and a Reiki master,

789
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:58,074
the dead will be set free.

790
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:59,676
And I believe Jay and Barb

791
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,561
can pass down their bed-and-breakfast

792
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,613
to future generations.
