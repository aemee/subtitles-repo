173
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:15,053
Ah! That hurt.

174
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:18,724
I know what he **** looks
like now, to me.

175
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,758
Very professional,

176
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,029
dark brown hair,

177
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,899
average build,
as far as I can tell.

178
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,635
He does have a coat on.

179
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,304
This angry man had been
attacking me throughout my walk,

180
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,340
but now that I can see
what he looked like,

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,976
I actually started
to feel a little sorry for him.

182
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,617
He had a very, very
**** stressful life.

183
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,585
Very **** stressed

184
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,055
about work.

185
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,858
You mentioned that he had some
tragedy in his life?

186
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,529
Yeah, some years before
a couple of his sons
were going through

187
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,733
an apple orchard,
and this man suddenly appears

188
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,867
and telling them
to get out
of the apple orchard.

189
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,404
Then he takes a shotgun
full of buckshot...

190
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,105
...and starts firing 'em at the kid.
- You all right?

191
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,644
There's a lot of pain
in his head.

192
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,649
And, the oldest son, George,
got hit I the face,

193
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,753
and he didn't die, but it
disfigured him horribly.

194
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,089
[whispering]

195
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:29,394
And then, I see trees around me.

196
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,064
That's when things get sketchy,

197
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,568
but then he came back here.

198
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,570
It's a tragedy,

199
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,573
but 8 years later, 1926,

200
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,541
the doctor gets

201
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,678
a house call and he decides
to take George out with him,

202
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,480
and the house call
is around the Des Planes River.

203
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,383
George got out of the car,
evidently, and he went

204
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,152
and he sat on the edge
of the bridge
looking down at the river.

205
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,155
This guy, he fell down--

206
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,457
he slipped on the ice.

207
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,661
Meantime, Dr. Gindele comes back
and the kid's missing.

208
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,497
They finally found his body
a couple of weeks later
downstream.

209
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:10,037
- This had to devastate him.
- Oh, it had to,

210
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,338
and it just broke him up.
It just destroyed him.

211
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,507
Maybe he kinda
snapped a little

212
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,342
when it-- when, you know,

213
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:20,045
'cause he's not dealing with it.

214
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,079
It triggered his pain

215
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,083
and he got really angry

216
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,020
pretty quickly.

217
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,991
Losing your own child
in such a traumatic way

218
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,593
has to be unbearable,
and after I tracked down

219
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,630
one of Dr. Gindele's
grandchildren I found out
just how bad it can get.

220
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:51,576
This is a picture of Dr. Gindele

221
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,579
and his oldest son, George.

222
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,414
He had a nervous breakdown

223
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,918
and as a result
he went and lived

224
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,687
in Oak Park
with one of his sisters,

225
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,223
and my grandmother stayed
in the house with the children.

226
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:09,361
So, he just left them there?

227
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,631
Well, yes.

228
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:22,507
I feel very tired here.

229
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,576
Just...

- This might be that old lady.
- Okay.

233
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,759
Something about
the family is broken.

234
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:44,730
She felt really lonely,

235
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,366
confused.

236
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,304
I don't like it.

237
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,972
- It's a little **** unnerving.

gonna do that?

Amy, I want you to meet Mark,

00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,344
his wife, Lori, and his
daughter, Cristina.

247
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,647
Now, Cristina is actually
the one who called us in.

248
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,383
Even though she doesn't live
here she's still getting
tormented by nightmares.

249
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:42,186
Now she has a 3 year old
daughter who's having
similar dreams,

250

and she's getting very
concerned about it.

251
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:47,158
When I first met Amy,

252
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,562
I was really anxious
and nervous

253
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,332
about what she was going to
reveal to us.

254
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,602
I'm outside and I meet this guy

255
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,605
who's definitely the most

that's in this house.

258
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,810
He looked very professional.

259
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,781
He was obsessed with his work--

260
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,016
extremely stressed out man.

261
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,084
This house was
occupied by

262
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,088
a guy by the name
Dr. George Gindele.

263
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,591
Chicago had a big
tuberculosis outbreak.

264
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,628
He treated a lot of
those patient's right here
in the house.

265
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,531
He had 10 kids here.

266
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,668
That's a lot of stress.

267
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,439
I was curious if this

268
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,574
could possibly be
the guy you saw?

269
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,044
I did do a sketch of him.

270
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:45,115
- You guys take a look
at the sketch. - Wow!

271
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,087
Wow, is right.

272
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,256
That's the apparition I saw.

That's the guy I saw.

Oh, my God!

275
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,764
I didn't know what we were
dealing with or who,

276
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,334
or what was actually going on
here, so when I looked

277
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,170
at that picture,
it just became real for me.

278
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,439
Now, did you get anything else
from this guy?

279
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,609
He had had two big accidents
during his life.

280
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,612
The first one I saw
was that he slipped on ice.

281
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,615
The other one I saw,

282
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,917
he was all bloody

283
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,087
and there was something
wrong with his eyes.

284
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,524
I have nothing that says
Dr. Gindele had any accidents,

285
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,693
but there were two events
in his life

286
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,196
that basically destroyed him.

287
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,334
This is the doctor
and this is his son, George Jr.

288
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:41,441
- The guy that lived on the farm
decided to take a shot at him. - What?

00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,442
Shot him in the face and neck,
so this kid was disfigured.

291
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,615
I had a nightmare one night,

292
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:53,084
and there was a boy

293
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:55,988
who looked like he was
in his late teens

294
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,957
and he looked like he had
been shot in the head

295
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,860
because half of his face
was missing.

296
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,962
At that moment,

297
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,766
I just couldn't
hold my composure anymore,

298
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,835
because it had been such

299
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,871
a horrifying dream for me.

300
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,307
It was something
that I felt trapped in

301
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,543
and I didn't even
live here anymore.

- You all right?
- I'm okay.

00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:48,607
Now, you mentioned
falling into the ice.

307
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,643
George Jr, in April of 1926

308
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,545
fell accidentally,

309
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,981
or he jumped into
the Des Planes River.

310
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,350
I have his death certificate.

311
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,352
It just says
"Accidental drowning."

312
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,589
This eventually destroyed
Dr. Gindele.

313
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,491
- He moved out of his house, left
his wife with their nine kids... - What?

314
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,829
...moved in with his sister,

315
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,898
and left her here alone.

316
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,834
Now she stayed here until
she died in 1960.

317
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,735
This is his wife, Julia.

318
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,771

Oh, my gosh.

319
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:24,109
Could this be
the woman you saw?

320
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,811
Yes.

321
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:29,715
With him-- you'd experience him
in a lot of very different ways.

322
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,318
I did do another sketch of
something that he does.

323
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,591
- That's really freaky.
- He's touching you.

324
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:44,897
When the second sketch came out

325
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,031
with me being assaulted

326
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,967
it really kind of
freaked me out,

327
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,002
because I didn't realize

328
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,037
it was just us imagining things

329
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,039

really happening,

330
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,575

I know you guys got
overwhelmed with a lot
of information tonight,

332
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,348

can you live here

333
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,450
without all the torment
and protect your

334
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,219

the same issues?

335
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,221
The first thing would be
to get a clinical psychologist

336
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,125
who practices providing therapy.

337
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,194
The second thing is

338
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,897
you need to bring in
a chaos magician.

339
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,933

340
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,067
how do we fix that,
or can it be fixed?

341
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,971
When you wake up you need
to tell them

342
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,107
"You get out of my house.

343
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,708
You leave me alone--
you leave my daughter alone."

344
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,111
Will it affect her daughter?

345
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,845
- Well, that remains to be seen.
- Are you going to do what Amy suggests?

346
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,484
I'll do my best, but that
psychologist isn't for us.

347
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,320
He'll have to leave.
We'll force him to leave.

348
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,557
Are you seriously gonna do that?

349
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,143
(Mark)
Immediately following the
investigation it seemed like
everything was calm,

350
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:08,913
however after a few weeks
things started
picking up again.

351
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,882
There's has been a lot
of strange things
still happening here.

352
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,918
When Amy told us

353
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:17,055
what to do in the reveal,

354
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,091
I still feel what she said

355
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,259
is probably the right
thing to do.

356
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,294
We're following Amy's advice

357
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,397
in that we're going
to do something,

358
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,700
but we're going to do
it in a way
that's comfortable for us.

359
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:37,209
Peace be with this house
and to all who live here.

360
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,311
Amen.

361
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,480
I've known Mark and Lori
for approximately 16 years,

362
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,850
and Mark asked if I would do
a blessing of the house

363
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,819
to get rid of whatever
was going on,

364
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,689
and it
was quite an experience.

365
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,825
We did have a priest come in

366
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,894
and perform a house blessing

367
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,762
in hopes that that solves
the problem.

368
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:01,466
We ask that this water call
to mind our baptism in Christ

369
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,470
who has redeemed us
by His death

370
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,039
and resurrection.

371
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:11,176
Father Bob got my entire
family together
in the heart of the house,

372
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,945
in our dining room, where
we had an opening prayer...

373
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,947
Peace be with this house

374
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,016
and to all who live here

375
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,318
and for this we pray.

376
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,370
Lord, hear our prayer.

377
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,322
Lord, hear our prayer.

378
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:28,193
(Mark) I assisted Father Bob by going
with him room to room...

379
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,794
...holding the holy water while he continued
to bless each room of the house.

380
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,499
(Father Bob)
Let this water call to mind

381
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,568
our baptism in Christ.

382
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,504
He took us through

383
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,508
the entire home blessing each
room from top to bottom.

384
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,279
Let this water call to mind
our baptism in Christ

385
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,081
who has redeemed us
by His death and resurrection.

386
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,218
Bless this house
and those that live in it.

387
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,989
I asked Father Bob
to say a prayer
for the soul of

388
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,956
Dr. Gindele and his family.

389
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:02,961
If he's lost and trapped
in darkness and death I wanted
to help him move on.

390
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,630
In His great love the God
of all consolation

391
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,668
gave us the gift of life
and to all who have passed,

392
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,669
especially Dr. George Gindele

393
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,971
and his family--

394
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,141
may they all have a place
of light and peace.

395
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,144
In the name of the Father,
and the Son...

396
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,049
...and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
- Amen.

397
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,016
Immediately after the blessing

398
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,985
there was a feeling of calmness

399
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,254
that overcame us.

400
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,423
It was a peaceful feeling.

401
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:36,093
Hopefully, we do see a
difference and we can
assume a normal life.

402
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,030
In the week
of the investigation

403
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,000
my daughter has not had

404
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,136
any nightmares,

405
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:48,006
but since my parents
haven't done what Amy suggested,

406
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:52,177
I still don't feel safe here.

407
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,451
(Amy)
I know that not everyone
will be comfortable
with my advice

408
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,587
but Dr. Gindele
suffered greatly in life

409
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,123
and now in death he poses
a serious threat.

410
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,126
Even though it's not exactly
what I recommended,

411
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,229
I really do hope
that this blessing
will bring peace

412
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,332
and that Cristina's nightmares
come to an end.

413
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:29,781
If you own a restaurant
your odds of failure
are overwhelming,

414
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,117
but throw in reports
of violent paranormal
activity at your place

415
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,753
and it's
a recipe for disaster.

416
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,556
Our clients
at The Catfish Plantation
in Waxahachie, Texas

417
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,559
were under constant threat,
and it was on us to fix that,

418
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,363
or they would have to walk away
from their own family business.

419
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,469
So Shawn, you sounded pretty
concerned on the phone about
what's going on here?

420
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,237
My daughter works up here--
she's 16 years old.

421
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,341
My mother, my husband
and my dad are up here,

422
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,179
and we've seen apparitions,
shadow people,

423
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,849
things moving around,
so it pretty much
runs the gamut.

424
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,785
So why are you
calling us in now?

425
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,620
Things have seemed to kind of
start picking up, like objects,

426
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,157
you know, being thrown at people
in my kitchen,

427
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:16,027
and my daughter, Amelia,
was physically slapped.

428
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:19,562
So we're worried about her.

429
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:22,066
I was really concerned about

430
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,001
the safety of people
in the restaurant,

431
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,370
primarily my family,

432
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,806
and that was the breaking point
right there, you know,

433
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:31,709
don't slap one of my children.

434
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,212
Now, what do you know about
the history of this place?

435
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,781
There's a legend
about a love triangle

436
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,783
that occurred near
this location

437
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,219
where a young lady
was murdered.

438
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:57,802
[crickets chirping]

439
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,805
(Amy)
Every walk I do is dangerous,
and I always try to stay safe,

440
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:04,341
but the entities I encountered
here needed my help so badly

441
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,479
that I had to risk everything
if I was going to help them.

442
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,452
I'm getting
a really weird smell.

443
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,419
What a weird smell.

444
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,456
What is this?

445
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,559
Blood. It's blood.

446
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,593
I'm tasting it.

447
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,695
Yeah. Yeah, it's blood.

448
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,298
Ugh.

449
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,435
- Did you have any idea it might
be haunted? - (narrator) Next...

450
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,937
I'm not right!
This is not right anymore!

451
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,673
...Amy is overpowered.

452
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,641
Uh, and then I can't breathe

453
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,944
and it hurts.

454
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:42,214
[crying]

455
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,323
[whispering]

456
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,426
A restaurant kitchen
can be a dangerous place.

457
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:57,828
There's hot ovens, knives,
open flames.

458
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,498
So when Shawn told me
people had experiences in there

459
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:03,835
I knew that cuts and burns
were going to be
the least of their problems.

460
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,735
I have had what appeared
to be scratches,

461
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,872
like three--

462
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,875
one, two, three scratches
appear on my arm.

463
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,278
In my experience, working
with Amy, that could be
a problem.

464
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,280
Working in a kitchen environment
is very dangerous

465
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,851
in and of itself,
and if you have
a wildcard,

466
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,353
like something
throwing objects,

467
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,522
someone could
really get hurt.

468
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,558
(Steve)
Anything else in the kitchen?

469
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,658
I was here one day
and I see something like

470
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,795
a white apparition.

471
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:32,797
It looked just like a person.

472
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,733
It had arms and such.

473
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,768
Okay.

474
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:44,108
This area is not good.

475
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,077
I'm seeing a weird shadow

476
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,413
of a female...

477
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,054
...and her arms are long
and thin.

478
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,227
She's stretching out.

479
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,363
I have been jumped a lot
during my walks,

480
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,432
but this was the first time
that I actually allowed
it to happen.

481
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,435
[groaning]

482
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,339
Are you okay?

483
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:18,009
No. She can't feel
her arms or legs.

484
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,745
And she can't breathe.

485
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,782
****

486
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,585
Why are my arms so long?

487
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,654
[panting]

488
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,857
Oh, my God! What's happening?

489
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:36,494
Oh!

490
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,365
I'm not right.
She's not right anymore!

491
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,467
Something terrible's
happened to her!

492
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,470
Oh! My arms!

493
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,004
Oh, my God!

494
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,541
She can't find what she's
looking for.

495
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:52,410
That moment was one

496
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,312
of the most
painful and terrifying

497
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,415
I've ever experienced,
but it allowed me

498
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,551
to start seeing what was really
going on there.

499
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,323
She's a mess. She's a mess.

500
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,095
She does not understand
what's happened to her.

501
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,202
(Steve)
Despite all of Shawn's
unexplained experiences

502
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,538
she seemed to be handling
the stress very well.

503
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:24,109
Her husband, on the other hand,
was still coming to terms
with what he'd seen.

504
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,684
When you bought this place
did you have any idea
it might be haunted?

505
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,319
No. I was a total skeptic.

506
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,854
What changed your mind?

507
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,491
One time I came in through
the back door
and passed one of our

508
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:42,592
assistant managers who was
working there,

509
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:46,030
and all of a sudden
this loud bang crash
happened right behind me.

510
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,267
What we call our "fish racks"
flew over his head

511
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,336
and landed right
in the middle of the kitchen.

512
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,877
(Amy)
Being jumped was exhausting.

513
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,712
I almost couldn't continue
my walk, but once I got outside,

514
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:05,649
I picked up
on the young girl again
and had to find out more.

515
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,753
She throws things in here--

516
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,788
in the kitchen.

517
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:14,559
She looks scary to people.

518
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:24,101
[bell rings]

519
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,072
She's trying to understand

520
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,073
what is going on.

521
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,076
She's getting

522
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,645
panicked again.

523
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,746
And then I can't breathe

524
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,783
and it hurts.

525
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,486
Like she can't breathe.

526
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,725
I think this girl
is being murdered.

527
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,165
[groans]

528
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,634
This doctor is apparently
interested in her

529
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,535
in a romantic way.

530
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,803
(narrator)
Next...

531
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:00,971
She might be dying.

532
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,940
...an unhealthy obsession
turns deadly.

533
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,310
He hits her once in the head
twice in the body.

534
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,948
[whispering]

535
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:19,690
[whispering]

536
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,226
(Steve)
Shawn had mentioned something
about a love triangle
that ended in murder.

537
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,128
I know a story like that,
no matter when it happened,

538
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,498
would have made headlines.

539
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,067
Normally, I would have to go
to the local archives,

540
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:33,103
but I caught a break
when I found a local police
chief who knew all about it.

541
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,614
April 30th of 1929,

542
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,950
there was a young lady murdered
on that property area.

543
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,586
Miss Lola Roller,

544
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,121
and this doctor,

545
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,257
Dr. Harry Dowling

546
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:56,928
is apparently interested
in her in a romantic way.

547
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,996
So what does she wind up
doing next?

548
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,098
She leaves the Temple area
and comes to Waxahachie

549
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,233
to get away from him.

550
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,937
She comes up here
where her uncle lives,
Mr. H.L. Hempkins.

551
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:09,307
Well, Dr. Dowling
forced his way in.

552
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,376
Mr. Hempkins gets ahold
of the Sheriff.

553
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:15,113
They find Dowling
and her are involved

554
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,516
in a physical altercation
going on at that time.

555
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,057
(Amy)
At first, I wasn't sure
if allowing this girl
to jump me was a good idea.

556
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,258
But I finally
started picking up on

557
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,262
what she went through
and it began to pay off.

558
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,865
I hear the men talking.

559
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,132
There's like...

560
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,636
three of them.

561
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,872
I feel pain.

562
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,344
Some kind of pain.

563
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,815
The Sheriff can see
that Dr. Dowling has a weapon.

564
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:56,720
The Sheriff tries to get the gun
away from Dr. Dowling.

565
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,323
- Dr. Dowling fires three shots
at Miss Lola... - Okay.

566
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,494
...hits her once in the head,
twice in the body.

567
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,168
Oh, God!

568
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,737
**** She can't move.
She's so angry.

569
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,006
She can't move her
**** legs.

570
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:18,042
Mr. Hempkins,

571
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,111
from behind the Sheriff,

572
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,147
shoots Dr. Dowling
and hits him in the head.

573
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:26,650
See how much it hurts

574
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,687
and then I can't breathe.

575
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:38,363
She thinks
that she might be dying.

576
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,947
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Shawn and David.

577
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,150
They are part owners
of the Catfish
Plantation Restaurant.

578
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,019
There's a lot of activity
in this place

579
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,021
and their concern is--

580
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,056
is it safe for them,

581
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,091
their family and their guests?

582
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,027
During the reveal
I was concerned

583
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,296
that Amy would find

584
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,264
something really bad
after all the blood,

585
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:16,667
sweat and tears, literally

586
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,569
that I've put into this place

587
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:22,573
it would be totally devastating
for our entire family.

588
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:29,380
I was in the bathroom area,
and I started to get

589
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,216
this really intense
negative feeling.

590
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:34,285
I felt a woman near me

591
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,155
and then I did something
that I very rarely do--

592
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,758
I let her jump me.

593
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,860
(Steve)
Is she trying to communicate
through you?

594
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,663
What was going on?

595
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,166
Well, I can show you,

596
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,868
'cause we have
Matt's camera, so...

597
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,104
Let me see it.

598
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,706
- Oh, my God! What's happening?
- (narrator) Next...

599
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,777
I don't like that you did it
to be honest with you.

600
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,913
...will crimes of the past

601
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,349
It would be devastating
for our entire family.

602
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,852
...condemn this restaurant's
future?

603
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,221
She, uh-- she feels trapped.

604
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:23,134
[whispering]

605
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,570
(Steve)
Is she trying to communicate
through you, or what
was going on?

606
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,439
Well, I can show you,

607
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,376
'cause we have
Matt's camera, so...

608
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,745
Let me see it.

609
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:37,415
Oh, my God! What's happening?

610
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,417
Oh, my arms!

611
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,086
Oh, my God!

612
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,791
Something terrible's
happened to her!

613
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,860
Seeing what Amy had
experienced--

614
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,896
it kinda upset me.

615
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,065
It made me feel really bad.

616
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,068
I was really concerned
about her well-being.

617
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,102
I don't even know what
to say about this.

618
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,971
I don't like that you did
it to be honest with you.

619
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,973
What is this woman's deal?

620
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:05,008
What's the story with her?

621
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,578
She's very confused and scared.

622
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,647
She's constantly

623
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:13,283
reliving her-- her death.

624
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,987
I think I have an answer,
but I'm not sure.

625
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,056
Back in 1929, on April 30th.

626
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:22,860
Her name was Lola Roller--
she was 19 years old.

627
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,429
Dr. Harry Dowling
fell in love with her

628
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,465
and she wanted nothing
to do with him.

629
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,467
He drives up,
goes to the door-- knocks on it.

630
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,370
The uncle answers...

631
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,672
he went to go get his
gun and then get the Sheriff.

632
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,540
When they come back,

633
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:40,409
the doctor-- he's got a gun
in his hand.

634
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,148
The Sheriff tried to get
the gun away from him--
a fight ensues.

635
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,317
The doctor, he puts one in her
head, two in her chest.

636
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,553
Oh.

637
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,156
When Steve shared Lola's story
with us-- it was very sad.

638
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,426
She was trying
to get away from this person,

639
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,960
and there was nothing anyone
could do to stop it. - It was very tragic.

640
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,298
She does not know
that she's dead.

641
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:05,136
The way that she sees herself

642
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,605
is basically like a shadow,

643
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,641
and her limbs

644
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,310
are extremely long and thin.

645
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,379
I kind of thought that maybe...

646
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:18,814
...that's how living people would
see her... - Okay.

647
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:22,252
...like a female shadow that's
kind of distorted.

648
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:25,990
I'm having trouble understanding
how that would actually look.

649
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,192
Well, I did do a sketch.

650
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,529
(Steve)
Well, that's odd.

651
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,700
Take a look at that.

652
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,873
Wow!

653
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,975
I've seen that.

654
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,044
This is very upsetting to me.

655
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:49,779
So, is it possible
that the shadow thing

656
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,749
she's seen is Lola?

657
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,786
Yes.

658
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,159
My biggest hope
is that Lola is going to
find some sort of peace

659
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,361
and not blame herself

660
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,731
for her own murder

661
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:11,468
and not have to relive
those experiences over
and over again.

662
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:14,674
- (Steve) What does she do?
- Well...

663
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,741
she will break things.

664
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,843
She'll throw things around, um,

665
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:22,647
especially in the kitchen.

666
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,649
We have our racks

667
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,350
that we use for cooking,

668
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,786
and I was almost out of
the kitchen

669
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,756
and they flew
off the shelf

670
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:35,793
and flew over our
assistant manager's head
and landed right behind me.

671
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,195
Oh, wow.

672
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,164
Now, one of the biggest
reasons we're here

673
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,868
is she's been scratched
on her left arm.

674
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,269
Show Amy where
you were scratched.

675
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,172
It was just right like that.

676
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,709
Just like three
fingernail marks.

677
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,777
Wow...

678
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:56,046
that's her.

679
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:58,014
(Steve)
We still haven't answered

680
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:01,452
your most pressing question.

681
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,620
Is it going to be safe here
for you,

682
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,721
your family, your guests?

683
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,758
And even more importantly...

684
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,965
...is it going to be okay for you to pass
it on to your kids? - Right.

685
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,531
For that answer I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

686
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:16,366
As far as she's concerned,

687
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,969
there are two people
you need for this.

688
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:22,873
You get another medium,
and a grief counselor.

689
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,875
So they have to come together,

690
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,011
the medium and the counselor?

691
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,629
Yes.

692
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,147
Okay.

693
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,216
The medium might get jumped,

694
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,086
so they should take this
slow and steady.

695
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:38,989
The grief counselor

696
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,926
will really take over
as far as counseling

697
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,861
this person who's dying.

698
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,129
(Steve)
I gotta ask the question
I ask all my clients.

699
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,134
Are you gonna take Amy's advice
and do what she says?

700
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,220
Since the investigation
the activity has pretty
much been the same.

701
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,323
Because so many people
were having all
of these experiences

702
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,959
and because we had
so many people coming in
in general,

703
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,995
I felt it was very important

704
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,029
to follow Amy's advice

705
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,032
to make sure this was a safe

706
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,168
environment for everyone

707
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,370
including our guests.

708
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,445
We're going to get Lola moving
towards a better

709
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,447
afterlife experience.

710
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,552
[clock ticking]

711
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,722
The first person that came in
to assist us was David,

712
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,290
and he is a grief counselor

713
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,861
in addition to
being a psychic medium.

714
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,895
This is where I feel

715
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,065
a female energy is in this room.

716
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,100
Um, and this female

717
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,937
that I'm feeling in here.

718
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,372
I'm feeling a tremendous

719
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,374
amount of, like,

720
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,410
she's weeping.

721
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,278
When I was with David,

722
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,380
we basically went through
the restaurant

723
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,883
and got what his impressions
were about

724
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,118
the different types of spirits
that were here.

725
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:18,355
He immediately did
pick up on Lola.

726
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:20,658
She did come forth
for him immediately.

727
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,627
Because when I come in here,

728
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,663
um...

729
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,970
[crying]

730
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,672
she's talking about how she--

731
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:39,442
she feels trapped.

732
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,380
The grief of this female
is occupying this space.

733
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,850
She just feels that she
is not going to move on.

734
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,884
One of the things

735
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,853
that David helped do

736
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,055
is to reassure

737
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:55,726
that Lola's actually
making that transition

738
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,795
and is feeling

739
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,998
more confident
about her situation.

740
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,166
(David)
What's going to be
a process of time--

741
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:05,435
you're going to have to work
with her to build up that trust

742
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:08,105
is what I'm feeling with her,
and then she'll be ready.

743
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,708
I feel that she is gonna
eventually move into the light

744
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,909
and move into the spirit world,
and I think that you

745
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,579
will be able to help her
do that, so that's--

746
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,218
...that is what I'm feeling
is going on in here. - Okay.

747
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,123
(Shawn)
After David came in we had
assistance from Amanda,

748
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,225
who is a medium

749
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,493
and does a slightly different
process than David.

750
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,063
Do you have one that
likes to bang the pans?

751
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,998
They like to move the pans
around, yeah.

752
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:38,467
The fact that you're acknowledging her
and her grief is helping. - Okay.

753
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,238
Lola has trust issues.

754
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,041
She has developed
a relationship with Shawn.

755
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,076
Shawn has been working
with her,

756
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:49,212
so she was comfortable
talking to her.

757
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,148
Let's go where you feel her
the strongest.

758
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,785
(Shawn)
I-- okay.

759
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,521
(Amanda)
"It's my fault. It's my fault
It's my fault" is what I'm
getting with her.

760
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,389
So find a way to say

761
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:02,092
"You were a victim--
you couldn't help it."

762
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,161
Amanda suggested

763
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,163
that I need to speak with Lola

764
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,567
and help her to
cross over to the other side.

765
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,770
Lola, honey, you were
not responsible

766
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,272
for anything
that happened to you.

767
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,473
Lola, he can't hurt you
anymore.

768
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:20,343
He's not physically
able to harm you.

769
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:22,246
You have control

770
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,349
and it's totally fine
for you to let go.

771
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,555
Yeah, I'm getting that she's
listening to you.

772
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,625
Her energy is going from dense
to more light.

773
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,493
Okay. This is why this
is a good spot for her,

774
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,395
so if she's not ready to go, but at least
she can help elevate... - Right.

775
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,533
...she's not stuck.

776
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,537
- She's lifting.
- Okay.

777
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,241
Now that we've gone forward
with Amy's advice.

778
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:54,144
I feel like it's
helped me to understand
a little bit more

779
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:57,247
why I'm in the position
that I'm in.

780
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,283
I think that this is something

781
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,518
that we can live with
and work with,

782
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:03,754
and I believe that
everything is headed

783
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,256
in the right direction
at this point.

784
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:15,131
(Amy)
Lola has endured unimaginable
pain in life,

785
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,101
as well as death,
so I'm relieved to see

786
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,170
that Shawn followed my advice

787
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,506
and is personally helping her
to move on.

788
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,308
As long as Shawn
keeps an open dialogue
with Lola,

789
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,678
I'm hoping that
they'll both find peace.
