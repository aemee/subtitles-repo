1
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,949
There's this creature thing.

2
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,384
People worship it.

3
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,450
It's sucking the life out of me.

4
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,312
Intense pressure.

5
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:21,578
It was so cold,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,973
and I just wanted it to go away.

7
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:26,671
It's causing sickness.

8
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:29,999
My dad is so sick,
and no one can figure out why.

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:34,526
They just get tortured
by this [Bleep] thing.

10
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:37,261
"You're mine. You can't escape."

11
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:40,457
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:41,682
What's happening?

13
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,080
I see dead people.

14
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:45,512
It seems like a devil.

15
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:48,147
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,145
He's pissed off.

17
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,309
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,443
I felt real fear.

19
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,412
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:57,419
I think she's being murdered.

21
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,023
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,288
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,286
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,384
Serial killer pops in my head.

25
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:07,584
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:08,783
Nobody believes me.

27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,246
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,511
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

29
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,244
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,278
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,479
...until the very end.

32
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,245
You got problems. I got news for you.

33
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,445
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,512
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

35
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,779
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,882
This is their house, the house of the dead.

37
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,005
I'm in Abilene, Texas.

38
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,535
It's a small city about
two hours west of Dallas.

39
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,300
Amy and I were called in

40
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:55,432
by a retired Air Force veteran named Sean.

41
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,700
Sean knows danger when he sees it,

42
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,336
but he says that whatever's in this house

43
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,468
is trying to kill him.

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,869
I really hope we can help this veteran out.

45
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:09,837
Before Amy arrives,

46
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,804
I look for any leading information.

47
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,939
Family photos and religious icons

48
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,638
can influence her findings.

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,273
So it's important that I
cover or remove them all

50
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,475
before she begins her walk.

51
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:44,534
I saw this church,

52
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:48,032
and it was filled with
people and it was all good,

53
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,700
but the church fell apart,
and the roof fell in.

54
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:56,436
Then there's, like, this...creature thing.

55
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:04,614
It creates paranoia and anger

56
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:08,752
and fear and negativity
and obsessive thoughts.

57
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:15,027
And it told me that it
can only take the souls

58
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,993
of those who damn themselves.

59
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:21,999
But it'll take on any
form to help them do that.

60
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,739
Well, Sean, I'm glad I'm here now

61
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,607
'cause I'm a fellow vet like yourself,

62
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,275
and when we spoke on the phone,
you sounded pretty upset.

63
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,410
So why don't you tell me what's going on?

64
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,612
We have apparitions.

65
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,715
There's banging on the wall.

66
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:47,087
Touching people, objects moving.

67
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,525
I've been in some pretty rough situations,

68
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,961
and what I've seen in Afghanistan and Iraq

69
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:55,065
doesn't compare to what
I've seen in this house.

70
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,102
Are you sure it's not post-traumatic stress,

71
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,906
- anything like that?
- No.

72
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,709
What makes you so sure?

73
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,209
I've gone through counseling, evaluations.

74
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,414
You name it, I've had it,
and nobody can explain it.

75
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,117
Now, who lives here with you?

76
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,688
We have eight family members in my house.

77
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,587
- There's my mom...
- Okay.

78
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,357
...and myself and my wife, Elizabeth;

79
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,361
my oldest daughter is Tracy;

80
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:22,097
my oldest son, Sean Jr.;

81
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,033
my middle daughter, Rebecca;

82
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,934
and then my middle son, Derek;

83
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:29,069
and my youngest son, Nicholas.

84
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,504
Now, let me ask you something...

85
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,207
do you know any history
about the house at all?

86
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,506
I know that the land, originally, way back,

87
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,809
was Native American land.

88
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,747
Okay, so how long are you living here?

89
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,381
We've lived here since June of 2006.

90
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,815
Okay, so why are you calling us in now?

91
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,151
When we first moved here, things were minor.

92
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,286
And over the last couple of years,

93
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,024
things began just getting
a lot more extreme.

94
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,993
Shortly after that happened,

95
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,525
my health started to deteriorate.

96
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,224
What kind of health issues
are we talking about here?

97
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:58,658
I've had a stroke.

98
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,729
I've had major embolisms with blood clots.

99
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:04,835
I've got problems with my heart,
with my liver, with my lungs.

100
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,104
I've gone to every type
of doctor you can name,

101
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,073
and they don't have answers.

102
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,642
Okay, how old are you?

103
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,678
- 38 years old.
- You're 38.

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,013
This is stuff 75-years-old go through.

105
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,379
Here I have some pictures.

106
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:20,914
As you can see, I was a fit person.

107
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,380
I look much different.

108
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,748
My life has gone on a complete turn

109
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,246
since everything started.

110
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:29,317
- You feel whatever's here is trying
to physically harm you. - Correct.

111
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,454
I believe it's sucking the life out of me.

112
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,877
I'm seeing this creature thing.

113
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,922
It's causing a lot of
sickness for living people.

114
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:01,659
They can't breathe.

115
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:06,794
Intense pressure on their chest,
their stomach.

116
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:10,333
To me, it's weird that the thing is in Texas

117
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:13,569
and in a neighborhood like this.

118
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:17,238
I think I know what this creature is,

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,773
but I'm not sure because

120
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:21,476
it's something usually seen
in other parts of the world.

121
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,748
Whatever it is,
I know it's capable of causing major damage.

122
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,684
People here...

123
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:31,488
they just get [Bleep] tortured
by this [Bleep] thing.

124
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:41,137
This room is very active for me.

125
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,074
I was sleeping in bed with my wife.

126
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,945
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

127
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,582
My son Nicholas woke up screaming.

128
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,749
I get up to pick up my son,
and he's pointing.

129
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:53,489
And I look over here towards the closet,

130
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:55,490
and both doors are wide open.

131
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:58,094
I know when I went to bed,
the doors were closed.

132
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:00,098
Did they open by themselves

133
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,732
'cause they were off-kilter or something?

134
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,833
No, they have a device in the top of them

135
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,203
that clicks in place.

136
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:06,938
- So you remember shutting it.
- Correct.

137
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:14,045
I see what you're saying. So it locks in.

138
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,515
Anything else in this room?

139
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,116
So one morning, I wake up,

140
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,752
I walk across the hallway right there,

141
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,021
and as I step up into the laundry
room to go into the kitchen,

142
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,491
I feel this just ice-cold
hand grab the back of my neck

143
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,027
and squeeze my neck.

144
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,162
At the same time,
I'm kind of looking to see who's behind me.

145
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:32,467
There's nothing there.

146
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,270
This creature thing is, like,

147
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:41,374
putting its hands on their shoulders.

148
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,742
And it almost feels like
if you took your finger

149
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,110
and, like, pushed all the way back.

150
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:50,047
It's like this intense, sharp pressure.

151
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:54,353
So, anything else?

152
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,956
I had woken up, opened my eyes,

153
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:02,257
and I see a figure... completely black.

154
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,727
It was very lanky, tall.

155
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,360
He scuttled across the ceiling,

156
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:06,760
and then its head turned,

157
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,861
and it just real fast looked at me.

158
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,931
It was human-somewhat-looking,

159
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,800
but it had large eyes that were sunken in.

160
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:15,903
It didn't really have a distinct mouth,

161
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,771
but it looked angry.

162
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,739
So it wasn't anything like a shadow

163
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,173
- coming from outside that
could have made that? - No.

164
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,843
- Cat walking by, anything crazy?
- No, no, no.

165
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,715
The feeling that I get from this thing

166
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,718
is that it's looking for me.

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,285
It's after me.

168
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:33,258
- You think it wants to get you out
of the picture here? - I think so.

169
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,026
And my fear is that once it does,

170
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,093
it's just gonna move on to my family.

171
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,704
This creature thing...

172
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:49,205
I see it on the ceiling.

173
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,172
So that's interesting.

174
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:57,413
It's just, like, hanging there and,
like, looking down.

175
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:02,579
Its arms and its legs are,
like, stretched thin.

176
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:07,282
It turns its head all the way
around to face the person.

177
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:13,253
It's almost like an image of a human face.

178
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,556
And I hear someone say, "Oh, my God.

179
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,292
"We're gonna die, aren't we?

180
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,228
This is going to kill us."

181
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:42,518
So, Beth,
I was talking to your husband, Sean.

182
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,986
He was telling me
everything that's happening.

183
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,490
That's got to be tough on you. I mean...
- Absolutely.

184
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:49,792
I mean, he believes that it's attacking him

185
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:52,396
and that it could actually kill him.

186
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,165
I know there's something there,
but I just can't see it.

187
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,632
Now, what about yourself?

188
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,668
Have you ever experienced
anything in the house?

189
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,638
Yeah, one time,
I was getting ready to go in the shower,

190
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,643
and all of a sudden, I hear the door,

191
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,646
and it's, like, shaking.

192
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,649
So I open the door,
and there's nobody there.

193
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:09,252
So I yell. I'm like, "Sean!"

194
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,387
So he's like, "What, what? What's going on?"

195
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,790
I'm like, "Watch. Don't touch the door."

196
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:16,060
And we waited, and then all of a sudden,

197
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,098
the door just started shaking
all again all by itself.

198
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,666
- In front of the both of you?
- Yeah.

199
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,969
- Okay, it wasn't a heavy truck going
by down the road that... - Nope. No.

200
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,943
- ...caused that?
- No. It was scary.

201
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:27,112
Up until now,
I thought whatever's going on here

202
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:29,413
was brought on by Sean's stress.

203
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:30,780
But speaking with his wife,

204
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:33,613
I get the feeling the activity
here isn't in his head.

205
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,248
So psychologically,
that's got to be taking a toll on yourself.

206
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,649
Mm-hmm.

207
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,318
I try to keep it together, but it's hard.

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,453
It's very stressful on the family.

209
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,654
How are you dealing with it?

210
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,823
We try, but the tension in the house

211
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,127
sometimes gets really crazy.

212
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:58,106
I think this thing...

213
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:02,878
it creates a very hostile
and negative environment.

214
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,851
Whatever's going on within this family

215
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:13,857
is a direct result of its influence.

216
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:17,792
They're just always, all of them,

217
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:21,064
functioning out of anger or fear,

218
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,305
hating on each other, basically.

219
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:28,739
It's also making them do things...

220
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:30,775
that they normally wouldn't do.

221
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,677
Divide and conquer.

222
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,678
That's kind of, I think,
what it's doing here.

223
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,654
Rebecca, I was talking to Mom, Dad.

224
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:47,121
There seems to be a lot of
stuff going on in the house.

225
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,454
Let me ask you a question...
How old are you?

226
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,890
- 13.
- Are you afraid to be here?

227
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:55,394
Yeah, there's noises,
knocking, stuff like that.

228
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,995
Explain it to me. What are you hearing?

229
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,063
I'll wake up, and I'll feel like

230
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,733
someone's standing in the doorway,

231
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,700
and they're just staring at me, like...

232
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:03,801
I'll run to my grandma's room sometimes.

233
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,872
- You will?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,573
- Are you close with your parents?
- Not really.

235
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,509
Yeah.

236
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,509
Okay.

237
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,777
What bothers you?

238
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,612
Why are you crying? Tell me.

239
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:18,614
'Cause it just
annoys me how my dad is so sick,

240
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,149
and no one can figure out why.

241
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:22,818
It seems like this is bothering you

242
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,887
- a lot more than you're telling people, right?
- Yes.

243
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,356
I will never stay here alone.

244
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:36,634
There's this kid.

245
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:40,442
She's got long, brown hair, brown eyes.

246
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,477
Maybe a teenager.

247
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,779
She's very angry.

248
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:47,648
I'm seeing a direct
interaction with a child...

249
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,483
a female child...

250
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,486
and this...thing.

251
00:12:55,256 --> 00:13:00,629
They're telling her what
they can do to her parents.

252
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,997
And then this thing can come, and it says,

253
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,196
"Hey.

254
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,427
You want me to take care of them for you?"

255
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,663
It's saying,

256
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:13,866
"I take the souls of the
ones who damn themselves."

257
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,705
So, Wilma, I was talking to your son,

258
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:24,609
and he's going through a lot here.

259
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,776
Oh, really a lot. We almost lost him.

260
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,013
Every part of his body is being attacked,

261
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:31,948
and nobody knows why.

262
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,918
It's that...

263
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,424
- It's hard to talk about, huh?
- Yeah.

264
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:39,458
I'm so glad you're here.

265
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,698
Yesterday, the house was very quiet.

266
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,134
They were all out, except me,

267
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:49,406
and I got up and I walked around.

268
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,207
You know how you can feel
someone staring at you

269
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,878
but there's no one there?

270
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,014
And I challenged it, and I told him.

271
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:00,182
I said, "I'm old,
but I'll do whatever you want me to do,

272
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,051
but leave my son alone."

273
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:05,987
And I said, "We believe in God,
and I'm not afraid of you."

274
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:08,923
And when you say "him,"
what are we talking about?

275
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,124
I think it's a man.

276
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,726
And it's very evil.

277
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:14,793
- I have seen it.
- What do you see?

278
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:18,261
I told Sean
and he drew a picture.

279
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,030
And I have it here. Let me see.

280
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,733
Sean drew this.

281
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:27,303
Okay, but have you seen this thing?

282
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,643
I believe that is the shadow figure

283
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,313
that came down the hallway.

284
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,515
I had gone to bed,

285
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:35,584
and I saw a shadow,

286
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:38,355
and I'm saying, "Oh, please go away.
Please go away."

287
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:44,126
And then I could hear

288
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,560
And the air was coming on my neck.

289
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:48,762
It was so cold.

290
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,065
And I
just wanted it to go away.

291
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,032
I said, "Please,"
'cause little Derek was next to me.

292
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,898
And I was saying,
"Please don't hurt the baby."

293
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,370
- I'm sorry.
- No.

294
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,970
Here. Take that.

295
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,777
Now, have you ever seen
any other apparitions?

296
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,146
I see children in this room.

297
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,047
How many kids are you seeing?

298
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,449
- Three.
- Three.

299
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:18,152
The girl and the boy and the older one.

300
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:19,553
Okay.

301
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:23,587
You can hear walking and
whispering and giggling.

302
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,891
I don't let the kids go far from me.

303
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,194
I don't even know...
could they take them or not?

304
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,834
Like, I just see dirt,

305
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:38,404
blood, dead bodies.

306
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,875
These are the damned.
These are the lost ones.

307
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:44,013
There is a lot of them.

308
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:47,519
They make a lot of noise.

309
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,989
And I feel like...

310
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,930
...people around see them.

311
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:02,270
I just see a bunch of dead people,

312
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:05,975
like, coming in through the wall

313
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:12,381
and just... being in this area.

314
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:15,750
And there's, like,

315
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:20,489
something inside of the bed in the mattress

316
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,324
kind of scaring people.

317
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:26,558
They just follow this thing.

318
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,727
He...has them.

319
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,932
I believe that this thing
caused their downfalls.

320
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,500
What does it want with the living?

321
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,770
For them to run their lives into the ground,

322
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:45,475
to do bad things to
themselves and other people,

323
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,178
to damn themselves.

324
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,333
Sean told me he thought

325
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,203
his property was once Native American land.

326
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:07,538
Now, when clients tell
me this kind of stuff,

327
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,008
I take it with a grain of salt.

328
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,812
But I called a local author,
and he said Sean's right

329
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,113
and that he has information
that might help my case.

330
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,126
Well, Dr. Frazier,
thanks for meeting with me.

331
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,759
- I appreciate that.
- Gladly.

332
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,660
So you mentioned on the
phone my client was right.

333
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:30,363
He thought that his property
was once Native American land.

334
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,532
Absolutely.

335
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,533
I mean, this place was a transit point

336
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,437
for a lot of different
tribes over the years,

337
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,308
- not just one.
- Okay.

338
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,377
But the Jumanos occupied this land

339
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,212
when the Spanish first show up.

340
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:45,250
So they were here until
probably about the early 1700s.

341
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:48,352
Early 1700s, Plains Apaches then come in

342
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:52,892
- and displace the largely pedestrian Jumanos.
- Wow.

343
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,792
I've never heard of Indians
displacing each other.

344
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,325
This was a blood feud.

345
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,760
So how bloody of a battle
are we talking about?

346
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:00,930
If you're a fallen warrior,

347
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,062
you can expect to have
your corpse mutilated.

348
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:06,133
They'd cut off hands, cut off fingers.

349
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,701
- Really?
- Very brutal.

350
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:11,071
And then, the Apaches are
driven out by the Comanches.

351
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,106
Goes for 100 years.

352
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,609
So we're talking from the mid 1700s?

353
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,645
Yeah, all the way into
the early 19th century.

354
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:20,448
I mean, they fought the
Apaches hammer and tongs.

355
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,654
I mean, they never gave
up fighting the Apaches

356
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,889
- until the very, very end.
- Geez.

357
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:28,193
They scalped people.
They'd eat livers sometimes.

358
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:31,330
If they could make you
scream or beg for mercy,

359
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,599
that's the ultimate power.

360
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:34,832
These guys sound like

361
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,465
- not somebody you want to mess with.
- Right.

362
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,095
How do the white settlers
wind up dealing with it?

363
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,431
Well, the settlers were on the losing end

364
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,900
for several decades.

365
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:44,533
I mean, really,
the Comanches ruled the roost out here

366
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:48,074
from about 1770 to about 1870.

367
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:53,611
There is a lot of anonymous
dying in this part of the world.

368
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,589
There's a lot of panic.

369
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:03,862
This old dude is talking.

370
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:08,395
He's, like, saying,
"There's all of these wars that happened."

371
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,735
And he's talking about the Native Americans.

372
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,336
Well, like, with the Native Amer...

373
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,339
I just see them, like, fighting.

374
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,707
And then I just see them dead.

375
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,875
I see their blood on the ground.

376
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,179
There's other people later.

377
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,649
So I keep seeing, like,

378
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,418
different groups of people over time,

379
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,354
and they're just dead on the ground,
bleeding.

380
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:36,056
So what I'm thinking

381
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,658
is that this thing...

382
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,662
is causing... causing it.

383
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:45,497
It's, like, instigating and fueling it.

384
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,728
Yes. Yes.

385
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,662
Now, Dr. Frazier, do you have any idea

386
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,397
who the original white settler was

387
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,864
on the property I'm investigating?

388
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:56,501
John Hunter Herndon.
This is a picture of him.

389
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:59,406
- Where's he from?
- He's a Kentuckian.

390
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:03,774
And he's like so many Southerners.

391
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:06,878
He's looking to establish some
sort of agricultural empire

392
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,346
in Texas in the 1830s, '40s, and '50s.

393
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:12,749
And he comes to Texas to make his fortune.

394
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,150
He's carrying some bank with him.

395
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:17,254
- He's coming for money, hunting for money.
- Okay.

396
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,657
His main businesses were
down on the Texas coast.

397
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,626
That's where his plantations were.

398
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:23,295
That's where his slaves were.

399
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,599
That's where his entire
economic enterprise was.

400
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,900
So when we...
how many slaves did this guy have?

401
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,903
- Do we have any idea?
- Yeah, low hundreds.

402
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,138
Hundreds?

403
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,474
And everything is really
on the climb for him,

404
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:37,944
- but he bets big on the Confederacy.
- Oh.

405
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:42,015
And, as you know,
the Confederates came in 2nd.

406
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,517
So his money was all in Confederate money,
I guess.

407
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,918
Correct. Correct.

408
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,989
His slaves were emancipated,
and so at the end of his life...

409
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,592
I mean, here's his obituary.

410
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:53,127
At the end of his life,
he ends up essentially getting ruined.

411
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,630
He gambled and lost.

412
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,966
So, do we know what he died of?

413
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:59,970
Probably died of a broken heart,
if you ask me.

414
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,710
There's one thing that controls all.

415
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:11,214
It already took down those people outside.

416
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,348
I just keep hearing bad decisions.

417
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,583
The thing that caused the issues here...

418
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:20,287
this main nasty thing... makes people crazy.

419
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,710
Now that I know my client's property

420
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,713
was the site of a brutal Native American war

421
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,947
and owned by a wealthy plantation owner,

422
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:43,284
I need to see if there's anything else.

423
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,289
Searching through the archives,

424
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,288
I find a man named Otto Steffens,

425
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,957
who lived on Sean's land.

426
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,462
Turns out he was one of
Abilene's first millionaires.

427
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:05,274
I actually managed to track
down one of his descendants.

428
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:06,578
He tells me the second

429
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,014
Otto Steffens landed on
my client's property,

430
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,981
his life spiraled out of control.

431
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,989
Clinton, thanks for meeting with me.
I appreciate that.

432
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,257
Now, I understand the
property I'm investigating...

433
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,596
your great grandfather owned
that property at one point.

434
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,965
- Right.
- Okay, now, what do you know about him?

435
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:31,703
He moved to Texas with
his folks around 1851.

436
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:33,770
- Okay, from where?
- Germany.

437
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,171
He was the epitome of the American dream.

438
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,739
So how does he wind up coming to Abilene?

439
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:42,645
He buys a bank from a man named Louding.

440
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:43,814
Okay.

441
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:46,922
- And do we know when that was?
- 1883.

442
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:48,992
Then he moves to Abilene.

443
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,895
In fact, this is pretty close

444
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:53,364
to what he would have
looked like about that time.

445
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:57,268
That's Otto Steffens.

446
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,505
He buys a parcel of land.

447
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:03,446
This is the parcel of
land in blue right here.

448
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,749
Do you know where my client's
property would be right now?

449
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:10,321
Your client's property is right here.

450
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,956
- Where this dot is?
- Where the dot is.

451
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,724
You mentioned on the phone
that things went bad for him.

452
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,993
What did you mean by that?

453
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,934
He became president of the
Abilene Fire Department,

454
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:22,938
and the first fire they
went to was his house.

455
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,410
They set up a pumper truck,
and it failed to work.

456
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:28,945
And so the house burned down.

457
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:32,648
So you weren't kidding
about his luck changing.

458
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,584
No, it went from there even to worse
'cause in 1905,

459
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:39,253
there was a failure with the bank.

460
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,322
The federal government came in

461
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:43,857
and pressed charges against
him for embezzlement.

462
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,229
He was convicted on three charges.

463
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,698
Louding was convicted on 18 charges.

464
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,771
Now, during the appeals,

465
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:58,844
Walter, his son, committed suicide...

466
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:01,416
shot himself.

467
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:05,186
So now the son commits suicide.
He's under indictment.

468
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:06,888
What happens with him?

469
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,889
Otto, with the stress of the trials,

470
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:12,860
had a heart attack and died.

471
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:14,863
And how old was he when he died?

472
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,564
- He was 56.
- He was a young man.

473
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:20,237
He was a pillar of the
community as an empire builder.

474
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:24,308
And all of a sudden,
everything just went down the tubes.

475
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:31,516
Do you know what this thing is?

476
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,386
I know what it's not,

477
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,655
and it's not a devil and it's not a demon.

478
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,158
Was it ever a human?

479
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,061
I don't think so.

480
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:47,570
I can't talk about what it is right now.

481
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,004
Why?

482
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:50,771
'Cause I'm trying to protect myself.

483
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,873
People worship it.

484
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:57,679
If you use its name, it's like a summoning.

485
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,519
During my research,
I noticed something strange.

486
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,921
There seemed to be an
unusual amount of murders

487
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,490
surrounding my client's property.

488
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:10,392
Now, it's a small town, so it seems odd.

489
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:13,463
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police sergeant

490
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,797
who actually worked on
a couple of those cases.

491
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,196
You mentioned on the
phone you actually worked

492
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:27,298
- on a couple of the cases that I came across.
- I did.

493
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,401
What can you tell me about the first one?

494
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,771
The first one was the
murder of Geneva Jackson.

495
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,073
Happened in '73.

496
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,645
She was a schoolteacher for
the Abilene School District.

497
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,514
Her body was found the 15th of December

498
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,215
about 3/10 of a mile

499
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:44,114
from the location that
y'all are investigating.

500
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:47,221
I did come across that.
It's in one of my articles here.

501
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:49,291
Okay, what happened with this case?

502
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,626
Some friends found her in her bathtub.

503
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,228
She'd actually drowned,

504
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,066
but she'd also been stabbed multiple times.

505
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:56,700
And is that an open case?

506
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,633
- It's still open, yes.
- What else did you find?

507
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,201
There was another one about
a little over a mile away

508
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,006
that was a murder-suicide that happened

509
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:04,873
where a married couple

510
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,908
had had a domestic disturbance
at a local restaurant

511
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,310
over some marital issues.

512
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:11,181
Then when she returned home

513
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,454
after getting off her
shift at the restaurant,

514
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:15,122
he was waiting for her.

515
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:18,623
Shot her eight times
and then killed himself.

516
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,193
Any kids in the house, anything like that?

517
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,698
They did have children
arriving home from school

518
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,266
- about the time that this happened.
- Oh, geez.

519
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:26,770
Okay, so now we've got an unsolved murder

520
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:28,272
and then a murder-suicide

521
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,941
real close to the property
I'm investigating.

522
00:26:29,943 --> 00:26:32,377
And there's a third one I think
might be of interest to you...

523
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:34,546
a suicide from just about a block away.

524
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,281
- A block away.
- Right.

525
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:39,416
36-year-old woman in 1975

526
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:42,422
committed suicide with a.22 rifle.

527
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,821
Left behind four kids in that case.

528
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:46,688
Was there any reason why?

529
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,689
- Was there a note left? Anything like that?
- No.

530
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,802
I saw several entities during my walk,

531
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:03,604
but one is responsible for most
of the trouble in my house,

532
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:06,006
and I got a good look at
it in one of the bedrooms.

533
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:09,343
The child was in a bed.

534
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:13,649
There was an entity that
was above the child.

535
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,652
It's, like, hanging from the ceiling,

536
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:20,288
and it has, like,
human eyes and a human mouth.

537
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,026
This entity... is
he rather transparent?

538
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:25,496
No, he's black.

539
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:28,230
Is this what you saw?

540
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:29,830
Yes.

541
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,044
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

542
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,144
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

543
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,814
and our clients for the first time.

544
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:00,547
Amy, I'd like you to meet Sean,

545
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:03,746
his wife, Beth, and this is his mom, Wilma.

546
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,918
They all live here in this house

547
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,854
with Sean and Beth's five kids.

548
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,124
- They range from 18 to 21/2?
- Correct.

549
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,025
Sean's an Air Force veteran.

550
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,726
He's done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

551
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,495
So this guy knows what danger's all about.

552
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,531
When he called me and he said
this house was killing him,

553
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,767
I knew we had to come and help
out and see what was going on.

554
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,501
Now that Amy knows

555
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,638
a little bit about what
this situation is here,

556
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,441
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

557
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:37,449
When I got here,
there was this little, old man,

558
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:40,654
and he was telling me

559
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:43,524
there was a lot of fighting here, or wars.

560
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:46,695
There were several different
ones over many years.

561
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:50,702
It seemed, to me,
to start with the Native American issue,

562
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:54,107
and there were all of these bodies.

563
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:59,210
And these were all of the people
who had died over the years.

564
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:01,377
Now...

565
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:03,212
you had thought this was Native
American land at one point.

566
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:05,346
- Correct.
- You were 100% right.

567
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:08,081
The original Native Americans
here were called the Jumanos.

568
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,250
And this is going back to the 1700s.

569
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:13,721
But the Apaches decided that
they wanted to live here,

570
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:15,389
and they attacked.

571
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:17,391
And after the Apaches settled here,

572
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:19,122
the Comanches decided they wanted this area.

573
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,360
- Oh, man.
- So they came in,

574
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:25,968
and the warring was going
on for over 100 years.

575
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,769
They were pretty brutal.

576
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:29,372
These guys were scalping each other.

577
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:32,042
Then they'd eat their livers on some of them

578
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:34,046
and dismembered them.

579
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:37,016
A lot of people got killed on this property.

580
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:45,295
I saw a lot of the dead
people outside the house,

581
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:49,266
and I saw a lot of dead
people inside the house.

582
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:52,403
Specifically,
I saw them in the master bedroom.

583
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:54,840
I saw them coming through that wall.

584
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:56,775
And some of them, actually,

585
00:29:56,777 --> 00:30:01,642
would get inside of the
mattress and be in the bed.

586
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:03,979
These people were the damned.

587
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,647
You can hear them.

588
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,950
You know, like,
I can hear them outside in the front yard.

589
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:11,152
You go look. There's nobody there.

590
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,888
You hear them in here,
like there's people here.

591
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,523
Nobody here.

592
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:17,193
So this is, like, the kind of stuff they do.

593
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:19,494
There are a lot of times

594
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:22,796
that I'll go in that master bedroom,
and I'm there

595
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,197
and you just feel like your
life is being sucked from you.

596
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,799
And I feel like there's people
just standing around me.

597
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,198
Like, they're just standing there.

598
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,599
Well, they are.

599
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:41,542
Everything that's been going on,
everything that's here,

600
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:44,247
all of the people still being here

601
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:46,615
from these wars and fights

602
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:49,816
goes back to a single entity.

603
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:52,753
And I'm referring to it as "The Dark One."

604
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,256
What it does is it pushes people

605
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,926
into basically damning themselves.

606
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:03,294
This, to me,
is definitely the biggest issue.

607
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,631
This Dark One affects you in many ways.

608
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,735
One way is psychological.

609
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:12,740
I got that it creates obsessive thoughts,

610
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,410
promotes negativity,

611
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,246
a lot of tension, a lot of fighting.

612
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:18,316
It feeds off of that.

613
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:21,787
In the master bedroom,
I heard, "Divide and conquer,"

614
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:23,723
and that's what it's
trying to do to the family.

615
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:26,160
You're being manipulated,

616
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:27,929
and you're being influenced

617
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,464
to create, you know, bad decisions.

618
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:36,127
You guys have been fighting,
right, a little bit?

619
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,860
A lot.

620
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,493
Like, you just hit the nail on the head.

621
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:44,596
I mean, every member in our family fights.

622
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,267
It's just completely tense.

623
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,270
Also, we make a decision,
and then we find out,

624
00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:53,905
like, "What were we thinking?"

625
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:55,940
Mm-hmm.

626
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:57,409
It's funny you say that because

627
00:31:57,411 --> 00:32:00,645
this land has had a history of that.

628
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:02,547
People that wouldn't
normally make bad decisions

629
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,050
making bad decisions.

630
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:06,921
One of the original settlers
that bought your track of land

631
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,421
was this guy Otto Steffens.

632
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:11,421
You see what I have highlighted in blue?

633
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:13,724
This is the track of land that he bought.

634
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,163
That dot's your house.

635
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:17,898
This is him here.

636
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,098
He's a self-made guy, successful.

637
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,240
Now, Otto was doing really
well till he came to Abilene

638
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,676
and hooked up with this guy, Louding.

639
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,179
And they opened up a bank together.

640
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,052
Things started going downhill from there.

641
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:35,186
His home burned down to the ground.

642
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,388
1905... the bank failed,

643
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,724
and then the federal government came in

644
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,426
and they investigated him.

645
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,263
He got hit up with embezzlement charges

646
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:44,699
and all kind of bank fraud.

647
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,267
So they went to trial.

648
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,569
And after the first conviction,

649
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:51,737
this guy's son went to Fort
Worth and killed himself.

650
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:55,540
Two more trials later,

651
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,709
appeal after appeal,
he winds up having a heart attack.

652
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:00,911
He was only 56 when he died.

653
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:03,079
Now, another guy that made a bad decision

654
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,681
was this guy John Herndon,

655
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,949
who was actually here before Steffens.

656
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,951
This is him right here.

657
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,988
He's a land speculator,
basically, in this area.

658
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,856
Well-to-do guy from Kentucky,
came from money,

659
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:17,725
made great business decisions.

660
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,261
But the bad decision this guy made was

661
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,628
he put everything he had
into the Confederacy.

662
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,496
Well, he lost everything.

663
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,165
He wound up dying broke and alone.

664
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:32,472
How are you guys like as far
as the bad decision making?

665
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:34,207
We have a lot of debt.

666
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,743
Right.

667
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:38,146
And then with the obsessive thoughts?

668
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,682
- That's a big one for me.
- Yeah?

669
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:43,518
I am OCD crazy with a lot of things.

670
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,388
Not<i> you.</i>

671
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,259
You're being influenced by outside forces.

672
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,868
How else is this thing affecting them?

673
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,971
It's also physical.

674
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,307
When I was in the office,

675
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:02,279
I actually saw a female sitting there.

676
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:05,183
She could feel sharp pain in her neck,

677
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:07,418
like all in this area.

678
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,654
Wilma, tell them about the
thing with your neck.

679
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,791
I was laying on my side in my bed.

680
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,658
I happened to get a glance.

681
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,761
It was a black figure.

682
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,901
And I came down the hallway,

683
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:23,173
and I could tell that it was bad.

684
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:26,106
He touched my neck.

685
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,274
It was so cold.

686
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,810
- Yeah.
- So cold.

687
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:32,782
And then he started breathing.

688
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,324
And the air was so, so cold

689
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,892
that my whole shoulder and
my neck was just frozen.

690
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:44,230
When I woke up in the morning,

691
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,768
here on this side and here was red.

692
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,168
Well, this thing is completely capable

693
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,068
of doing this, you know.

694
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,976
And did you get anything
else from this thing?

695
00:34:55,978 --> 00:35:00,280
It does cause illnesses, muscular problems,

696
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:01,749
stomach issues,

697
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:05,951
breathing issues, and chest issues.

698
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:11,393
Well, that's the main reason we're here.

699
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:14,392
Now, Sean's 38 years old, okay?

700
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:16,862
This is what he looked like
only a couple of years ago.

701
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,904
What? What happened?

702
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:22,771
I had a stroke,

703
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,907
and then I had a massive pulmonary
embolism with multiple clots.

704
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:28,811
And then from then, I have diabetes,

705
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:31,583
heart problems, liver problems.

706
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:34,222
I've gone to doctors.

707
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:36,060
Nobody can tell me why.

708
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:37,731
Oh, my gosh.

709
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,668
And that's why he thinks that
this house is killing him.

710
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:47,544
Unfortunately, one of the things that I saw

711
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,511
is that it specifically is interacting

712
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:55,750
with a child between the age of 9 and 12.

713
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,752
She did have her hair back.

714
00:35:59,754 --> 00:36:02,721
It was brown, like, in a ponytail, long-ish.

715
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:05,989
Her and this thing have bonded,

716
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:08,326
so it's manipulated her

717
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:11,795
into thinking that it's friendly.

718
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,297
She's able to hear it.

719
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,232
She's able to see it.

720
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:20,138
Whenever she gets into fights
or she gets in trouble,

721
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,709
this thing is like,

722
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:27,048
"I'll take care of it. I'll punish them."

723
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,850
The only one that sounds like is Rebecca.

724
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,921
I think she has abilities.

725
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:40,995
Becca and I... we clash a lot.

726
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:43,566
I'm stunned. Just...

727
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,002
I did do a sketch of The Dark One

728
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:49,572
when I saw it in the child's room.

729
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:54,479
What the [Bleep]

730
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:02,760
Wow.

731
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:19,482
I did do a sketch of The Dark One

732
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:22,916
when I saw it in the child's room.

733
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,889
What the [Bleep]

734
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:35,730
Wow.

735
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,240
Is it okay if I show her what you gave me?

736
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:44,808
Mm-hmm.

737
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,847
This is a sketch he did for what he saw.

738
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,382
Okay.

739
00:37:56,492 --> 00:38:00,428
Oh, yeah.

740
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,999
Mm-hmm.

741
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:04,103
What is it, and what does it want?

742
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:06,705
This is where it gets <i>really</i> strange.

743
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:10,209
I knew it wasn't a devil
and it wasn't a demon.

744
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:15,475
I am calling it "The Dark One"
because I can't say its name

745
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:18,443
because that could put me in danger.

746
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:24,374
This particular being is native to Africa.

747
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:27,008
It's utilized in the voodoo tradition.

748
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:33,576
Usually, how this entity comes into being

749
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:37,513
is that a voodoo practitioner
will do a summoning.

750
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,579
And the entity

751
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:43,284
will then form a direct
attachment to the summoner.

752
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:46,453
It will always be with that person,

753
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:49,358
okay, for their entire life.

754
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,131
And the family, then,
can inherit this entity.

755
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:57,838
You have to honor it and respect it,

756
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,439
and if you don't,

757
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:02,943
it becomes very volatile, very destructive.

758
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,881
So I'm very confused

759
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:11,620
because this one seems to have gone rogue.

760
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:12,988
And that was one of my questions...

761
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,856
you know,
were there slaves ever in the area?

762
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:16,124
Well, this guy John Herndon

763
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:17,991
owned the property here at one time,

764
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:20,093
- and he had over 100 slaves.
- Yeah, I think this thing...

765
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:23,029
it had to have been more...

766
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:27,827
I think directly, you know, somehow here.

767
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,332
So how it got here I think
is gonna remain a mystery,

768
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:35,699
but I know what I saw,
and I know what it is.

769
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:38,734
And I know what it's doing. It terrified me.

770
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:41,637
I knew, you know,
that things were happening,

771
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,097
and I knew it was bad.

772
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:48,745
I told him, "I'm old," you know,
"to leave my family alone."

773
00:39:48,747 --> 00:39:51,549
So what does it want to do to our client?

774
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,585
It wants to cause destruction and mayhem

775
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:58,156
and cause them to, you know,
destroy themselves.

776
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:04,731
Well, Sean,
you served your country in two wars.

777
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,666
You came home to another war.

778
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:11,338
My question is is this a war
or a battle that you can win,

779
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,907
and can your family live here
safely and normally once again?

780
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:18,878
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

781
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,514
I'm extremely, extremely worried.

782
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:25,117
I want you to bring in a voodoo priest.

783
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,292
I want the entire family to
go through a ritual with him

784
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:32,827
where he can protect you

785
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:37,099
and remove any attachments that may exist.

786
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:42,340
Now, you'll be protected
from this thing forever.

787
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:45,675
The problem is anyone who's not there

788
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,677
having this ritual done

789
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,612
is going to be subjected to this entity.

790
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:57,716
Any friends you have over,
any family you have over,

791
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:01,320
this thing's gonna be
gunning for them big time.

792
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:04,986
There's no way we can get rid of it?

793
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:07,353
You might be able to knock
it out and take care of it.

794
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:09,220
We can have hope.

795
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:12,954
But if he doesn't,
you're gonna have to move.

796
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:17,394
So when the voodoo priest does this ritual,

797
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:19,360
will it help the dead people that are here?

798
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:21,165
Yes.

799
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,436
They're attached to The Dark One.

800
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,604
When it's gone, will they just go?

801
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,574
Oh, yes, they're gonna be set free.

802
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:30,112
I believe it's intelligent.

803
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,611
I mean, it knows what's going on.

804
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:33,615
It knows what we're doing.

805
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,452
It's preparing for... war.

806
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:40,220
So here's the million-dollar question...

807
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,189
are you gonna be vigilant
and do this or what?

808
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:43,757
- Definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

809
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,724
Well, I feel a little bit better

810
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:48,861
that there's some hope
at the end of the tunnel.

811
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:49,862
Right.

812
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,429
Wilma, are you on board?

813
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,533
It's life or death.
I mean, that's what I think.

814
00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:58,566
Sean and his family

815
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:01,132
have an extremely difficult
fight ahead of them.

816
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:04,070
Contacting the voodoo
priest is their only chance

817
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:06,005
of ridding themselves of The Dark One,

818
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,875
whose sights are set on destroying them.
