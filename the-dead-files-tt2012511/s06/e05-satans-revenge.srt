1
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,377
There's up to 50 dead people down in here.

2
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,015
I wake up with my heart racing,
scared to death.

3
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,418
That creature... I don't think it's good.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,421
For a small town, it was scandalous.

5
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:28,191
He's like, "I just want to make them bleed."

6
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:31,328
I don't like it at all,
and I want it to stop.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,930
What are they doing down here?

8
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:36,867
This place is, like, insane.

9
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:40,093
"You're mine. You can't escape."

10
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:43,394
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,429
What's happening?

12
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:46,530
I see dead people.

13
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,966
It seems like a devil.

14
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:50,701
I speak to dead people.

15
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:52,336
He's pissed off.

16
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,771
And they speak to me.

17
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:55,939
I felt real fear.

18
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,909
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

19
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,477
I think she's being murdered.

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,479
I rely on my partner.

21
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,747
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

22
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,783
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

23
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,518
Serial killer pops in my head.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,088
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,290
Nobody believes me.

26
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,757
It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,027
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

28
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,761
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,796
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:20,998
Until the very end.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,866
You got problems. I got news for you.

32
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:24,968
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,038
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,305
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:31,051
This is their house, the house of the dead.

36
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:52,296
I'm in the small town of Leslie, Michigan,

37
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:54,398
about a half-hour outside of Lansing.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,268
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Michelle.

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,504
Now, she told me on the phone
that whatever's in the house

40
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,606
is attacking her and her daughter.

41
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,944
She begged me to rush over

42
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:09,347
because she thinks she's
running out of time.

43
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:22,293
Before Amy arrives,

44
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:25,162
I do a complete sweep of the house.

45
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:29,466
What's common in most homes,
like family photographs,

46
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:32,369
can influence her findings.

47
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,940
So it's important I remove them
all before she begins her walk.

48
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,193
Oh, boy.

49
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,432
The living people here...

50
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,435
It feels like they're, like,
weighted, weighted down

51
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:08,105
because there's too much...

52
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,007
death here.

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,247
This house is just really dark,

54
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:18,615
really bad with crazy,

55
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:22,553
with people acting out
and doing bad things.

56
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:26,189
It's not...

57
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,225
It's not good.

58
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,701
Michelle, I'm glad I'm here,

59
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,836
'cause you sounded really
concerned on the phone

60
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,138
about what's happening.

61
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,174
Things have been going on
in this house for years.

62
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,109
We've seen apparitions.

63
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,213
We hear footsteps.
Then the last couple years,

64
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:52,883
it has become extremely physical.

65
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,085
It's attacking my daughter and I,

66
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:58,522
scratching us, leaving bruises.

67
00:03:58,524 --> 00:03:59,790
Wow.

68
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,225
Who lives in the house, exactly?

69
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:05,729
My husband, my 16-year-old daughter,

70
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,898
and my 17-year-old son.

71
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,768
This is your daughter that's
being affected by this stuff?

72
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,703
Yes.

73
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:16,039
As a mother, it absolutely eats at my gut.

74
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,941
I would do anything to protect her,

75
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:20,511
but if you can't see something,

76
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,179
then how do you stop it from happening?

77
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,582
With all this going on,
how you dealing with it?

78
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,084
Well, we're not dealing with it well lately.

79
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:30,087
As soon as we walk into the house,
it's like a switch.

80
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,790
The mood will absolutely change.

81
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,492
You'll go from, you know,
being in a great mood

82
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,961
to being completely angry,

83
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:40,764
and I've definitely been sick a lot

84
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:43,066
since I've moved into this house.

85
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:44,701
What kind of sick we talking about?

86
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,137
My daughter and I both get
debilitating headaches,

87
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,373
and I've had several surgeries.

88
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,176
I've had shoulder surgery.
I've had a hysterectomy.

89
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,813
I lost a baby in this house.

90
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:58,782
Wow. I'm sorry to hear that.

91
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:02,519
This house is beautiful.
I mean, why don't you just move?

92
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,321
Somebody would buy it.

93
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,856
I love this house.

94
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,792
I've put my heart and soul into this house.

95
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,229
I've been praying for, you know,
when you guys get here

96
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:15,699
- that you're really able to help us.
- Okay.

97
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,306
Someone's panicking.

98
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:24,442
Um, there's a woman.

99
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:28,279
Living. She has long hair, brown.

100
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:32,215
She's got something wrong with her heart.

101
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,818
It's just...

102
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,154
a [bleep] mess, man.

103
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:40,557
She's so scared.

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,163
[Bleep] She can't breathe, man.

105
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,372
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

106
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:58,676
I have physically been
attacked in this room.

107
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,211
I receive scratches.

108
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:03,880
I actually have a picture
that I took last week.

109
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:08,752
Wow.

110
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,987
Do you remember scratching yourself at all?

111
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,825
No. And it's happened in
this room several times.

112
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,561
Geez. Amy's gonna want to see this.

113
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:20,163
You mind if I hold onto
this for a little bit?

114
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,565
- Sure.
- Okay.

115
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,934
Now,
do you have anything else going on in here?

116
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:28,205
I will hear footsteps
coming down the stairs,

117
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:31,675
and shortly after, a shadow will appear

118
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,978
walking down the stairways
over there to our basement.

119
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:40,384
I would describe it like a man,
but as a black mass.

120
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,785
I know it's taller than I am.

121
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,788
And you're not on medication
or anything like that?

122
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,824
No, I'm not on any medication.

123
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:49,059
You drink at night before you go to bed?

124
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,028
- No.
- Okay.

125
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,498
I wake up with my heart racing,
like, scared to death.

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,199
Okay.

127
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:02,205
Whoa.

128
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,307
What?

129
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,981
There's a really big shadow person here,

130
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:15,252
a shadow being. It doesn't even have a face.

131
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:19,523
Really tall, really...

132
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,523
big.

133
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:28,198
I don't like it. I-I don't think it's good.

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,134
It's, like...

135
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:35,138
trying to make me follow it up the stairs.

136
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:45,482
It's, like, crawling oddly down the hall.

137
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:52,022
And it's climbing the ceilings
and climbing the walls.

138
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:54,391
And it's like this on the ceiling.

139
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,026
You know what I'm saying?

140
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,863
Man, it gets...

141
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:03,166
It gets bad at night. It gets bad at night.

142
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,038
Thing, like, tortures her.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,407
No sleeping, no sleep.

144
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,285
So, what's going on up here?

145
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:24,622
I will see the shadow man

146
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:27,491
roll right across my ceiling over my bed.

147
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,927
Okay. Kind of like the shadow
guy you described downstairs?

148
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,564
- Exactly like that.
- That's bizarre.

149
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,333
Is anything else going on?

150
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:40,237
The other thing is,
I have repeated nightmares.

151
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:43,173
And when I wake up from these dreams,

152
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:49,412
I will have bruises on my thighs
in the shape of fingerprints.

153
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:54,852
You okay?

154
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,087
Um...

155
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,090
it just reminds me of the times

156
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,827
when I was sexually assaulted as a child.

157
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,996
I wasn't aware of that. Okay.

158
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:10,033
I was attacked in a very brutal manner.

159
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:13,370
I was chased around by a babysitter

160
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,406
who would strip naked,

161
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,075
and he would chase me around the house.

162
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:21,211
And most of the time,
I would hide under the bed

163
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,880
until he would drag me out by my ankles

164
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:28,318
and physically assault me, so...

165
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,989
I don't like it at all,
and I do want it to stop.

166
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:38,862
It's like you're reliving it, I know. Okay?

167
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:45,336
I told myself not to cry.

168
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:47,871
It's not easy to talk about.

169
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,076
How often did this happen
when you were younger?

170
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:54,378
This happen one time?

171
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,582
No, I was left with him
on several occasions.

172
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:01,451
This guy ever get arrested for this?

173
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,986
No, he did not.

174
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:06,457
He committed suicide as a teenager.

175
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,125
Okay. All right.

176
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,528
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,797
I know. It's gonna be all right.

178
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,001
You'll be okay.

179
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,940
Mm, this woman again...

180
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,179
Something happened to her.

181
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,949
What?

182
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:36,286
I don't know. Like, she was
physically abused or something.

183
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:39,322
And, like, because of that experience,

184
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:41,925
like, maybe she's just opened,

185
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,061
'cause this person has abilities.

186
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,337
There's, like, this creepy guy.

187
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,207
And this woman in particular...

188
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,411
She's aware that he does bad things.

189
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,979
Do you know when he's from?

190
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,884
Not that long ago.

191
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:11,454
He's focused on...

192
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,224
the suicide?

193
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:16,760
I think he killed himself,

194
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:21,097
and I think he would like to
make others kill themselves.

195
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,336
His endgame...

196
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:27,771
is death.

197
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,726
I was talking to your wife.

198
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,965
What your daughter and her
are both going through,

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,202
that would drive me to
want to shoot somebody.

200
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:58,205
I do. I do want to shoot somebody,

201
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,273
but there's nobody to shoot, Steve.

202
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,275
Have you had any experiences here?

203
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,745
Yeah. I was outside here with my son, Lucas,

204
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:06,710
building him something.

205
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,044
I put my circular saw down to my right.

206
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,713
And Luke's eyes opened up.

207
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:15,116
And at that point, I looked,
and the saw had levitated.

208
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,152
It went through my tennis shoes

209
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,722
and cut off my three middle toes.

210
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,791
- You're joking.
- No, sir.

211
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,492
You know, Dan, looking at this,

212
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,161
I've had friends that have
hurt themselves pretty bad,

213
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,297
and they never want to
admit they made a mistake.

214
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:32,700
I'd tell you if I made a mistake.
I've looked at it a million times.

215
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,836
I didn't place the saw down on my own foot.

216
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,538
Is it possible you dropped it down,

217
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,140
and it bounced off of something?

218
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,307
No, I set it down.

219
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,110
You set it down? Because I'm very cognizant

220
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,380
of this place and how people
have gotten hurt here.

221
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:49,551
We had the leading tile guy in
town cut his thumb off here.

222
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:52,386
Numerous contractors have
been hurt while working here.

223
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,493
This creepy guy...

224
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,133
He's like, "I just go in the ground,

225
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,235
and I just want to make them bleed."

226
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,173
He's very disturbed.

227
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,209
He creeps.

228
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,312
He's a creeper.

229
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:21,883
I see him, like,
coming up behind a living dude,

230
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,519
and then his head is, like,
right here, you know?

231
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,255
The dead dude's face is right here,

232
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,991
And he turns, you know?

233
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:32,294
And he's, like, whispering...

234
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:34,662
you know? And...

235
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:38,300
this gets inside the living dude's head.

236
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:39,868
He tells him what to do.

237
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,903
What does he tell him to do?

238
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,106
I think kill himself, you know?

239
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:52,446
Holy [bleep]

240
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,048
What?

241
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,485
There's probably up to 50
dead people down in here.

242
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,988
Who the [bleep]...
you know what I'm saying?

243
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,157
Has 50 [bleep] bad dead people

244
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,628
in their house in the middle of nowhere?

245
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:11,366
What are they doing down here?

246
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:18,406
Wow. Something's wrong with
these [bleep] people, man.

247
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,509
This place is, like, insane.

248
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,388
So, Shayna, I was talking to Mom,

249
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,624
and I really wanted to
sit down and talk to you,

250
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,658
'cause she told me

251
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,892
whatever's happening in the house

252
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,461
is happening to her<i> and</i> you.

253
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,029
- Mm-hmm. - So I just wanted to
hear from you what's going on.

254
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,266
I'm being scratched and bruised.

255
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:47,101
This just comes out of nowhere?

256
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,870
Yes, I wake up with it.

257
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,539
So, where else have you been scratched?

258
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,239
On my face.

259
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,476
- On your face?
- Yes, and I have a picture.

260
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,583
Wow. There's nothing sharp in
the bed or anything like that,

261
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:03,418
- like a zipper or anything, like...
- No.

262
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,853
A pillowcase or anything
that could've done this?

263
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,388
- No.
- Okay.

264
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,159
Now, what else is happening to you?

265
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,262
I see a shadow man in my room every night.

266
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:17,532
He can appear close to my bed,

267
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,368
but he's, like, this black figure,

268
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,172
and he's, like, tall,
and he's just pitch black.

269
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,541
He's darker than the night.

270
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,910
So, it sounds like you're
experiencing a lot.

271
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,278
- I mean, anything else happening?
- My door.

272
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,183
It's either the bathroom
door or my bedroom door.

273
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,719
I'll shut it,
and I'll lock it so I feel safer,

274
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,788
and it will shake it and pound on it

275
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,823
and try to get in. It'll push on it.

276
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:46,427
Sometimes, I wake up at night,
and it will be happening.

277
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:47,995
What do you think it is?

278
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:53,335
I think it's the spirit that
shows himself as a dark man.

279
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:56,671
- That's frightening stuff.
- Yeah.

280
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,843
The shadow thing tries to get in here,
but it can't.

281
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,412
When the door's closed, it can't get in.

282
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:07,214
Door's very important.

283
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,651
That creature...

284
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,386
- shadow...
- It's there?

285
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,821
Yeah, he's...

286
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,759
This is his area.
He likes it over there by the window.

287
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,864
There, he crumples up.

288
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:26,968
Like, he gets all hunched,
and he just... He waits, He waits.

289
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,040
Then he'll crawl out the
door and crawl down the hall,

290
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,809
you know, and go [bleep] with people.

291
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,580
He might be [bleep] crazy.

292
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,269
I don't doubt Michelle's
testimony for one minute,

293
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,705
but one thing that's nagging at me...

294
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:00,542
I'm wondering if the traumatic
event in her childhood

295
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,432
could be making her relive that nightmare

296
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,299
night after night after night.

297
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:07,402
It might not be paranormal at all.
Maybe it's psychological.

298
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,805
I'm heading over to meet with a psychologist

299
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,206
to see if that's possible.

300
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,647
Dr. Sivyer, thanks for meeting me.

301
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,016
I appreciate it.

302
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:25,187
So, I have a client who was
molested as a young child,

303
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,957
and she seems to be having
reoccurring nightmares

304
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,492
duplicating what happened to her.

305
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:33,561
- Okay.
- Is that common?

306
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:38,099
Generally speaking,
on post-traumatic stress disorder,

307
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:40,568
one of the things that can manifest

308
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,338
is called flashbacks,

309
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,507
where they're reliving the traumatic event

310
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,608
over and over again.

311
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,476
Okay. Now, here's the weird part.

312
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:52,881
She's actually waking up with
the bruising from an attack.

313
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:56,251
Individuals that suffer from
borderline personality disorder,

314
00:17:56,253 --> 00:18:00,488
they sometimes cut themselves
or bruise themselves.

315
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,558
What would I, as an investigator, look for

316
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,994
in a person to see if they're
that type of personality

317
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,629
to do that to themselves?

318
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:10,899
They have a hard time with their emotions.

319
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,935
They like a lot of attention
directed towards them.

320
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,371
Yeah, that doesn't describe this woman.

321
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,807
- She's the total opposite.
- Okay.

322
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,443
This is the weird part,
if you could help me out with this.

323
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,512
- She has a 16-year-old daughter...
- Okay.

324
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:27,082
Who's having the same type
of nightmares every night...

325
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:29,384
All right... same bruising.

326
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:32,454
It could be that her mom has explained

327
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:35,791
these events over and over again,

328
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,293
and they're seeing the same things.

329
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:41,997
Could those dreams possibly cause bruises?

330
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,967
There's no clinical
evidence that I'm aware of

331
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:50,472
that bruising and scratches
just manifest themselves.

332
00:18:54,877 --> 00:19:00,148
So, I'm seeing,
like, this living woman.

333
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,918
I feel like she feels like
she's losing her mind.

334
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,754
I want to say it's stress,

335
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,590
and I want to say it's due to her abilities.

336
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:14,162
But it's [bleep] her body up bad.

337
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:17,499
This might be what's affecting her heart.

338
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:21,302
It's debilitating.
It's becoming debilitating for her.

339
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,109
I'm confident that
Michelle and Shayna's bruises

340
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,276
are not self-inflicted,

341
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:30,145
so I need to look for an explanation

342
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,913
of what's going on in this house.

343
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:34,749
So I'm hitting the books
at the local library.

344
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,085
Searching old property records,

345
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,888
I find the original owner is
a man named Lafayette Peek.

346
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,092
Turns out,
he suffered a lot during his time,

347
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:47,128
losing three children
all under the age of 1.

348
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,867
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

349
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:54,169
who says those deaths

350
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,838
were just the beginning
of the family's tragedies.

351
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,812
Lafayette Peek and his wife, Harriet,

352
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:05,547
purchased the property in the 1860s.

353
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,749
And along with his brother, Theodore,

354
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,984
they ran an apple orchard.

355
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,152
And you can see their
property here at the top.

356
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:14,556
The three kids dying,
I guess that's not uncommon

357
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,958
back in those days,
but you say that was just the beginning

358
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
of his problems. What'd you mean by that?

359
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:21,196
In addition to Lafayette's children dying,
his brother,

360
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,365
Theodore, and his wife, Sally,
also had five children,

361
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,533
and they lost three of those children,
as well.

362
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,770
He does not take this very well.

363
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,839
He definitely had a mental
breakdown of some sort.

364
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,641
He was wandering through the streets.

365
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:37,478
He was shouting and screaming
and disturbing the neighbors.

366
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,348
His daughter filed a
petition with the court,

367
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,717
asking him to be declared insane

368
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,915
and committed to the
Kalamazoo State Hospital

369
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,081
for treatment.

370
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,026
What happened to him? Did he get committed?

371
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:51,808
He did not. So one of his
daughters petitioned the court

372
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,943
to, in fact, have him
released into her custody.

373
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,544
And so he went and lived with her

374
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,613
until he died of a stroke
several years later.

375
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:00,382
Well, that's kind of a sad
story for this guy...

376
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,452
all this death around him,
and then he goes crazy.

377
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:05,722
Unfortunately, that's not where it ends.

378
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,923
I also located several other individuals

379
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:10,959
related to the family,
but not necessarily by blood.

380
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,662
They were neighbors who had
various forms of mental illness.

381
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:16,159
That's odd. So it wasn't...

382
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:18,454
You know mental illness can
run in families, but...

383
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,520
It seems to have run in this neighborhood.

384
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:25,175
I see this man.

385
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:28,545
I think he lived here,
and I think he's mentally ill.

386
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:31,148
This person feels crazy.

387
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:37,087
This house...
It's caused people to go insane.

388
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:42,525
Oh, I'm getting really pissed. Aah.

389
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:47,364
This is a mess with the people here...

390
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:49,866
big-time mess.

391
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:07,819
During my research,

392
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,086
I came across something
else that caught my eye.

393
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,354
There was a huge legal battle

394
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,390
over Dan and Michelle's property.

395
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:15,391
And when I called a local historian,

396
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:18,028
he said it involved betrayal,
death, and insanity.

397
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,105
When I contacted you, you said there was

398
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:30,606
a lot more to the story.

399
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,342
It's quite an involved case.

400
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:34,511
The property was owned
by John and Maria Stitt,

401
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:38,114
and between the two of them,
they had a daughter named Rosa.

402
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,116
Okay.

403
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:43,453
Well, John was not the
most faithful of husbands.

404
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:45,822
And after about 20 years of marriage,

405
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,958
Maria had decided she had enough.

406
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,293
And in 1887, she filed for a divorce.

407
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:53,964
In that same year,
John is sued by one of his neighbors,

408
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:57,567
Albert Blackmore,
for alienating his wife's affections.

409
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:01,371
- So, he's going after this other guy's wife?
- He is.

410
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:03,006
Okay.

411
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,474
So, how's that work out?

412
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,409
They settle out of court financially.

413
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:09,746
And then he would marry
Elizabeth Blackmore,

414
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:14,918
And she has adopted an
African-American child

415
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,221
who's 14 years old by
the name of Etta Mecklin.

416
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:20,256
And it's not much time goes by,

417
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,258
then rumors are circulating

418
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,329
- that John is now having
affections for Etta... - Okay.

419
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,532
- The 14-year-old.
- This guy's a real piece of work.

420
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:33,036
And then his wife,
his current wife, Elizabeth,

421
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,107
in 1898, develops liver and breast cancer.

422
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,310
- Okay.
- She passes away in 1902,

423
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:43,380
so that leaves Etta and John in the home.

424
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:50,186
John passes away within a few
weeks of his wife's death,

425
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:53,623
and he's found in Etta's bed.

426
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,425
Here's an article.

427
00:23:55,427 --> 00:24:00,296
The big thing is,
John willed most of his estate to Etta.

428
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,866
Wow.

429
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,635
For a small town, it was scandalous.

430
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:06,736
What happens next?

431
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,905
This is where the lawsuit begins.

432
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:12,876
His biological daughter
really felt slighted...

433
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:15,812
- Okay...
- and contests the will.

434
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,948
Rosa felt that her father

435
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,116
was so overcome with passion for Etta

436
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:23,052
- that he rewrote his will.
- You had mentioned on the phone

437
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:25,188
there was a little bit of insanity.
I guess that came...

438
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,923
talking about him being under her influence?

439
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,393
- That's what it seems.
- Okay, so, how'd it work out?

440
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:33,763
Well, in the end, Etta won the case.

441
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,798
Really?

442
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,966
Rosa appealed this on two occasions

443
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,535
and lost on appeal both times.

444
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,775
This image I'm seeing
is really strange.

445
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:50,179
This is that weird [bleep]
creature thing...

446
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:54,383
crawling oddly down the hall.

447
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:59,122
Like, I don't know what this
[bleep] thing is, really.

448
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,423
I can't figure out

449
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:04,227
what this shadow creature
is or where it came from,

450
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:07,163
but I know that it's been
here for a very long time,

451
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,565
and its goal is to torment living people.

452
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,935
- Does it interact physically?
- Yes.

453
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:15,105
It makes people kind of [bleep] crazy.

454
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,083
I encountered many entities during my walk,

455
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:29,285
but two stood out the most...

456
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:30,453
first, the creepy guy

457
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:32,889
who's whispering to a
living man in the house.

458
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:35,158
It was in this room.

459
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,094
His eyes are kind of roundish.

460
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,564
Seemed to have lighter-colored hair.

461
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:43,433
And what about the second
person that you saw?

462
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:49,038
He had dark hair,
and he looked like a corpse.

463
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,273
Next, I described

464
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:53,476
the shadow creature
tormenting a living woman.

465
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:57,313
She had long hair. Late 30s or early 40s.

466
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,883
And there's this thing in the hallway.

467
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:05,588
Its skin is really smooth,
a gray/brown kind of color.

468
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,558
Coming down the hallway,
it actually had to be on all fours,

469
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,194
because it's so large.

470
00:26:13,297 --> 00:26:14,831
Amy, is this what you saw?

471
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,034
Yes.

472
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,519
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

473
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:42,820
we're ready to reveal our findings

474
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,137
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

475
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,704
Amy, I'd like you to meet Dan and Michelle.

476
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,306
This is their home.

477
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,242
They're raising their two children here.

478
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,145
This is Lucas, who's 17.
This is Shayna, who's 16.

479
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,848
Now, things are pretty bad here

480
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,783
because Michelle and Shayna

481
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,586
are being physically
and emotionally attacked

482
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,388
every night.

483
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,590
The family's put their heart and soul

484
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,825
into this home, as you can see,

485
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:12,228
and they really don't want to leave.

486
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,464
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

487
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:18,201
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

488
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,236
When I got here, I entered the house,

489
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,672
and it was extremely chaotic energy,

490
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:26,742
especially in the basement.

491
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:31,547
Like, when I went down there,
I saw all of these dead people.

492
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,216
There was about 50 of them,

493
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:37,586
which was very shocking.

494
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:41,257
The scary thing is that

495
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,793
all of those dead people are all negative.

496
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,261
There's not one good person in there,

497
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,964
and that was horrifying.

498
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:51,567
And one of the things

499
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,638
that also seemed to be a
constant throughout the walk

500
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,175
was the feeling of people thinking

501
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,646
that they're losing their minds,
that they're going crazy.

502
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:07,917
You guys do experience pretty
bad mood swings, right?

503
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,553
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

504
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,221
We'll be happy and just loving.

505
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,989
We love... We're a strong couple.

506
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:16,625
And we come in the house,
and the energy just zaps us,

507
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,661
and we'll start fighting immediately.

508
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,764
You come in, you know, it drags you down.

509
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,399
Mm-hmm.

510
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,102
So, during my research of the property,
it turns out

511
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,303
there's a long history of mental illness

512
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,039
associated with the land here.

513
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,708
Back in the 1860s,

514
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,577
the original owners of your property

515
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,013
were two brothers...
Lafayette and Theodore Peek.

516
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,415
There was a little bit of
bad luck with this family.

517
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,118
Both brothers had five kids.
Both brothers lost three kids.

518
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,187
But it got a little bit worse for Theodore.

519
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,290
Apparently, he went nuts...

520
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,692
walking up and down the streets,
talking to himself,

521
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,494
disturbing the peace, screaming,

522
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,731
to the point where his daughter
tried to have him committed.

523
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,099
So, I got the paperwork on that.

524
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:01,370
The thing is, there's been other cases

525
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,138
of neighbors in the area going crazy, too.

526
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,309
There was another guy that lived
here by the name of John Stitt.

527
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,211
Apparently, this guy was a womanizer.
He had an ex-wife.

528
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,779
He had a daughter. Has an affair

529
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,382
with his neighbor's wife.
He winds up marrying<i> her.</i>

530
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,184
They adopt a little, 14-year-old black girl,

531
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:17,786
and it was a rumor that he winds up

532
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:21,290
having an affair with this kid.
She's 14 years old.

533
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,324
Oh.

534
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:25,260
You know, a little bit crazy.

535
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:28,063
Yep. That all makes sense.

536
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,703
When I made it over to
the foot of the stairs,

537
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:36,906
I saw a woman with long, brown hair,

538
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,008
and she was panicking.

539
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,746
I could feel her fear.
She felt extremely overwhelmed.

540
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,980
Somebody that's living?

541
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,883
This is a living person, yes.

542
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,085
The thing is, is that...

543
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:53,989
the home is so filled with dead energy,

544
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:57,760
it can negatively affect the body.

545
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,229
And in this person in particular,

546
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,964
I was getting that she might

547
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,166
develop some type of heart issue?

548
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,904
I actually had
a period of time...

549
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,873
which I didn't think it was important,

550
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,075
and I didn't mention it to anybody...

551
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,078
that I was literally blacking out.

552
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,782
And I had to go through
a bunch of heart tests.

553
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,717
And they told me at the time

554
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,654
that I had neural myocardial syncope.

555
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,590
Okay.

556
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:32,995
That is very common with sensitives.

557
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,964
And unfortunately for mediums,

558
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:39,802
we can attract things that
aren't particularly good.

559
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,237
You think she's maybe sensitive?

560
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,706
Mm-hmm.

561
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,809
I think the house is full of sensitives.

562
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,818
What else did you see?

563
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,790
One of the other things that
I got was this female was,

564
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,292
at some point in her life,
abused by a male...

565
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:09,097
and is having a very difficult time

566
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,367
letting that experience go.

567
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,340
I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't want to

568
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,608
have to bring it up at the table.

569
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,310
You know, could you just share with her

570
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,780
what happened when you were a kid?

571
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:29,819
When I was a little girl,
between the ages of 3 and 4,

572
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,954
I was left with a male babysitter

573
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:37,359
who sexually abused me on several occasions.

574
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:41,930
He used to strip naked in front
of me and chase me around.

575
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,333
And he has since committed suicide.

576
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:53,175
Why'd you have that big reaction like that?

577
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,177
Uh...

578
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:01,349
I ran into a person in the basement,

579
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:04,352
and I referred to him as "The Creeper."

580
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:10,959
He's very disturbed,

581
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:14,397
and he attempts to make the living here

582
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,667
do bad things...

583
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,069
make them feel like they're going crazy.

584
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:25,040
He did not die that long ago,

585
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,877
and I did get that he killed himself.

586
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:33,315
Well, once you told me that
you thought he committed suicide,

587
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,718
I made some calls.
He went into a parking lot

588
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
with a car, broke the tail pipe off,

589
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,355
turned on the heat, windows closed,

590
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:41,757
in the end of August,

591
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,694
and was found dead.

592
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,561
And the caveat to the whole thing...

593
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,497
He'd just came home from babysitting.

594
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,004
Now, do me a favor

595
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,140
and tell Amy about the attacks every night.

596
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:02,345
One of the same nightmares
that I have every single night

597
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,379
is that I'm being chased.

598
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:07,382
You know, I try to, like,
defend myself in the dream,

599
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,318
and I've woken up with fingerprints,

600
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,120
bruises on my thighs.

601
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,858
Wow.

602
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,426
And I get scratched.

603
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,596
My daughter came to us and shared with us

604
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,833
that she felt like somebody
was trying to assault her,

605
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,202
and she has woken up with...

606
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:29,004
Similar bruises.

607
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,273
Oh, my goodness.

608
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,008
And they're unexplainable.

609
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,409
They got photos.

610
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:38,714
This is Michelle with some
scratches on her chest area.

611
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:43,552
There's their daughter, Shayna,
with scratches on her face area.

612
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,320
Wow.

613
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:47,356
Now, I spoke to a psychologist

614
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,491
just to get a grip on the whole thing,

615
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:51,026
and you having the nightmares

616
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,095
is totally explainable with the PTSD.

617
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,830
Yes, absolutely.

618
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,332
But the bruising and scratching don't add up

619
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,402
- based on the profile she gave me.
- Okay.

620
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:03,772
I did do a sketch with the creeper guy.

621
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:12,347
Take a look.

622
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:20,956
The sharp nose and the cheekbones...

623
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:28,496
He definitely reminds me of him.

624
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,301
The strange thing about him is,

625
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,769
I don't think he's the one
harming the women here.

626
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:39,408
He had very bad intentions
towards the males in the house.

627
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,445
He's trying to plant harmful thoughts,

628
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:47,149
telling the males in the
household to commit suicide,

629
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:51,253
wanting to drive them insane.

630
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:56,091
That's his main goal,
which is very concerning.

631
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:58,693
He'll never be successful.

632
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:01,263
Do me a favor and
tell her about the blade

633
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,798
that landed on your foot.

634
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,136
It was on September 11, 2005.

635
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,738
I sat the saw down carefully,

636
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,306
and the saw levitated,

637
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:14,276
came over my foot,
and chopped off three of my toes.

638
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,211
- Whoa.
- He had a picture of it, too.

639
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,984
Oh, my God.

640
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,289
There is something else that's here

641
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:33,462
that might be doing the major damage.

642
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,231
The first time I saw it

643
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,901
was when I was about to go up the stairs,

644
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:43,338
and it was just pitch-black and huge.

645
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:48,844
It had no face, just kind of a mouth.

646
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:54,016
It's, like, crawling oddly down the hall.

647
00:35:57,153 --> 00:36:00,089
It's like this on the ceiling.
You know what I'm saying?

648
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:03,992
So, I did a sketch of a scene.

649
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,300
Take a look.

650
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:23,345
Sorry. It's really not a good situation.

651
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:39,812
So, I did a sketch of a scene.

652
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,122
Take a look.

653
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:01,401
Sorry. It's really not a good situation.

654
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:16,850
We see a shadow every night

655
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:20,087
come across the stairwell to the basement...

656
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:25,558
and it is completely dark.
You cannot see through it.

657
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:30,763
But is the purpose for watching us?

658
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,432
What is it trying to do?

659
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:43,710
This thing is extremely old...

660
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:46,579
never been human.

661
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:51,751
And it's been wreaking
havoc around this area

662
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,120
for quite some time.

663
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:56,489
It's caused people to go insane.

664
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,993
Could that explain what happened
to the Peeks and the Stitts

665
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,696
that lived on this property at some point?

666
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,865
Absolutely, yes.

667
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,005
From a Christian standpoint,
you would call it the devil.

668
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:19,479
There are many of them all over the world,

669
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:23,350
and they are much more powerful than demons.

670
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:27,220
Is it this thing that's
giving her all the bruises?

671
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,488
Yes.

672
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,424
Whatever it is that scares you,
whatever it is

673
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:34,126
that will harm you,
it's going to provide it.

674
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:40,400
So, this guy here... Did
this devil bring him?

675
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,403
I think it's highly likely.

676
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,342
I'm really worried now.

677
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,278
If this is something
that we can't get rid of,

678
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,819
how am I, you know,
ever gonna be free of that?

679
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,763
Now, Dan, when we spoke,
you said you'd do anything

680
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,965
- to protect your family.
- Absolutely.

681
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,301
Now we're gonna see what it's gonna take

682
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:18,405
to protect your wife and your daughter.

683
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:21,007
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

684
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,547
If you stay here,

685
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:30,550
there's gonna be a lot
of things you need to do.

686
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:33,486
You have the devil.

687
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:36,689
You have the creeper.

688
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,425
You have the 50 dead people.

689
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:41,794
You would have to hit
everything simultaneously.

690
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:46,466
So I would recommend a
minister and a Wiccan.

691
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:51,638
Basically, you would have this
Wiccan priest or priestess

692
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,474
do a clearing and a banishment.

693
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:59,379
You would have the minister do a blessing.

694
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:02,249
What they're going to do
is push everybody out.

695
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:07,420
But... you ain't gonna
get rid of this devil.

696
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,124
So, you're saying the devil

697
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:14,027
would still be inside their house?

698
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:16,362
No, they would push it
outside their property line.

699
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:19,365
But it's not gonna keep him
out of the neighborhood?

700
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,267
Mnh-mnh, no.

701
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,804
It's always been here.

702
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,942
So, now, once the Wiccan and the minister

703
00:40:28,944 --> 00:40:31,411
come in and they do what they need to do,

704
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,846
how do they keep the dead away from here?

705
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:38,818
What I would suggest is, once a week,

706
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,488
you go out... And you can put a mixture

707
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,790
of salt and holy water

708
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:47,060
in just a regular spray bottle...

709
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:49,930
Going around and spraying the perimeter,
and then

710
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:55,635
spraying all of the window
ledges and all of the doors.

711
00:40:57,304 --> 00:41:00,540
Be very surprised if anything
happens inside the house

712
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,575
once you guys are doing all of this.

713
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,677
As far as your abilities are concerned,

714
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,713
I would begin with

715
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,350
finding an online or
in-person meditation workshop.

716
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:14,454
I would also recommend therapy for you.

717
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:22,362
I'm kind of disappointed
in myself right now

718
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:26,533
that if I brought a lot
of this about my family.

719
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:27,933
You can't blame yourself

720
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,869
for what happened to you in the past.

721
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:32,339
This thing was here before we got here.

722
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,640
That's true.

723
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:38,511
You can't help your family
until you help yourself.

724
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:41,814
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'd do anything to help my family.

725
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,683
What are you gonna do?

726
00:41:43,685 --> 00:41:46,386
We're gonna take Amy's advice.

727
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:48,721
We're gonna take her advice
and do everything as a team.

728
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,823
As long as you do all of these steps,

729
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:53,059
the safest place will be this house.

730
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:57,297
I really hope Michelle
and Daniel follow my advice

731
00:41:57,299 --> 00:42:00,500
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing their family.

732
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:02,602
With the help of a Wiccan and a minister,

733
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,537
they should be able to free themselves

734
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,606
of the darkness living inside their home.
