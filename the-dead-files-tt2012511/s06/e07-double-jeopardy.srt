1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,764
The guy in the black is bad.

2
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,099
He's always been bad.

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,955
I became obsessed with this place.

4
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:17,020
They think I'm insane.

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:19,555
He can induce fear.

6
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,525
Her attachment to the
place is a little spooky.

7
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,527
61-year-old male who hung himself

8
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:25,896
with a belt in the closet.

9
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:26,896
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,631
I never say I own the place.

11
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:29,966
I say the place owns me.

12
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,103
They're saying,
"Can't you get us out of here?"

13
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:37,307
I think that he harmed many women.

14
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,143
"You're mine. You can't escape."

15
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,479
My name is Amy Allan.

16
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,381
What's happening?

17
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:46,482
I see dead people.

18
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,919
It seems like a devil.

19
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,620
I speak to dead people.

20
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,289
He's pissed off.

21
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,723
And they speak to me.

22
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:55,858
I felt real fear.

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,828
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,831
I think she's being murdered.

25
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,432
I rely on my partner.

26
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:04,034
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

27
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:06,569
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

28
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,804
Serial killer pops in my head.

29
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:11,007
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

30
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,208
Nobody believes me.

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,676
It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,946
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

33
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:17,680
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:19,716
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:20,950
Until the very end.

36
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,685
You got problems. I got news for you.

37
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:24,888
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,956
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

39
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,225
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:31,294
This is their house, the house of the dead.

41
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,283
I'm in Santa Paula, California.

42
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,651
It's about an hour North of Los Angeles.

43
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:59,389
I got a call from a
19-year-old named Gabriella.

44
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:02,225
She tells me her parents, Rosanna and Tom,

45
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,560
live in and run a historic hotel.

46
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:07,330
Gabriella says the activity there is so bad

47
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:09,566
she won't step foot in the place.

48
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,603
She even sent me a video
that's got me really concerned.

49
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,906
<i>It just only hurt our
family by owning this hotel.</i>

50
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:19,376
<i>It has this very negative, dark energy.</i>

51
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,477
<i>I really worry about their mental health.</i>

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,048
<i>It just really freaks me out.</i>

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,149
I reached out to Tom and Rosanna,

54
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,685
who agree the hotel is
ripping their family apart.

55
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,188
They say if we can't help them,
they may lose everything.

56
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,969
Before Amy arrives,
I look for anything

57
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,605
that might influence her findings.

58
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,775
This hotel has a lot of
artwork and historic photos

59
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:55,111
that have to be covered or removed.

60
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,780
When I'm finished,

61
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:01,051
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

62
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,570
During my opening, I saw a cemetery.

63
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:24,206
There are adults crying... men and women.

64
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,009
There are about a dozen
little wooden crosses.

65
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,680
And I hear, "The children all died."

66
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,296
I feel really sick.

67
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:48,798
Like, I can't, like, breathe.

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,167
I think there's something in the air.

69
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,303
There's something in the air.

70
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:58,641
Oh, boy.

71
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:01,378
This is not good.

72
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:18,027
Rosanna, your daughter Gabriella
got in touch with me,

73
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,763
and she's really concerned
about what's happening here

74
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,233
and what happened to the family.

75
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:24,834
Gabriella has always voiced the fact

76
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,203
that ever since we bought the place,

77
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,439
she feels like she lost her parents.

78
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,074
Okay, so, do you think she's right?

79
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,275
Yeah, she's right.

80
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,776
Okay.

81
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:35,445
10 years ago, I came here

82
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:38,381
and I saw this building that was beautiful.

83
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:40,917
But it was in such disrepair,
I told my husband,

84
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,086
"Let's do something about this building.

85
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,621
This building needs help."

86
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,423
So, I convinced my family.

87
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,524
It was my idea, my project.

88
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:51,527
And my family really resents that.

89
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,530
I became obsessed.

90
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,864
Geez.

91
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,734
Now, who exactly lives here?

92
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,403
This is my daughter Aisha,

93
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:03,005
my husband, Tom, and there's myself.

94
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,974
Gabriella's in New York.

95
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:05,975
New York, yes.

96
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,411
And this is our home in Malibu.

97
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:12,081
We had the most beautiful, spacious home

98
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,451
on an acre overlooking the
most beautiful beaches.

99
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,287
- So, this is where you lived before?
- Yes.

100
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,523
And I understand you still own it,
but you rent it out.

101
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,592
- Yes, we do.
- And how long have you guys been here?

102
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:23,993
Six months.

103
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,795
So, if you wanted to go back there,

104
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,896
you can go back there.

105
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,264
I don't want to be rude,

106
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,766
but I think you're a little insane, myself.

107
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,535
I don't have the strength
and confidence to leave.

108
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:35,871
I think this place needs me.

109
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:36,939
At the same time,

110
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,208
it's destroying your family dynamics.

111
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,277
Yes. I'm very torn.

112
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,614
What's some of the overall things

113
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:46,516
that people are experiencing?

114
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:48,551
We get people that wake up
in the middle of the night

115
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:49,952
saying that they can't sleep here

116
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,888
because they feel that their bodies

117
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,590
are being pulled to the floor.

118
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:55,758
Contractors running downstairs and saying,

119
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,860
"We just saw these children
running down the hall

120
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,329
and then they went into a wall."

121
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,633
There are people who hear
their names being whispered,

122
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:05,101
like, "Steve."

123
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,235
Wow.

124
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:10,640
But also, people are jumpy... more anxiety.

125
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:14,210
And the intensity between my
husband and myself increased.

126
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:17,213
Everybody's, like, ready to snap.

127
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,149
How's your relationship
when you're not here?

128
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:20,283
Much happier.

129
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,685
So, why don't we just move out of the hotel?

130
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,688
I'm, you know, scared to leave it

131
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,690
because I don't know what would happen

132
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:31,027
if I ever thought of
selling it or leaving it.

133
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,429
How would it punish me?

134
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,641
There's something here that I don't like.

135
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:49,145
It's kind of making me anxious.

136
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:52,248
Like, that kind of
rock-in-your-stomach feeling.

137
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,718
Like, the fear is just disgusting.

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Like I'm stressed out.

139
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,555
I feel very stressed out.

140
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:03,459
I feel like something bad's going to happen.

141
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,836
I've been resistant to coming up here.

142
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:16,239
I get a creepy feeling here.

143
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,775
I can't even send my employees
up here by themselves to clean.

144
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:22,745
I always have to assign two
or with the maintenance guy.

145
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:25,415
- I mean, they just won't do it by themselves.
- Okay.

146
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,750
Now, this doesn't look renovated.

147
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,319
Eight years ago.

148
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,421
This was the last floor
that we were finishing up.

149
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:34,624
And we put this place up on the market.

150
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,526
- Okay.
- We did that a lot.

151
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,494
We renovated buildings and
then put them on the market.

152
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:40,330
My husband and I went on a trip.

153
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:43,866
And when we were on this trip,
we got the call from hell

154
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:46,969
saying that, "Your building is on fire

155
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,372
and we don't know if we're
gonna be able to save it."

156
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,109
Oh.

157
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,777
Wow.

158
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,278
It was just growing all over.

159
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,980
It was right about this area.

160
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,783
Anybody get hurt?

161
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,118
Nobody got hurt, thank God.

162
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,888
Now,
what makes you think this is paranormal?

163
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,923
This is the irony of the whole thing.

164
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:11,260
The fire was exactly $1.3 million of damage

165
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:14,497
and we were insured $1.3 million.

166
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:19,302
Like, it's trying to say to you,
"Hey, don't go anywhere."

167
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,870
Now you know why I have PTSD

168
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,038
from thinking about
putting it on the market.

169
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,241
This place has abandonment issues.

170
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,142
It doesn't let me go.

171
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:29,011
Okay.

172
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,894
Someone's yelling.

173
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:48,097
Someone... some female's saying,

174
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:51,000
"Oh, can't you get us out of here?

175
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,402
Can't you get us out of here?"

176
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,408
People running.

177
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,209
There's people running.

178
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,848
There was something like a
fire or something because,

179
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,518
um... you know,
there was a bunch of people here

180
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,722
and then they're all trying

181
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:16,392
to get out as quickly as possible.

182
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,739
You describe how this place

183
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:32,074
emotionally changes you when you come in

184
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:34,577
and how, basically, you're obsessed with it.

185
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:38,581
But have you ever had an
actual paranormal experience?

186
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,551
Well, there was one time
when I was going to a room.

187
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,119
And I was gonna use the restroom.

188
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:46,055
And it was in an area that was isolated.

189
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,590
And as I closed the door,

190
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:52,395
I noticed that the doorknob had moved.

191
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,598
I thought for a second

192
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,232
maybe my husband was trying to scare me.

193
00:09:57,234 --> 00:10:00,335
Then the doorknob fell to the floor.

194
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:02,605
And I thought, "Oh, my God."

195
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:05,608
I started hitting the
door and yelling for help.

196
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,244
I became like a crazy, psychotic woman.

197
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,580
And how long were you stuck?

198
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:11,714
About a half an hour.

199
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:15,084
They found me just devastated, just sobbing.

200
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,186
Okay. Now, it's an old building.

201
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,722
So you sure the doorknob just didn't,
like, fall out?

202
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,423
Well, I understand what you mean.

203
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:22,925
But I saw the doorknob move.

204
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:26,662
This place is telling me who's in control,

205
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,964
that there was an energy or presence there

206
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,768
that I had to respect,
and that they were in control.

207
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,736
And that's why I never say I own the place.

208
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,437
I say the place owns me.

209
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,039
And you really believe that.

210
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,040
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,009
'Cause there is something here.

212
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,511
Okay.

213
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:48,650
I see this guy
walking down the hallway.

214
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:51,487
He wears all black.

215
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,556
Yeah, ooh.

216
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,558
Ooh [bleep] me.

217
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,862
Yeah, he doesn't like women, for sure.

218
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:05,100
Yeah, the guy in the black is bad.

219
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,970
He's always been bad.

220
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,473
He definitely is saying, you know,

221
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:13,409
that he's dealt with women like me before.

222
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,379
What does that mean?

223
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,480
He's like, "I've taken those [bleep] out."

224
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:44,027
Well, Tom, I was talking to your wife

225
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,529
and she explained what's going on here.

226
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:51,501
You went from oceanfront
Malibu beach house to this.

227
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,802
It's night and day.

228
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:55,671
I mean, it is culture shock moving here

229
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,274
and moving to this
environment and this dwelling.

230
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:01,677
She also mentioned she's become
obsessed with this place.

231
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,879
Would you agree with that?

232
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:04,147
Yeah, it's one of the few things

233
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:05,849
that she says that I'll
agree with completely.

234
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,685
I'm surprised she admitted that.

235
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,855
Her attachment to the
place is a little spooky.

236
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,489
Do you believe in this stuff at all?

237
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:16,026
The answer is, I didn't.

238
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,263
- Have you had any experience at all?
- I've had experiences.

239
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,931
What have you experienced?

240
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,267
- Well, there's two distinct episodes.
- Okay.

241
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,770
The first one is I was brushing my teeth

242
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,804
and behind me, right here,

243
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:33,142
I heard somebody make this really weird,
menacing sound.

244
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,712
- So, I just whip around. There's nobody there.
- Right.

245
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,546
I ran. I had the toothbrush in my hand.

246
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,415
I had toothpaste dripping down my mouth.

247
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,785
I ran into the bedroom where Rosanna was.

248
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:43,053
It takes a lot to freak me out like that.

249
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,088
Tom, you said you had two incidents.

250
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,389
What was the second one?

251
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,992
One of the doors to an
upstairs room was locked.

252
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:50,293
And this was a room

253
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,461
that was not supposed to
be occupied by any guest.

254
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,798
The door was locked from inside.

255
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,466
We're concerned.
We're thinking there's a guy in the room.

256
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,834
He's not supposed to be there.
He's a stranger.

257
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:59,335
What's going on there?

258
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,938
I removed the door.

259
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,740
And I look around.

260
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,542
Nobody's in the closet.
Nobody's in the bathroom.

261
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,977
And the windows were locked from the inside.

262
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,113
I'm freaking out.

263
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,314
I start looking in vents.

264
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:12,982
There's an air conditioning vent,

265
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,217
but it's like this.

266
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:15,485
Check under the bed?

267
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,886
Yeah, looking under the bed,
but there's not even spaces.

268
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:17,954
There's nothing over there.

269
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:19,956
Everything's locked from the inside.

270
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,259
And that, to me, was even more eerie

271
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,228
than the thing that happened to me directly.

272
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,630
And if somebody says,
"Do you believe in ghosts?"

273
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:32,468
all I can say is, "Hey,
these things happened to me

274
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,569
and I can't explain them."

275
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,670
Do you think it's dangerous?

276
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,405
I think it could be. I think it's potent.

277
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:42,178
The guy in the black,
he's very physical.

278
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:46,849
Always, like, messing with people,

279
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,285
like, touching, touching, touching.

280
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,320
It's very distracting, very annoying,

281
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:53,723
and I'm sure very
frightening for many people.

282
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,394
Hmm.

283
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,730
Yeah, I think this is him

284
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:06,502
because I feel that same...
weight, that same fear.

285
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:08,939
Now I know what made me so anxious

286
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,441
when I first walked into the hotel.

287
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:12,942
It's this man in black.

288
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:15,178
His presence terrifies the living

289
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,380
and he enjoys watching them suffer.

290
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:22,152
He definitely knows how to induce fear.

291
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,155
He's saying that he can really harm people.

292
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,897
Aisha, your mom feels

293
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,933
that you guys are really upset with her.

294
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:40,636
We are.

295
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,305
She's obsessed.

296
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,641
The dynamic of the family
was very much disrupted.

297
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,611
I almost felt like she loved this place

298
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,778
more than me at one point.

299
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,880
So, you're living here for how long?

300
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,915
On and off for like 10 years.

301
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,351
Why'd you bring me into
this particular room?

302
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,753
Well, out of all the rooms,

303
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,188
I would say this is
probably the most active.

304
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,127
Recently, the curtains just started moving.

305
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,495
There was no wind.

306
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,030
The window wasn't open.

307
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,097
You have A/C in the room?

308
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,166
We do, but it wasn't on at the time.

309
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:13,403
And it was like 2:00 a.m.,
no A/C, windows closed,

310
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:17,373
and I look over and the curtains
are just dancing back and forth.

311
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,242
Okay, was it a windy night,
anything like that?

312
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,310
- Maybe a draft underneath the windows?
- No, no, no.

313
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:22,978
Now, let me ask you a question.

314
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,814
Would you stay in this place alone?

315
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,115
No, I couldn't.

316
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,751
This room specifically, there's an entity

317
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,221
that I think doesn't like
it when there's people here.

318
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,156
It's kind of like invading its territory.

319
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,366
The one tall, dark guy, like,

320
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:46,769
he doesn't want us to be in here
'cause this is his pad.

321
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,975
He doesn't like it when people are in here.

322
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:53,977
What does he do?

323
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:56,946
He makes it, like, weird, like,

324
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,516
loud and disturbing and shocking.

325
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:02,318
He's crazy.

326
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,920
So, I'm thinking, like,
the TV comes on full blast

327
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,857
or, like, an alarm goes off.

328
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,225
"Just get them out."

329
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:12,428
He's constantly touching me,
so I don't like that.

330
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,238
He's showing me, like,
he actually can hit people.

331
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,109
I see, like, he's choking women.

332
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,944
You know,
like I'm seeing this woman laying in a bed

333
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,414
and he's pinning her down

334
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,618
and he's, like,
punching her across the face.

335
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,867
I didn't think I'd have much trouble

336
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,133
digging up history on
an old hotel like this,

337
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,002
so I reached out to a local historian.

338
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,304
And she gave me more than I bargained for.

339
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,407
She says Tom and Rosanna's property

340
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:02,743
was the scene of a brutal murder.

341
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:12,352
Mary Alice,
you mentioned on the phone when we spoke

342
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:14,288
that there was a violent incident

343
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,890
that took place before
the hotel was even built.

344
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:18,025
Yes.

345
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:20,995
There had been a shooting on Main Street

346
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:24,364
which had been initiated
by this outlaw Joe Dye

347
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:30,237
who challenged a man for
having an affair with his wife.

348
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,738
The man's name was Herman Haines.

349
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,008
Joe Dye actually shot Herman Haines

350
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,444
on Main Street in 1886.

351
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,146
Mary Alice, the hotel, I know where it's at.

352
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,281
I saw Main Street.

353
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:41,582
So how far do you think the shooting was...

354
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,217
It was about a half block away.

355
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,218
- That's it?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,420
Now, did Joe Dye go to jail for this?

357
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:47,922
He did.

358
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,658
In fact, I understand he turned himself in.

359
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,260
But he was acquitted on self-defense.

360
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,328
Wow.

361
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,598
So, what kind of guy was Joe Dye?

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,932
He was a known outlaw

363
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,302
from Arizona and Southern California.

364
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,604
He was known to be very mean

365
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:06,306
and very violent and a high temper.

366
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,075
Nobody messed around with Joe Dye.

367
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,244
This guy's got that crazed look on his face.

368
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:12,613
Everybody was scared to death of him.

369
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:16,817
He even had notches on his
gun as the number of victims.

370
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,086
- He had several victims?
- Yes.

371
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,755
16 years before he was in Los Angeles

372
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,390
that he killed his boss.

373
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,992
Geez.

374
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:28,362
He also shot a dog of
some adversary or client

375
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:31,332
that he didn't like just to
prove that he meant business.

376
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:38,739
The guy in the black is not good.

377
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:42,977
I think he's from way back,
like 18... something.

378
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:46,746
Definitely a transient...
traveled all the time.

379
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,149
I'm not sure why the man in black is here,

380
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,885
but I can see that he's a coward

381
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,853
who shows himself as a shadow man

382
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,922
so he can terrorize living
people inside this hotel.

383
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:58,992
I think he killed prostitutes, mainly.

384
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:01,595
He definitely strangled his victims.

385
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,397
Occasionally, he'd have to shoot them.

386
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,569
So, when exactly was the hotel built?

387
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,206
The hotel was built in 1911.

388
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,109
- Mary Alice, you mentioned there
was another incident? - Yes.

389
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,812
Quite a few years later in 1969,

390
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:22,983
this woman, Ferry Banister,
was the manager at the time.

391
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,218
Okay.

392
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,188
And she was awakened in
the middle of the night

393
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,024
by somebody yelling and pounding on a door.

394
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,259
And so she, of course, went upstairs

395
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:34,261
to see what was going on.

396
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:38,365
And she came across this
young man just having a fit,

397
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,901
yelling he couldn't find his key.

398
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,338
So, she went down and
picked up the extra key

399
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,739
and brought it back.

400
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:50,377
And he beat her up and stabbed her.

401
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,912
And here is the article.

402
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,082
- He fled.
- Okay.

403
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:59,419
And witnesses saw him drive away in a car

404
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:01,955
and he was later arrested.

405
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:04,191
And what was the reason
for this guy stabbing her?

406
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:05,826
I don't think they know.

407
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,627
She's taken to the hospital.

408
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:08,796
She survives.

409
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,264
Is she alive today?

410
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,766
She died in 2004,

411
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:14,368
so she died an elderly woman in her 90s.

412
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:18,239
Ow.

413
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:20,507
Like, there's people fighting.

414
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,176
Ow.

415
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:32,619
Some... and there's some
kind of fighting happening.

416
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,958
I feel like somebody gets stabbed.

417
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,096
[Bleep] It hurts.

418
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,997
I feel like it's a knife.

419
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,000
I think it's a woman.

420
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,935
I feel like it caught her off-guard.

421
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,871
She's trying to get away.

422
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:56,577
You know,
I just see hands and feeling all this pain.

423
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,579
You all right?

424
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,580
Ow.

425
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:15,868
So far, I've got a family

426
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:18,207
that's been torn apart by obsession

427
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:21,341
and a property that's
been the site of violence.

428
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:23,310
But I need to see if there's anything else.

429
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,446
Digging through the archives,

430
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,248
I find that Santa Paula was devastated

431
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,451
by one of the worst disasters
in California's history.

432
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:35,455
But the headlines don't say how
it affected my client's hotel.

433
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:40,461
I'm heading over to meet with a local author

434
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,695
who says she's got information

435
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,196
that will definitely help my case.

436
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:51,788
Well, Peggy, thanks for meeting me.

437
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:53,320
I appreciate that.

438
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:57,439
I came across this article about
the St. Francis Dam disaster.

439
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,308
What can you tell me about it?

440
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,310
On the night of March 12, 1928,

441
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,946
it was just a few minutes before midnight,

442
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,514
the St. Francis Dam burst

443
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:08,717
and it released 12.4
billion gallons of water.

444
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:11,253
The flood wave was 140 feet high.

445
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:15,223
This is what the dam looked
like before it burst.

446
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:18,761
And this is what the dam
looked like after it burst.

447
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,930
Wow.

448
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:24,099
Five hours and 27 minutes
after the dam had broken,

449
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:28,471
the flood wave finally swept
out to sea 54 miles later.

450
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,972
It came right through here.

451
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,441
It came right through the
Santa Clara River Valley.

452
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:35,143
Look at it now,
and this is what it looked like afterwards.

453
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,350
By the time the flood
waters reached Santa Paula,

454
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:46,589
it was water and equipment
and trees and mud and bodies.

455
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,157
- Oh, geez.
- It was dreadful.

456
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,593
What kind of a body count we talking about?

457
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:54,362
The official body count was about 500.

458
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,498
Geez.

459
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,766
But a lot of people think that it would

460
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:00,335
have to be higher than that... 600, 700,
more.

461
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,104
Do we have any idea what the death toll was

462
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:03,305
for Santa Paula itself?

463
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:04,940
Well, approximately at least 200.

464
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:06,341
Where I'm investigating, Glen Tavern Inn,

465
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,977
was that affected by this?

466
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,644
The first floor received damage.

467
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:11,647
- It was on high enough ground.
- Okay.

468
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:15,017
So, the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge

469
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,786
for families that lost their homes,

470
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,689
that were trying to locate the
bodies of their loved ones.

471
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,093
Now, do they know what
caused the thing to burst?

472
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,729
They used shoddy building materials.

473
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:29,264
It was probably greed on
the part of Los Angeles.

474
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,532
Okay.

475
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:39,541
The floor is wrong here.

476
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,145
There's like this sinking,
like it's going down,

477
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:45,280
like a hole or something is here.

478
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,185
There's a lot of commotion here.

479
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,321
There's a lot of commotion here.

480
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:55,691
The floor was wet.

481
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:57,592
Something about the carpet was wet.

482
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:58,627
The carpet was wet.

483
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:04,500
There's a lot of arguing over this.

484
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:06,101
You know, the guys are like,

485
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,803
"This is gonna mess everything up

486
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,404
if we don't fix this right now."

487
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,941
The other men are kind of like,
"Well, we don't really care."

488
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:15,377
It's all about money.

489
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,449
I've already got a lot of history

490
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,885
on Tom and Rosanna's property,

491
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,120
but it turns out there's one more thing.

492
00:24:25,122 --> 00:24:27,689
A local sheriff tells me
he found a recent death

493
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:31,026
that didn't even make the papers
right on the hotel grounds.

494
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,004
Well, Sheriff Dean, thanks for meeting me.

495
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:43,205
I appreciate that.

496
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,373
You said you actually found
a death in the location?

497
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,043
Yeah,
we actually did some checking and found

498
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:51,046
that there was a suicide
back in 2007 that occurred.

499
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:53,315
This is a copy of the coroner's report

500
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,917
from the suicide.

501
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,485
He was found in the
apartments just to the rear

502
00:24:57,487 --> 00:24:59,788
of the guest rooms at the Glen Tavern.

503
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,991
61-year-old male, Henry.

504
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,258
So it said he hung himself.

505
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,060
What are the circumstances? Do you know?

506
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,461
He had been living at the hotel

507
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,663
and his family hadn't heard
from him in a couple days,

508
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,533
so they actually called
the keepers and said,

509
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,801
"Hey, would you mind going
and taking a look and check?"

510
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,737
They used the pass key
to go in and found him.

511
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:16,939
He could have been there
for one or two days.

512
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,373
Do you know what the circumstances were?

513
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,442
Did he leave a note or anything?
Or was it just one of those...

514
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:22,477
Really wasn't much out of the ordinary.

515
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,846
They did notice several 20-ounce beer cans

516
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,048
that were in the trash.

517
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,916
It appears he tried to hang himself

518
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:29,384
with a belt in the closet.

519
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:32,220
It looks like he wasn't
successful the first time

520
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:35,490
and found another belt and, unfortunately,

521
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,693
was successful on the second attempt.

522
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,699
I just hear the word "mad man".

523
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,875
And I see, like, a guy in the corner,

524
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:54,776
like, hunched down and balled up.

525
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:55,978
And he's like...

526
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,550
He'll get up on the desk or the bed,
you know,

527
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,585
and he's like constantly writing, writing...

528
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:05,154
scratching and writing on the walls.

529
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:09,791
I think this guy was probably schizophrenic.

530
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,127
I think he killed himself.

531
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:21,069
I saw several dead people on my walk,

532
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,270
but the man in black

533
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:24,572
poses the greatest threat to the living.

534
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:26,641
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

535
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:29,144
to describe how he appeared in life.

536
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:32,314
He was on the thin side,

537
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:38,220
between 5'10 " and 6'1".

538
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,057
I would say that his features were sharp.

539
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,996
He had a longer nose than usual,
very dark eyes.

540
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:54,536
Is this who you saw?

541
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:56,404
Yes.

542
00:27:17,432 --> 00:27:20,100
Now that Amy and I
finished our investigations,

543
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,903
it's time to reveal our
findings to our clients

544
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:25,039
and each other for the first time.

545
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:28,709
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Tom and Rosanna.

546
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,545
They're a married couple

547
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:33,680
that own this place and
they actually live here.

548
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:36,049
Now, you know how most of our
clients can't afford to move out?

549
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:37,485
They actually can.

550
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:40,054
I want to show you where they came from.

551
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:42,289
It's a Malibu beach house.

552
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,592
Problem is, Rosanna's gotten
obsessed with this place.

553
00:27:45,594 --> 00:27:49,130
It's taken over and she refuses to leave.

554
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,931
The activity's bad here

555
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,866
and it's tearing their family apart.

556
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,868
Matter of fact, here's a photo of everybody.

557
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,738
They have two daughters... Aisha, Gabriella.

558
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
There's Tom and Rosanna.

559
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,742
Aisha actually lives here.

560
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:04,145
But Gabriella got so fed up
with this place, she left,

561
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:07,081
went as far away from here as she could.

562
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,317
So, Rosanna wants to know
if it's safe to stay here

563
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,385
while the rest of the family

564
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:12,820
wants you to talk her into leaving.

565
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,355
So, now that Amy knows

566
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:17,291
a little bit about what's going on,

567
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,593
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

568
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,366
I was overwhelmed walking in.

569
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:27,568
I got initially

570
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,306
a lot of different types
of residual impressions.

571
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:36,643
The first one was when I
was on the second floor

572
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:40,448
and I kind of felt like
a fire had taken place.

573
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,716
I was seeing all the people running,

574
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,986
but I didn't feel like anybody died.

575
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:48,789
We had a fire in 2005,

576
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:52,059
and it was on the second and third floor.

577
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,895
It was a serious fire,
but nobody was injured.

578
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:56,063
Okay.

579
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,531
I actually have a photo of the actual fire

580
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,566
when it was happening.

581
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:00,968
Wow!

582
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,905
Now, this is the strange part.

583
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:07,641
They were insured for $1.3 million exactly,
right?

584
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:10,211
- Mm-hmm.
- It cost exactly $1.3 million to fix that.

585
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,247
Now, this is after renovating the place.

586
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,850
They were getting ready to
sell it and then this happened.

587
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:18,785
Okay. Wow.

588
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:23,624
The other thing that I got

589
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:25,292
was when I walked into the lobby.

590
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:29,596
I saw the floor sinking and,
like, the carpets were wet.

591
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:34,735
There was water,
and there were several men talking.

592
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:37,871
One man was saying that if all of this

593
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:41,642
wasn't cleaned up and fixed,
it would cause a mess.

594
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:45,546
Another man was saying
he didn't really care,

595
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,715
that he didn't want to waste the money.

596
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:51,685
It seemed to be a pretty
stressful situation.

597
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:56,423
Back in 1928, March 12th, to be exact,

598
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:58,392
St. Francis Dam gave way.

599
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:01,061
The Glen Tavern itself,

600
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:03,363
the only damage it received
was the first floor...

601
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:05,298
water damage.

602
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,433
Okay.

603
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,435
The rest of the town got hit really bad.

604
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:12,138
Now, the dam itself was
35 miles East of here.

605
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,074
But when the dam failed,

606
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,777
12.4 billion gallons of
water came rushing out.

607
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,447
The water got as high as 140 feet,

608
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,650
actually swept its way through this town.

609
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,484
They estimate 500 died,

610
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:27,253
at least 200 died that lived in Santa Paula.

611
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:29,523
Now, the other thing is everybody

612
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,559
that survived that flood
wound up in this hotel

613
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,829
at some point, you know, to seek refuge.

614
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:39,600
Makes sense now. Okay.

615
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:44,271
What else did you see?

616
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:48,441
When I was on the second floor,
there was a suicide

617
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:54,114
I got of a male who seemed
to be schizophrenic.

618
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,749
He was, like, crawling on the ceiling

619
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,484
and he was, like, writing on the walls.

620
00:30:57,486 --> 00:31:01,188
And I got that he hung himself.

621
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:05,793
Back in 2007, you guys actually
owned the place at the time,

622
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:08,094
a guy by the name of Henry,

623
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:11,164
he hung himself in the closet using a belt.

624
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:14,535
He had, according to the
coroner's report I read,

625
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:15,736
alcohol abuse.

626
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:18,238
He'd been drinking heavily.

627
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,474
Why he killed himself, we don't know.

628
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:22,776
- We remember him very well.
- Yeah, we remember him.

629
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,746
And he was a very nice guy.

630
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:28,148
What floor did you say this happened?

631
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,316
It's an outside area.

632
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:31,418
There's like two rooms.

633
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,654
That's correct. That's where it happened.

634
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,522
It's the exact spot where he hung himself.

635
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:37,758
That's right above our room.

636
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,992
Oh, wow.

637
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:41,261
I'm surprised that you
found out about Henry.

638
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:42,696
It was not in the papers.

639
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:45,098
I get information most people can't.

640
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:51,204
Anything else?

641
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:54,875
In several places throughout the hotel,

642
00:31:54,877 --> 00:32:01,248
I would suddenly feel this intense fear.

643
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,551
It would feel like a rock

644
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:07,154
just fell right into my stomach.

645
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:09,289
And then I would get really anxious.

646
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:12,358
I definitely thought that living people

647
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,661
would feel this sensation.

648
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:17,197
- She feels all those things.
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,534
I get that terrible pit in my stomach

650
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:22,670
and I don't know what it's coming from.

651
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,138
It's like this horrible thing,
like an impending doom.

652
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,974
Just...

653
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,275
Rosanna, do me favor.

654
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,477
Just explain to Amy about
the dynamics of the family,

655
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,679
how obsessed you really are with this place.

656
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:35,015
I feel at home. I love this place.

657
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,019
But my family, they don't like
the fact that I love it so much.

658
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:40,654
They're kind of jealous, I think.

659
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:43,190
That scares me.
It sounds like you want to stay here forever.

660
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:45,692
And that sounds strange.

661
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:47,528
It sounds obsessive.

662
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,397
Our kids had complained ever
since we bought the place

663
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,466
that it was causing us to
behave in unnatural ways,

664
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:56,102
that something seemed to happen to us here.

665
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,840
This is supposed to be temporary.

666
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:02,375
I like it here.

667
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:04,311
What can I say?

668
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:05,979
I love it. It feels like home.

669
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:07,214
I know. Sorry.

670
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:09,750
Tell them sorry.

671
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,054
Is there a reason she
may have a draw to this place?

672
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:15,522
Is she like a sensitive, maybe?

673
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,824
Actually, I think she might be

674
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:19,660
drawn here for a different reason.

675
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:23,463
Some people,
they'll just be attracted to locations

676
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:27,100
where they were in previous lives.

677
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:32,873
They feel this strong pull and
it feels like they're home.

678
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,875
- And they don't know why.
- And they don't know why.

679
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:37,177
But I've always felt that way.

680
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,080
Why would you come back? Seriously?

681
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:41,448
Because I like it.

682
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:45,218
And that's kind of an example

683
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,354
of how those situations can
become kind of unhealthy.

684
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:51,158
And it's become our life.

685
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,193
It's become kind of all-consuming

686
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:55,863
for our whole family.

687
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:05,238
The feelings that you've
had of anger and anxiety

688
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,176
are mostly caused by one entity.

689
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:12,212
And I met him on the third floor.

690
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:13,547
Hmm.

691
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:17,718
One of the rooms up there
is very much his area.

692
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,620
The room was 308.

693
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:28,328
He'll do whatever it
takes to keep people out.

694
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,965
He very much dislikes women.

695
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:35,468
You know, like I'm seeing
this woman laying in a bed

696
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,204
and he's pinning her down and he's, like,

697
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:42,308
punching her across the face.

698
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,678
He's not a good person at all.

699
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,514
Now, 308's your most active...

700
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:49,983
It's one of the most active, yes.

701
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:51,985
That's where you get most
of your customer complaints.

702
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:55,522
About two weeks ago, a man came downstairs,

703
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,690
just threw the key on
the front desk and said,

704
00:34:57,692 --> 00:34:59,726
"You guys didn't tell me this was haunted."

705
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:02,195
He stormed out of here. He was so mad.

706
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,267
She got locked in a
bathroom down here one time.

707
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:09,069
Explain that to Amy what happened.

708
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:13,106
I was in a bathroom inside of
a room that has no windows.

709
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:16,076
As I close the door,
I saw the doorknob move.

710
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:19,546
And then the doorknob fell to the floor.

711
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:20,981
Oh, wow.

712
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,349
And I started hitting the door
and screaming louder and louder.

713
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:25,853
And before you knew it,
I was in complete hysteria.

714
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:28,755
And then finally,
housekeeper happened to go in that area

715
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:29,990
and heard me screaming.

716
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:33,060
It was the scariest time of my life.

717
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,362
Now, is this something that this guy can do?

718
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:41,902
It's something that he
could and would probably do.

719
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,045
What I was able to get out of him

720
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:54,281
was that he was a transient.

721
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,717
This was back in the late 1800s.

722
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,989
And he is just a very,
very, very nasty person.

723
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:05,558
I do believe that this
male was a serial killer.

724
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,862
He killed women, mostly,
and they were prostitutes.

725
00:36:11,398 --> 00:36:14,300
His preferred method was to strangle them,

726
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,436
but occasionally he did
have to shoot people.

727
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:20,206
Now, I don't know about
anybody killing prostitutes,

728
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,876
but there's one guy that I
came across during research

729
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:26,013
that might have fit the bill,
especially the time frame...

730
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,647
the traveling, killing people.

731
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:28,882
It's a guy, Joe Dye.

732
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,217
Not a good guy.

733
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,886
He killed a boss of his in Los Angeles.

734
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,922
He actually killed another rival's dog

735
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:37,758
to let him know he meant business.

736
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,592
- He shot and killed a dog.
- Oh.

737
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:42,129
Apparently, he had notches on his gun
for the amount of people he killed.

738
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,199
- Well, you mentioned he hated women, too.
- Mm-hmm.

739
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,836
Back in 1886, he was married
to a very beautiful girl

740
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:51,338
here in Santa Paula on a ranch

741
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,373
and he used to go away a lot for work.

742
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,143
When he came back on one trip,

743
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,211
he had heard that this one guy,
Herman Haines,

744
00:36:58,213 --> 00:36:59,813
might be taking up with his wife.

745
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:02,348
Joe Dye, about a half a block from here,

746
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,649
put a bullet in his back

747
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:06,219
and the guy lived for
three days and then died.

748
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,789
I got a photo of him.

749
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:12,125
- He's a crazy-looking guy.
- Ew!

750
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,996
- Those eyes.
- Wow.

751
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:21,201
Now, do you think this is
the guy you might have seen?

752
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:22,970
I don't know.
You can look at the sketch and tell me.

753
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:29,509
Take a look. I mean...

754
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:32,846
Hmm.

755
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:38,351
They don't look like the same person.

756
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:43,123
I don't know about that.

757
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,392
If you put a beard on him...

758
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,327
Oh, yeah. Maybe.

759
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,399
Well, whoever this guy was,

760
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,567
what does he want with these guys?

761
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:59,873
What he wants is to continue
being the way he was in life.

762
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,675
So, he wants to kill women, really.

763
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,748
What do you think about all this?

764
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,817
I do know that there is something here,

765
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:13,053
but I also feel that there's
a lot of protection...

766
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:14,554
a lot of good.

767
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,556
And if there is bad entities,

768
00:38:16,558 --> 00:38:18,891
I'm sure that the good
ones will knock them out.

769
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:21,661
You think as long as you
respect the building,

770
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:24,231
it's gonna treat you well and protect you?

771
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:27,834
Oh, no, no.

772
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:29,502
Mnh-mnh.

773
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:49,507
You think as long as you
respect the building,

774
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,576
that it's gonna treat
you well and protect you?

775
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:55,179
Oh, no, no.

776
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,981
Mnh-mnh.

777
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,513
I do have more compassion

778
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,480
for what my daughters are saying.

779
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:13,650
I think Gabriella would be very
happy to hear you say that.

780
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,653
I think you're right.

781
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,158
I know that you're right.

782
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,609
Well, you know what?

783
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,409
We know what's going on in the hotel.

784
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:25,676
But the big question remains,

785
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:27,612
is it healthy or safe for you to stay here?

786
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,247
Or do you need to leave?

787
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:30,415
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

788
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:35,954
I do think that you had a past life here.

789
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,724
You have a connection here

790
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:42,493
and, unfortunately, in this situation,

791
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,230
you have deceased individuals here

792
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,733
who have a connection with you, as well.

793
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,301
And they're going to try to keep you here

794
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,770
and manipulate you and blind you

795
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:55,773
and bring that other person that they knew

796
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:58,276
more and more to life in the present day.

797
00:39:58,278 --> 00:40:02,748
But that was then and
that was another lifetime.

798
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,583
And this is now and this is your life now.

799
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:10,188
And you need to move forward, not backwards.

800
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,360
So, what I would like you to
do is bring in five mediums.

801
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:20,966
And there are three types of mediums.

802
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:23,835
And I would like one of
each of them to be present.

803
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:25,836
So, there's a mental medium,

804
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,473
a physical medium, and a psychic medium.

805
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:31,609
The other two can be of any discipline.

806
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:35,112
So, they would do two things...
clear the residual energy

807
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,715
from this place and also move on

808
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,985
as many of the deceased people as they can.

809
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:45,790
Following that, you should really consider

810
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,426
selling this place and walking away.

811
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:51,429
The dead are going to be whispering,

812
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,364
"Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave,"

813
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:55,967
and try to change your mind.

814
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,769
Will they let me go?

815
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:00,172
It's about you letting them go
and letting this building go.

816
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:04,009
Keep that in your head as a mantra,
you know,

817
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:06,278
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

818
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,079
"You're not gonna ruin my marriage,

819
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,382
"not gonna ruin my
relationships with my family.

820
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,983
This is my fricking life now."

821
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:13,751
I can see the possibilities

822
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:16,154
and I could see where I possibly can go.

823
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,990
But I'm torn because it's
like there's two people

824
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:21,326
and I feel that other
force coming within me,

825
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:22,994
like, saying, "No," you know?

826
00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:25,063
That my identity is here.

827
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,066
I do believe that I can do it,
but it's gonna take a process.

828
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,735
There's too much wiggle
room in that approach.

829
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:32,570
You just have to make a decision.

830
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:35,039
Let's say she moves everybody out

831
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,641
and she doesn't leave here.

832
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,977
Is her past life gonna consume her?

833
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:40,978
Yes.

834
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,747
I can see that happening, yeah.

835
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:46,251
I'm making myself and my family stuck,
you know?

836
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,886
Because it is so beautiful and it...

837
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:50,355
Let someone else take care of it.

838
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:53,057
You've done your time.

839
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:55,560
I really hope Rosanna follows my advice

840
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:58,129
and leaves her past life
in the hotel behind.

841
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:01,166
I believe if she does that
and embraces the present,

842
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,901
she and her family will be free

843
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,969
of the obsession tearing them apart.
