1
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:14,913
They orchestrate very violent, bad things.

2
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,662
Something's trying to harm my child.

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,240
He causes physical pain.

4
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:22,116
Did you fall down the whole flight?

5
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,521
I was pushed.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,831
It was able to manipulate
people's minds like puppets.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,873
Out of 13 children, only 6
of them lived to adulthood.

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,914
These kids... they're from hell.

9
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:37,674
I don't think this place
is good for anybody.

10
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,178
You're mine. You can't escape.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,217
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:45,128
What's happening?

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,405
I see dead people.

14
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,851
It seems like a devil.

15
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,896
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,366
He's pissed off.

17
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:53,703
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,609
I felt real fear.

19
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:58,857
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,164
I think she's being murdered.

21
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,271
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:03,611
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,418
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,787
Serial killer pops in my head.

25
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,897
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,101
Nobody believes me.

27
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,642
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,912
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

29
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,519
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,491
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:20,827
Until the very end.

32
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,699
You got problems. I got news for you.

33
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,707
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,711
This is our house, whether
they like it or not.

35
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,650
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,889
This is their house, the house of the dead.

37
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,930
I'm in St. Louis, Missouri.

38
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,205
A woman named Shanan practically
begged us to come out here.

39
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:57,878
She told me she lived in a
house that had a ton of activity.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,817
A few months ago, she had enough.

41
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,721
She picked up her four kids
and moved the hell out of there.

42
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,293
Problem is, her sister refuses to leave.

43
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:06,531
She's there all alone,

44
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,634
and Shanan thinks that
her life is in danger.

45
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:16,713
Before Amy arrives,

46
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,485
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

47
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,194
This house has a lot of family photos.

48
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:25,265
Once they're covered or removed,

49
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,773
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

50
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,035
Okay.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,116
Someone here... and I think
it's this tall, scary man...

52
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:56,687
he's able to manipulate the living body,

53
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,795
like he can cause
physical pain in the body.

54
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:05,803
He's a real... Freak.

55
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,217
What's wrong?

56
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,787
He is pretty [Bleep] powerful.

57
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:19,556
Eh, I'm concerned...

58
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:32,004
Shanan, you sounded
pretty upset on the phone.

59
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,371
- Yes.
- Okay.

60
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,272
So why don't you give me
an idea of what's going on?

61
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,476
Three years ago,

62
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,678
me and my children moved
in the home with my sister,

63
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
and little things just started happening...

64
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,585
noises, footsteps,

65
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:48,386
and then everything just
started to get physical.

66
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:51,455
Okay, what happened?

67
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:54,727
Hailey, my 10-year-old,
was hit with an object.

68
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,995
Is this a picture of them?

69
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,597
Yes.

70
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,731
- And that's her?
- Yes.

71
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,166
- This one right here?
- In the purple.

72
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:05,537
This brush came from nowhere
and just hit her in the back.

73
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,870
And you witnessed this?

74
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,438
We all witnessed it.

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,307
After that, I couldn't take any more.

76
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,774
It terrified me,

77
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,842
because something's
trying to harm my child.

78
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:16,576
That was the last straw.

79
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,576
I just told my sister I
cannot put up with this.

80
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,344
I will not.

81
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:22,444
That's when you were
like, "I'm out of here."

82
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,812
Yes.

83
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,512
You're picking on a
10-year-old little girl?

84
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,380
I mean, that pisses me
off just thinking about it.

85
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,781
Right. That's why I called you guys.

86
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:32,650
Since we have moved out,
my sister is in more danger.

87
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,083
It's gotten worse.

88
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,716
She's been pushed down stairs.

89
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,785
Is she all right?

90
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,287
She was hurt.

91
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,856
Like, she had a cast on for weeks.

92
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,057
What do you think's going on?

93
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:46,790
It might be targeting her,

94
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,755
and I'm worried about
her living here alone.

95
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,255
Okay.

96
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,125
This tall guy...

97
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,458
he's able to interact like a living person.

98
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:02,760
So, I did see something
with him and a child.

99
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:09,232
He'll come out of the dark,
and he takes off his skin...

100
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,731
Like reaching for the kid,

101
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,932
and the kid's all, like, scared.

102
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,066
Ugh.

103
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,038
The guy... he's [Bleep] pissed.

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,974
He says, "get the [Bleep] out."

105
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,348
Okay, so what's going on in here?

106
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,787
This might sound strange,

107
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,854
but we have all been sitting in this room,

108
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:46,121
watching television,

109
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:49,527
and coins would fly out
of nowhere and hit you.

110
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,762
Like quarters, dimes, that type of thing?

111
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:51,830
Right.

112
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:52,797
Are you sure it's not the kids

113
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,698
playing around with each other?

114
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,033
Absolutely not.

115
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,033
And why do you say that?

116
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:58,801
Because we're all together,

117
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:01,140
and I would be able to see

118
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,808
if someone physically
threw something at someone.

119
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,708
That is strange.

120
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,808
Yes.

121
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,608
Okay. Anything else down here?

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,176
This is one thing

123
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:13,914
that really makes me emotional to this day.

124
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,048
I am sitting here.

125
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,250
As I look toward this way,
apparitions came to me,

126
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,684
one after the other, like a parade,

127
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,185
like they were trying to get to me.

128
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,486
Now, describe the apparitions.

129
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,621
The first one, it was like a gladiator.

130
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,557
After the gladiator,

131
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,995
there was like a...

132
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,695
he was like an Indian,
like an American Indian.

133
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,064
And then there was another one.

134
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,135
It was just a white, like, tall, long mist.

135
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,504
I'm shaking right now. I'm sorry.

136
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,205
No, it's okay. I can see that.

137
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:53,142
Yeah. I'm shaking because
I'm just remembering this.

138
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:55,947
And I was crying profusely.

139
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,815
I have to ask, were you
cocktailing that night

140
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,150
- or anything like that?
- No, no.

141
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,719
Were you in and out of dreaming maybe?

142
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,188
No. I was alert.

143
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,957
Now, I know you experienced this.

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,559
Now your sister's here alone.

145
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,728
You worried about her going
through that by herself?

146
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,762
Yes, I do,

147
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,832
because I just need her to realize

148
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,002
what's actually going on.

149
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,038
It's not a game.

150
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,072
It's not.

151
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,145
That guy is here.

152
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,178
Who?

153
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,913
The tall one.

154
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,721
Do you know if he
interacts with the living?

155
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,590
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- How?

156
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:37,493
I would think that the
living would see him.

157
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:41,829
He's able to manipulate
people's minds like puppets

158
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,531
and cause them to hallucinate.

159
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,503
Don't know what they're seeing.

160
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,971
Are you worried he might be manipulating

161
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,605
what you're perceiving?

162
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,374
I am.

163
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:01,578
And there is a whole bunch of kids.

164
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,282
And what are they doing?

165
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,517
They make a lot of ruckus.

166
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,117
They're loud. They're annoying.

167
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,685
They're creepy. You hear them.

168
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:12,125
One weird thing about this guy...

169
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,027
he doesn't like them little things.

170
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,662
-
- He thinks that they're from hell.

171
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,546
So, Hailey, I was talking to mom today,

172
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:30,414
and she told me about an
incident that happened to you

173
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,015
with the hairbrush.

174
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:31,686
Yeah.

175
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,187
Can you tell me what happened?

176
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,121
We were on our way to go to school,

177
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,855
and we were all by the front door.

178
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:42,594
And then a push... it came
and hit me on the side.

179
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:45,229
And then I thought it was my brother,

180
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,530
and I was yelling at him
and getting mad at him.

181
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,898
And then my teacher...

182
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,768
she said it wasn't him
because he was behind me.

183
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,269
Okay, did it hit you hard?

184
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,137
Yeah.

185
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,905
Did you get scared when that happened?

186
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:58,073
Yeah.

187
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,942
So, are you worried about your aunt?

188
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:02,743
She's scared, too.

189
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:04,312
- But she won't tell you?
- No.

190
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:05,646
Now, would you come back to live here

191
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,447
if we could figure out what's going on?

192
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,019
Mm... No.

193
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,222
Okay.

194
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,899
These kids orchestrate really
very, very violent, bad things.

195
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,603
They're malicious.

196
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,272
I got to get out of here.

197
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,072
Really weird, and I don't like it.

198
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:31,576
I don't think this place is good for kids.

199
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:35,744
I don't think this [Bleep]
place is good for anybody.

200
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,707
Well, Krystal, it's good
to finally talk with you.

201
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,443
I spoke with your sister.

202
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:03,579
I spoke with some other family members.

203
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,747
They all want you out of here.

204
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,582
Yeah.

205
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,718
They're all gone.

206
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,887
And they feel it's unsafe for you here.

207
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:13,022
I got to ask you, why are you staying?

208
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:15,693
What's the draw to the
house that you won't leave?

209
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:19,398
I've put so much time into this house.

210
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,201
It took me two years to make it livable.

211
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:25,203
How long ago did you buy it?

212
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,305
It's been about six years now.

213
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,705
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

214
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:30,373
No.

215
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,041
Your sister mentioned to me

216
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,279
that since she's moved out with the kids

217
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:35,515
that activity's gotten
worse. Is that right?

218
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:38,417
Yes. I definitely think
it's gotten a lot worse

219
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:39,353
since she's been gone.

220
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,523
It's like everything's
being directed at one person

221
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:45,592
instead of six. There were six of us.

222
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,727
Okay. How is that affecting you?

223
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,295
I just don't feel like myself.

224
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:51,631
You know, sometimes I'm very moody.

225
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,735
Sometimes I'm very
angry, just for no reason,

226
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,871
or depressed.

227
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,508
When you're away from the house
for a day or two, let's say,

228
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,810
you feel better?

229
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,044
Yeah.

230
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:10,390
There is this older guy, and he's sick.

231
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:13,964
He... you feel it.

232
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,600
He died here.

233
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:22,138
He's very depressed,

234
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,308
very, very, very lonely.

235
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:32,552
He feels like he was just
abandoned and left to die.

236
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:34,657
He picks a spot,

237
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,826
and he stays there for a while.

238
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:41,229
One day this room will be bad,

239
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:43,798
and then like next week,
it will be downstairs.

240
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,599
Bad?

241
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,464
Yeah. The person will be...

242
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,597
they spend time in there,

243
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,332
they'll feel really, really depressed.

244
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,207
So, what's going on in here?

245
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,141
I have experienced a lot
of scary things in here,

246
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:07,410
and it keeps me from being able to sleep.

247
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:11,248
When I close my eyes, I
see really horrible images.

248
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,985
So, what do these images look like?

249
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,521
In each instance, they're black,

250
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:19,957
like really, really
black, like burned almost.

251
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,524
Now, do you watch horror movies at night?

252
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,525
No, not at night.

253
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,228
And I've never seen anything

254
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,932
like these things that I
see when I close my eyes.

255
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,567
What else is going on up in here?

256
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,970
Oh, my bed shakes.

257
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,510
The first time it happened, I
thought it was an earthquake,

258
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,411
but nothing else was shaking but the bed.

259
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,013
Show me how it shook, how
hard. What are we talking about?

260
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,714
Well, I was kind of sitting like this,

261
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,749
and then I just started moving like this,

262
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,951
like somebody was, like, on the other end,

263
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,389
like pushing it.

264
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,358
I know you have a small dog.

265
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,327
- Any other big animals?
- No.

266
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,796
Is it heavy enough that if
somebody was pushing on the bed,

267
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,496
it would have to be an
adult, or could a kid do it?

268
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:56,230
It would definitely have to be an adult.

269
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,400
How the hell are you sleeping in here?

270
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,268
I really don't sleep.

271
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,469
That's not good.

272
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,069
That's gonna take its toll eventually.

273
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,834
Mm-hmm. It already has.

274
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,245
This tall, scary man... he does stuff.

275
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:15,478
You know what I'm saying?

276
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,246
He's super smart.

277
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:19,116
He can manipulate the body.

278
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,951
He's a very physical presence.

279
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:25,354
He's able to interact like a living person.

280
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:28,624
He's like, "I'm the least of the worries."

281
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,959
No, you're a problem.

282
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:37,990
He's, you know, kind of...

283
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,360
Like torturing people
to get them out of here

284
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,960
because of these kids.

285
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,794
So he thinks he's helping the living

286
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:46,568
to get them to leave here
before something happens to them?

287
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,371
Yes, he does.

288
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:51,307
He does believe that.

289
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,176
We haven't talked about
why I'm really here.

290
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,610
- The staircase.
- Yeah.

291
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:04,284
So, did you fall down the whole flight?

292
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:05,517
The whole flight.

293
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,452
I usually don't stand here very often,

294
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,621
'cause it's really scary.

295
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:12,122
Okay, take me through what happened.

296
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:15,325
So, basically, I just walked up the steps,

297
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:20,997
and then, all of a sudden,
I... fell down the stairs.

298
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:24,000
And I apparently did a cartwheel.

299
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:26,202
You can even see where
the bottom of my shoe

300
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,704
made a mark on the wall.

301
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:32,510
And then I fractured my elbow
at the bottom of the stairs.

302
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,445
How do you think you fell?

303
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,846
It's hard for me to say this,

304
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,749
but I think that I was pushed...

305
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,054
because I fell really hard.

306
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,255
I'm really concerned for you.

307
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,428
- You're here alone.
- Yeah.

308
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,431
And you're not sleeping.

309
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,734
You're almost killed.

310
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,935
That would have killed most people.

311
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:54,271
Yeah. One of the kids
probably wouldn't have made it.

312
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:01,487
These little kids that are here...

313
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,325
they were not right.

314
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:08,433
They weren't normal when they were alive,

315
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:14,272
and I think that they...

316
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:17,411
are really damaged now.

317
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:26,787
What do these kids do?

318
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,295
They make big things happen...

319
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,894
over time.

320
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:38,332
They cause really very,
very violent, bad things...

321
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,034
to happen.

322
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:46,178
"Catastrophe" is the word
that I hear being used.

323
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,713
I don't like this.

324
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,382
I don't like this.

325
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:06,472
Usually, clients know a little bit

326
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:08,207
about the history of their property.

327
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,611
Krystal doesn't have a clue.

328
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,148
So I started from the beginning

329
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,546
and tracked down the
original owner of the land,

330
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:15,881
a guy named B.W. Alexander.

331
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,351
And when I reached out
to one of his descendants,

332
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,453
she said we definitely needed to talk.

333
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,220
Marcia, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

334
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,621
Now, you're a descendant of B.W. Alexander.

335
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,789
Basil William Alexander was
my third great grandfather.

336
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,224
What can you tell me about him?

337
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,059
He was a self-made man.

338
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:41,059
He actually as a young man

339
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,627
was indentured out to a bricklayer

340
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,061
and worked in servant conditions,

341
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:49,232
worked his way up, got
out of that situation,

342
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:51,101
and started making his own business

343
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:54,166
and making a name for himself
and made a lot of money.

344
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,369
He ended up being on the board of directors

345
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,104
of several banks in town,

346
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:02,637
and he really grew to be
quite an influential man.

347
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,644
This is a picture of him
when he was in his heyday.

348
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:06,779
Quite a prominent man.

349
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,379
He's a big guy.

350
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,514
Even though this obviously looks like

351
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,482
he's a healthy, well-fed man,

352
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,716
death records show when
he finally died at age 79,

353
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:18,548
he actually died of marasmus,
which is malnutrition.

354
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,519
He wasted away to nothing.

355
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:33,730
This tall, scary man.

356
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,599
I wish he would tell me more

357
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,237
about what, like, what his deal was

358
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,239
when he was alive and stuff.

359
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,507
Can you describe him?

360
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,577
He's very thin. He's very lanky.

361
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,111
When he was alive,
like, he still was tough,

362
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,814
like people were afraid of him anyways.

363
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:56,915
You know, I don't think
he was such a great person

364
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,719
when he was alive, you know?

365
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:04,726
I think he, you know, kind
of did maybe shady things,

366
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,397
you know, to make money, you know?

367
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,668
He's super smart.

368
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,274
Very smart person and knows
how to, you know, work it.

369
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:20,178
When I started to get
in there to see things,

370
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,384
he got really sad and was
kind of like vulnerable.

371
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:26,486
He didn't like that.

372
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:29,322
But now he's very angry.

373
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:31,591
During the research,

374
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,028
I found that B.W. was the original owner,

375
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,699
bought the property I'm
investigating back in 1860.

376
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,633
1860 is what we show.

377
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:39,969
He bought 80 acres.

378
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,506
We have a map here that shows his land.

379
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,340
He had a home there.

380
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:45,175
He had a rock quarry, a vineyard,

381
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,777
and slaves quarters.

382
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:49,682
Now, do you know how
many slaves he did have?

383
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:52,283
Family records show that
during the civil war,

384
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,985
he had up to 23 slaves.

385
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,222
So it was families, you know, men, women,

386
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:58,124
and, of course, their children.

387
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,860
And, you know, if they died,

388
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,430
they were buried on the property.

389
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:08,511
The tall, scary man...

390
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:15,322
he does not want me to seek these...

391
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:18,526
Things out, you know? But...

392
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,960
the children?

393
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,029
Yeah. But then I'm like,

394
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:25,829
"well, why don't you just tell
me, you know, what they are?

395
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,365
And then we're good."

396
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,063
The tall man doesn't
want me to know anything

397
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:33,699
about the kids in the house,

398
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:36,501
but I'm determined to
find out more about them.

399
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,570
And something is telling
me to head to the basement.

400
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,877
He definitely has a lot of control

401
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,375
over the other dead people here.

402
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:54,779
Somebody says something about bad kids...

403
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,214
well, bad children.

404
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:57,982
And then I'm hearing "headmaster."

405
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:02,887
And then somebody's yelling about justice

406
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,357
and, you know, doing what
needs to be done to them,

407
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,093
you know, that they're like [Bleep] demons,

408
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,598
and, you know, they
don't have souls anyways.

409
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,035
I don't know what's going on here.

410
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:16,337
This is getting [Bleep] weird, man.

411
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,576
This is going pretty back,

412
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:24,313
you know, like 1860s.

413
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:27,985
I don't really want to
be down here anymore.

414
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,253
Marcia, you mentioned on the phone

415
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:33,355
that B.W. had some tragedy in his life.

416
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,591
What were you talking about?

417
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:37,331
A lot of people came in and out of his life

418
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,898
and died sad deaths.

419
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,068
He lost his first wife at a very young age.

420
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,271
She was only 22.

421
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:45,940
Out of his 13 children
that were born to him,

422
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,140
only 6 of them lived to adulthood.

423
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:51,112
Several of them died as young children.

424
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,516
As a matter of fact, one year,

425
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,920
he lost three children
within a week of each other.

426
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,087
And do we know what they died of?

427
00:20:58,389 --> 00:20:59,657
Probably Scarlet fever.

428
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,460
I don't know if I would have been
able to handle something like that.

429
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:02,927
I can't imagine.

430
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:10,601
This tall, scary man...

431
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,905
I want to say that he lost a child.

432
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,038
I think he lost a son.

433
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,776
He believes in heaven and hell and God,

434
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,879
but he denounces them.

435
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,849
He is very confusing.

436
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:29,453
He might have been summoned to
do some kind of messed up stuff,

437
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,091
'cause he's doing some pretty bad [Bleep]

438
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:50,766
There's so much death associated
with my client's property,

439
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,702
but I still need to know
if there's anything else.

440
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,472
So I'm hitting the books
at the local library.

441
00:21:58,607 --> 00:21:59,875
Digging through old records,

442
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:03,681
I uncover a murder/suicide
that happened in 1894,

443
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:08,051
right across the street
from my client's house.

444
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,051
I'm heading over to meet

445
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:10,786
with the city's chief medical examiner

446
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,786
so he can help me make sense of it all.

447
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:22,759
Well, Dr. Graham, thanks for meeting me.

448
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:23,960
I know you're a busy man.

449
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,760
Now, what can you tell me
about this murder/suicide

450
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,227
that happened across the street

451
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,895
from the property I'm investigating?

452
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:32,930
Basically, there was
a new house being built

453
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:35,265
for a construction boss
or a carpenter boss.

454
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,465
Okay.

455
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:40,203
And he had fired one of his
workers a few days earlier,

456
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,769
probably because of the
worker being a drinker.

457
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:44,403
- That was a Mr. Stute.
- Okay.

458
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,676
And so Mr. Stute thought
about it for a while

459
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:49,279
and really got agitated,

460
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,849
brought his double-barreled
shotgun to the work site.

461
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,350
One of the following mornings,

462
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,449
Mr. Wench, who was the carpenter boss,

463
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,948
was on the second story
of this unfinished house.

464
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,281
Okay.

465
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,885
Mr. Stute came in and discharged one barrel

466
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:06,054
of the double-barreled shotgun

467
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:09,489
and looks like hit Mr.
Wench in the jaw area,

468
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,089
and then up and out through the face.

469
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:12,957
And, in fact, I've got a
copy of the newspaper article

470
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,057
and one of the artist's renditions.

471
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,857
Oh. Look at that.

472
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,059
And then as soon as he did that,

473
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:24,528
Mr. Stute put the stock
of the gun on the floor,

474
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,297
leaned over it with the
muzzle against his belly,

475
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,302
and discharged the second
barrel and took his own life.

476
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,669
Wow.

477
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,839
And I was able to locate the
original coroner's inquest

478
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:35,874
for each of those deaths.

479
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:36,876
You're kidding me.

480
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:38,377
This is the original paperwork?

481
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:40,746
This is the original paperwork from 1894.

482
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:46,312
And as it turns out,

483
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:48,579
Mr. stute did not die right away,

484
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,181
but was taken to the old city hospital,

485
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:54,983
where he was operated on
and died within a few hours.

486
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:00,290
I would say that this is a busy area,

487
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:03,624
and so I don't know

488
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:09,627
if what I'm getting is site-specific,

489
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:15,361
but I did have this pain
in my back right here,

490
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:18,265
and it goes all the way through.

491
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:21,064
Extremely painful.

492
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:25,468
So I think that someone maybe got shot.

493
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,901
I don't know front or back.

494
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:33,474
I think that it was a male.

495
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,909
And the problem is

496
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:39,209
I don't know if it was murder or suicide.

497
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:52,811
During my walk, I saw a tall, thin man

498
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:55,315
who was able to cause hallucinations.

499
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:57,251
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

500
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:59,251
to describe how he appeared to me.

501
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:02,253
He was approximately 6'4",

502
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:05,488
extremely thin, especially for his height.

503
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,557
His hair goes back.

504
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,861
Very dark eyes.

505
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,362
Next, I described the childlike entities

506
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:14,929
who are plotting to harm a living person.

507
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,625
So it happened at the top of the stairwell.

508
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:19,060
They were all together.

509
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:20,861
There was about three of them,

510
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:25,526
and they had decided
to do this to this lady.

511
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,166
Is this what you saw?

512
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,701
Yes.

513
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,511
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

514
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:05,411
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

515
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,478
and our clients for the first time.

516
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,445
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Shanan and Krystal.

517
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,814
Now, they're sisters.

518
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:15,286
Krystal actually owns this home,

519
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:17,923
and Shanan was living
here with her four kids.

520
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:19,324
I actually have a photo.

521
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,033
Aw.

522
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:28,702
Well, thing is, activity got
so bad here a few months back,

523
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,707
she packed up herself and
the four kids and got out.

524
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,578
Problem we got here is that
Krystal is still in the house,

525
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,713
and she's here alone.

526
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:40,051
Shanan called us in

527
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:43,087
'cause she's afraid that
her sister may be in danger.

528
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,622
So with that, I'm gonna ask Amy

529
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,492
to tell us a little bit about her walk.

530
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:54,362
So, when I was first upstairs,
I met an elderly gentleman,

531
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:58,097
and he feels very lonely and very sad.

532
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,434
And basically, he's a little scattered,

533
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:07,306
but what he does mostly
is he'll wander around,

534
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,408
and then he'll, like, settle in a room.

535
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,640
So if you go into that
room and he's in there,

536
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:14,609
you'll feel sick,

537
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:18,948
you'll feel depressed, you'll feel lonely.

538
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:22,084
Yeah, my moods change.

539
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:25,089
I feel sadness for no reason.

540
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,758
I get angry for no reason.

541
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,429
There are days when I go to work,

542
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:34,569
and I would just have,
like, the worst attitude.

543
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,906
But then, after I'm there for a while,

544
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:37,939
then it goes away.

545
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:42,212
Since I have been here,
I've totally changed.

546
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:46,886
I can be very mean sometimes,
and that's not my character.

547
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:50,892
Okay.

548
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,595
There was another person who,

549
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,897
as soon as I was heading up the stairs,

550
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,633
he told me to get the "F" out.

551
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,770
He was very secretive.

552
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:05,446
He's very capable of
interaction on a physical level.

553
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:09,187
People definitely see this guy.

554
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:16,293
I saw this person push
himself out of his skin,

555
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:21,299
and then he was just like
a skeleton with muscle.

556
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:26,144
And I saw him standing by
the side of a child's bed.

557
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:29,147
That's my son.

558
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:32,983
He told me somebody sits by his bed.

559
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:36,385
Did you believe him when he told you?

560
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:40,256
No. I didn't.

561
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:43,227
Need a minute?

562
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm fine.

563
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:49,099
This man's very intelligent,

564
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:52,466
very manipulative, very cunning.

565
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,503
He can cause the living
to have hallucinations.

566
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:57,806
He's so good at this

567
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:02,442
that there was a lot of
confusion on this walk for me,

568
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:04,680
because I didn't know what was the truth.

569
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:07,915
Was he making me hallucinate?

570
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:10,487
These girls talk about
hallucinations, both of them.

571
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:12,755
Mm-hmm.

572
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:15,993
Can you tell Amy about that incident

573
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:17,364
down here on the couch?

574
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,706
These three images just came
to me, one after another.

575
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,842
The first image is
being the gladiator type.

576
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:30,576
Mm-hmm.

577
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,944
The second was like an American Indian.

578
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:37,083
And then the third one, it
was just a white something.

579
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,353
I couldn't tell,

580
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:41,723
but I was the most
threatened by the last one,

581
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,824
and it terrified me so bad.

582
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,692
You had mentioned to me

583
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:48,429
you get those images when
your eyes are shut, right?

584
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:52,566
Yeah. They're like ungodly creatures.

585
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:55,268
They scare me so bad.

586
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,203
Now, you mentioned this
guy can be physical, right?

587
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:57,906
Yes.

588
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:01,373
They got something really
strange going on in this house.

589
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:05,143
They have coins getting
thrown at them out of nowhere.

590
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:05,977
I've seen it.

591
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,613
Everyone is in this area.

592
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:11,517
Everyone is sitting
around, watching television.

593
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,986
No one's moving.

594
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:14,722
Next thing you know,

595
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:18,358
my son is, like, saying "ow,"

596
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,395
and then a coin drops to the floor.

597
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:25,932
They're in physical sight of me.

598
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:28,499
I know that neither one
of them could do this.

599
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,669
And the reason you left here

600
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:34,706
is because your daughter
got hit with a brush.

601
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,306
Yes.

602
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,074
Down here, in the back.

603
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:39,242
And they don't keep any brushes down here.

604
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:41,980
Mm-hmm. Okay.

605
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,150
Is he capable of doing anything like that?

606
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:47,021
Yeah. He's able to do that.

607
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:52,064
Now, did you get any sense of
who this guy might have been

608
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,329
when he was alive?

609
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:57,702
What I got was that he
was directly connected

610
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,502
to this property.

611
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,638
He was, like, showing himself

612
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,445
to be, like, extremely tall, very thin.

613
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,777
You could really see his bones.

614
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,616
I got that he was a very intimidating guy.

615
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,952
I think it was because he
was really, really smart,

616
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,685
very commanding, and people
were very afraid of him.

617
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:21,058
But he's actually very sad,
and after quite some time,

618
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,827
I got that he did lose a
child and that it was a son.

619
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:28,095
After some time of being very sad,

620
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:32,370
became very angry, he denounced God.

621
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:36,570
Now, back in 1860,

622
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,005
this property was acquired by a guy

623
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:39,506
that I think she may be talking about,

624
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,607
is this guy B.W. Alexander.

625
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,009
1861, he moved his entire family here,

626
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:46,177
along with his 23 slaves.

627
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:50,979
Now, you said this guy was tough, smart,

628
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,514
and intimidated people.

629
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:55,249
Well, Alexander was a pretty powerful man

630
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:56,750
in this neighborhood.

631
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:59,853
This is a guy that went
from rags to riches.

632
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:03,353
He was an indentured servant
at one point as a kid,

633
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:07,150
ran away, and became a
self-made millionaire.

634
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,820
You said he lost a son.

635
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:09,389
Right.

636
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,557
Now, this guy had 13 children altogether.

637
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,592
Six of them died.

638
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:17,559
Four of them were boys.

639
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,628
You said he was a big guy,

640
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,627
but then you said he was skinny.

641
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:24,428
Mm-hmm.

642
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,932
He died of a thing called
marasmus... malnutrition.

643
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,334
Oh.

644
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:31,135
He died at the age of 79.

645
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,870
He was a big guy,

646
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,707
but by the time he died,
he was pretty emaciated.

647
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:40,012
I actually have a picture
of B.W. Alexander right here.

648
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:45,454
So, I don't know if this is
the guy you might have ran into.

649
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:47,888
Uh... No.

650
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,862
But I did do a sketch of the
tall, thin man I encountered.

651
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,273
Well, that ain't him.

652
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:02,673
No.

653
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,184
No.

654
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:19,293
You think it's somebody you might know?

655
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:22,493
Well, I didn't even think about
this until she said something,

656
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:25,129
but my son... a long time ago,

657
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:28,031
he used to tell me that
somebody used to sit by his bed.

658
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:31,234
And he told me that he looked like daddy,

659
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:33,535
like his father.

660
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:34,970
His father is alive,

661
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,904
and he looks something like him.

662
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:41,477
So he shows himself to be something

663
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,781
that he would be comfortable with.

664
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,849
Actually, I think he might
be showing himself like that

665
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,485
to warn the living here,

666
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,522
because the other thing I got

667
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:55,658
was these childlike entities,

668
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,931
and the guy I was talking
to became very afraid.

669
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:04,904
He said that these were evil things.

670
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:07,741
I went looking for them,

671
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:11,177
and I ended up in the basement,

672
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,212
where I encountered this other guy.

673
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:21,188
And the children called him a headmaster,

674
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,091
and this male was definitely
abusive to these children.

675
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:29,562
It made me extremely uncomfortable.

676
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:32,897
I got that this was pretty
far back, like 1860s.

677
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,804
You say "headmaster," and
then you're going back in time.

678
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,171
There might have been slave kids

679
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:39,570
and this guy was mistreating them.

680
00:34:39,572 --> 00:34:41,273
Instead of "headmaster," but "master."

681
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,074
I don't know,

682
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:45,439
but the living might see them

683
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,342
kind of out of the corner of their eyes.

684
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,744
They cause a lot of ruckus.

685
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:54,113
You'll hear a lot of,
like, movement or sound.

686
00:34:54,115 --> 00:35:00,019
Also, they like to
orchestrate, like, catastrophes.

687
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,222
What do you mean by that?

688
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:09,092
Well, I was seeing a lot
of different scenarios

689
00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:12,596
that these kids were planning,

690
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:17,466
and one of the things was
something that I sketched.

691
00:35:17,468 --> 00:35:18,434
Okay.

692
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:27,812
Oh

693
00:35:34,952 --> 00:35:36,285
I don't know if I want to show you this.

694
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,958
Oh...

695
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,327
Are you kidding me right now?

696
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:09,498
I was seeing a lot of different scenarios

697
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,972
that these kids were planning,

698
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:17,108
and one of the things was
something that I sketched.

699
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:27,022
Oh

700
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:30,593
I don't even know if I
want to show you this.

701
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,162
Oh...

702
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,702
Are you kidding me right now?

703
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:48,874
This is what I was afraid of.

704
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,109
I'm a pretty skeptical guy,

705
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,881
but when Amy comes up
with things like this,

706
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,615
there's just no explanation.

707
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:12,196
That's almost exactly how I got hurt here.

708
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,765
They already hurt you?

709
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,936
God, stop it.

710
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:25,377
I was standing on the landing
at the top of the stairs,

711
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:28,415
and then I felt a push,

712
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:35,492
and I fell so hard that I
tumbled, like, completely,

713
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:38,264
and I hit the door with
my back and my head,

714
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,466
and I flew forward.

715
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,902
Ohh.

716
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:44,709
I fractured my elbow.

717
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,077
That's how hard I fell.

718
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,313
I'm shocked that you're still here.

719
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:56,188
I can tell you one thing
is that these kids...

720
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,688
they're trying to reorganize

721
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,889
and figure out a better way
to make you hurt yourself.

722
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:06,924
They're not giving up.

723
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:09,027
So...

724
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:18,569
This is what I think is going on here.

725
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:22,305
The male that I encountered
while he was alive

726
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:25,677
probably had a fractured sense of self,

727
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,983
possibly having multiple personalities,

728
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:35,892
and when he died, they kind of separated,

729
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:39,398
creating many different entities.

730
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,137
So, if I'm reading you right,

731
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:45,976
is the headmaster and the tall
guy the same person but split?

732
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:48,146
I think so, yes. I do.

733
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,482
I think it's two aspects of this guy.

734
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,491
Even the elderly man
could also be part of him.

735
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:02,130
The thing is, is he'll do
anything to make you leave,

736
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,396
even if it is horrifying.

737
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:10,734
But what he was telling me was
that he was doing these things

738
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:13,469
to protect the families here...

739
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:15,205
What?

740
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:19,076
Because he knew that these children

741
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:24,516
are here who mean big, big harm.

742
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:33,094
So, for him to appear as
your son's father makes sense,

743
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:39,867
because he's trying in his
warped way to be the protector.

744
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:44,173
But, you know, there
being living children here

745
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:48,341
is not an option right
now, as you are aware.

746
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:54,709
It's not a good place for
living people in general,

747
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,544
but very much children.

748
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:09,088
Well, Shanan, it's very good

749
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,755
that you moved the kids out of here,

750
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:14,925
and it's even better that
you called us in, all right?

751
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:16,827
You weren't over-reacting.

752
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,660
Obviously, your sister was in danger.

753
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:23,964
The big question is,
can she stay here safely?

754
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,806
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

755
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:38,182
Initially, I was thinking
about an exorcism.

756
00:40:41,654 --> 00:40:43,288
But since he's trying to make up

757
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,456
for the evil he's done in the past

758
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,990
and protect you from these things here,

759
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:49,958
I want to try something else first.

760
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,265
So you need to bring in a chaos magician.

761
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:58,067
A chaos magician uses anything
from religion, science,

762
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,737
to cultural traditions to
clear an area of the dead.

763
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,271
There's no set formula,

764
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:05,239
as they work on a
case-by-case basis,

765
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:06,406
but when they're done,

766
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:09,175
Krystal's home should be free of the dead.

767
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:12,144
So, everything would be cleared out, then?

768
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:13,312
Yes.

769
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:14,979
Including the kids?

770
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,845
Yeah.

771
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:22,416
But I do have a concern for
you being here in the meantime,

772
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:27,586
because they're going to
feel extremely threatened

773
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:31,188
and very unhappy.

774
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,889
So basically you're telling us

775
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:36,226
she should go stay someplace
else till she gets this guy in.

776
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,526
I think you should, yes.

777
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:43,095
Would you be able to swing that?

778
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:44,730
Definitely.

779
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:46,264
You don't have to worry about that.

780
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:50,170
I just wish I could get
it started, like, tonight.

781
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,940
I will call him.

782
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:58,114
I'm concerned for Krystal,

783
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,948
as the entities within this house

784
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,916
pose a very real physical danger.

785
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,389
But I believe that if
she follows my advice,

786
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:06,457
she'll remain safe

787
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:08,426
and be able to lead a peaceful life

788
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,363
in the home she loves so much.
