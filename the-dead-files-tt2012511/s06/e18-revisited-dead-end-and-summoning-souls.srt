1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,538
AMY:
There's a darkness here.

2
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:10,209
NARRATOR: Tonight
on "Dead Files: Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,777
He said
that somebody pushed him.

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,344
...a second look at some

5
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:15,614
of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,849
- You think there's still
bodies there? - I do.

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,184
New information...

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,954
It actually makes you
feel helpless.

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,257
NARRATOR:
...startling revelations.

10
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,455
I thought,
"This is why he's so ill."

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,259
NARRATOR: First...
They typically kill people.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,095
...in Neosho, Missouri...

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,365
He just leaned in forward,
like, "I dare you."

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,818
...a menacing shadow...

15
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,202
Oh, no.
That's not good.

16
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,404
NARRATOR:
...leaves a family in pieces.

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,340
- I don't want my girls
to have a mixed-up life. - Then...

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,910
I think the house
is gonna kill us.

19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,411
...a return
to Starks, Maine...

20
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,949
It's almost like
nothing can live here.

21
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,018
...where failing health...

22
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,053
He should've broken
his neck.

23
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,221
...is no accident.

24
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,192
I've seen things
that I can't exactly explain.

25
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,328
Did they listen to Amy?

26
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,394
You're up
for the fight?

27
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,499
Or does the nightmare
continue?

28
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,037
WOMAN: In the name of
Jesus Christ, leave this house.

29
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,473
ALL: In the name of
Jesus Christ, leave this house.

30
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:17,259
It's really bad in here.

31
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,204
My name is Amy Allan.

32
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,114
Something is not right.

33
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,613
I see dead people.

34
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,951
This person might've been
a serial killer.

35
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,619
I speak to dead people.

36
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,288
You get those chills.

37
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,888
And they speak to me.

38
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,423
He is darkness. He is evil.

39
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,261
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

40
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,095
I think she broke her neck.

41
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,397
I rely on my partner.

42
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,664
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

43
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,268
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

44
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,268
You're telling me
the truth?

45
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,372
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

46
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,042
I think the devil
is down here.

47
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,327
It's my job to reveal them.

48
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:52,270
Who the hell
would do this?

49
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,179
But Steve and I never speak...

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,081
We never communicate
during an investigation.

51
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,433
...until the very end.

52
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:58,716
Who's he looking to kill?

53
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,902
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

54
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,054
You need to get out of here
right now.

55
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,155
Or time to get out.

56
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,026
It was, like,
endless darkness.

57
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,106
STEVE:
When a fellow cop called us here

58
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,309
to investigate his home
in Neosho, Missouri,

59
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,478
I knew he must be under
a lot of stress.

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,813
To go from protecting
your community all day

61
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,418
to your family all night,
that's got to break anyone down,

62
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,852
and as hard as Amy and I tried,

63
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,724
the outcome of this case still
doesn't sit right with me.

64
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:45,948
STEVE: Well, Dennis,
now, who exactly lives here?

65
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:50,069
My wife and her daughters
moved out two months ago.

66
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,369
We're separating.

67
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,772
Does it have anything to do
with the paranormal?

68
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,041
A lot of it did.

69
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,542
DENNIS:
What we were experiencing

70
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,978
was devastating
to myself and my family.

71
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,983
We were on the verge of divorce,
and it was very heartbreaking.

72
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,218
It made me feel just helpless.

73
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,454
So, give me an idea
about what's going on here.

74
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,523
Shadow figures,
scratching.

75
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,627
What are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

76
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,696
My wife and I are going
through some problems,

77
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:19,297
and we're hoping
to actually fix that

78
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,701
so we can stay here
and live in a loving family

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,471
without being frightened
for our lives.

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,148
AMY: While I often interact
with the dead

81
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,681
almost everywhere I go,

82
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:41,387
the overwhelming number
of entities in this neighborhood

83
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,474
was like nothing
I had ever seen before.

84
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:47,527
There's a lot of activity
around here.

85
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:50,061
[ Sighs ]

86
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:53,297
There's a lot of dead people
outside,

87
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:56,636
and they're talking
about the neighborhood.

88
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,708
Some guy is just like,
"Insanity and death."

89
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,846
DENNIS: I was inside
and saw a black figure

90
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,484
looking directly at me
through this window here.

91
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,285
Can you show me
what it looked like?

92
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,355
DENNIS: Being a fellow
law-enforcement officer,

93
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,390
when I first met Steve,
it was really a relief.

94
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,277
It was actually like
I was waiting for my backup.

95
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,839
I felt a little bit more calm
in the situation.

96
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:26,487
The shadow person came
from this direction.

97
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:29,101
He just leaned in forward,
like, "I dare you,"

98
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,004
and then just got up
after a second

99
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,174
and just walked
straight off.

100
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,645
AMY:
There is a darkness here.

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,451
It walks down the street.
It's not a person.

102
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,055
It's, like, a huge curtain
of darkness.

103
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,557
STEVE: As a former cop,
I know it's difficult

104
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,428
to balance your family life
with the demands of the job,

105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,981
but what Dennis told me
gave me a pretty good idea

106
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,500
of just how much pressure
this guy was really under.

107
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,500
I walked out
of the bathroom,

108
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:07,006
and I got struck from behind
by this very curtain rod,

109
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,406
right in the back.

110
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,708
What do you think's going on
in this house?

111
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,275
I wish I knew.

112
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,547
DENNIS: We were really unsure
if we were safe here.

113
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,299
You know,
you can take on a lot of things

114
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,017
that you can physically see,
hear, and touch,

115
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,350
but when you know

116
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,587
that it's really not something
of a human form,

117
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,788
it actually makes you
feel helpless.

118
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:29,828
I want to make sure that my wife
and my girls are safe here.

119
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,700
I love them.
I'm worried about it.

120
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,072
AMY:
Whatever this thing is...

121
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:47,347
it can, like,
do very physical things.

122
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:54,437
Grab people, move things,
and break things.

123
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:59,325
And this darkness
saturates the whole house.

124
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,262
STEVE:
Dennis' wife, Aundrea,

125
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,767
was still living in the house
after he'd moved out,

126
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,169
and their experiences
with the paranormal,

127
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,469
unfortunately helped me

128
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,974
establish a clear pattern
to the activity.

129
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,681
So, Aundrea,
have you experienced

130
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,186
anything paranormal in this
house, anything unusual?

131
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,656
With Dennis not being here,
I didn't feel safe at all.

132
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:35,378
I felt abandoned,
and I was facing the unknown.

133
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:40,066
I see a shadow man here
at the foot of my bed

134
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:44,669
staring down at me,
and I was petrified.

135
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,305
Okay. Now, is that the only
place you've seen him?

136
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,506
No.
I've seen him upstairs.

137
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,910
He was standing on the far side
of the bunk bed.

138
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,442
Okay.

139
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:55,181
So now you've got your little
girls you got to worry about.

140
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,247
It's very overwhelming.

141
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,068
I had a somewhat erratic
childhood.

142
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,854
Grandpa was the only father
I knew.

143
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,488
He died
when I was 7.

144
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,859
So, I don't want my girls
to have a mixed-up life.

145
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,161
- You said your grandfather died
when you were 7. - Yeah.

146
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,098
Do you remember much
about him?

147
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,033
He was amazing.

148
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,005
AUNDREA: Grandpa
was my everything growing up.

149
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,604
If I could talk to him,
I'd tell him

150
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,543
about his great-granddaughters
that he never got to meet.

151
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,913
I miss my grandfather
a lot.

152
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,648
Did he die young?

153
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,349
Yeah, he was only 58.

154
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,821
He died of -- Well, he died
of complications from chemo.

155
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,287
Okay.

156
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,492
I want to fix this
for my girls.

157
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,962
AMY: There's also, like,
a father figure

158
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,567
that's with her a lot.

159
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:51,102
And he's -- he's upset.

160
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:56,509
He said, "I told her when she
was younger to not do this."

161
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,295
What did he tell her
not to do?

162
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,046
Be into all this dark stuff.

163
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,715
But I'm trying to tell him

164
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,519
the darkness
pretty much goes everywhere.

165
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,289
That's why she has to deal
with this ****

166
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,289
It's at this point
that I realize

167
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,558
the old man wasn't the source
of danger here.

168
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:18,731
Unfortunately, the problem was
much worse than I had feared.

169
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,131
What I see here is this thing

170
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,603
standing at the end of the bed,
really big.

171
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,040
And I think
there's a closet connection.

172
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:32,609
Oh, no.
This looks like a shadow man.

173
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:37,416
They typically kill people,
the shadow people.

174
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,583
NARRATOR: Next...

175
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,786
Hit him in the head
and killed him instantly.

176
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,086
...evil knows no bounds.

177
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,224
This darkness,
it walks down the street.

178
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,360
NARRATOR: And in our
second investigation...

179
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,294
It felt like
we were under siege.

180
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,598
NARRATOR:...the living
fight for survival.

181
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,500
This is, like,
the house of the dead.

182
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,484
STEVE: In a close-knit community
like Neosho,

183
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,720
sometimes the neighbors
know more

184
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,921
about your own business
than you do,

185
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,825
and after talking to a woman
who had lived nearby,

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,060
whatever was going on
in my client's house

187
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,031
didn't sound
like an isolated case.

188
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,738
I had some unusual things
happen at my house.

189
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,172
Like what?

190
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,842
There was a dark streak
that would go

191
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,575
from the top of the ceiling

192
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,012
down almost all the way
to the floor,

193
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,515
and I painted over it,
and I papered over it,

194
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,051
and it would just inevitably
come back every time.

195
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,854
Really?
Even with the wallpaper?

196
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,423
Even the wallpaper.

197
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,860
AMY:
When I started my walk,

198
00:09:55,895 --> 00:10:00,199
I saw this darkness
that walks down the street.

199
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,401
It'll come right in the door,

200
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:08,507
and there were little people
or something in it,

201
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,511
and there's panic
because of this.

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,813
STEVE: At this point
in my investigation,

203
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,418
it seemed like the
whole neighborhood
could've used our help,

204
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,451
but after digging
through the archives,

205
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:24,189
I came across some info that
set my client's house apart.

206
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,443
Not only did a brothel operate
on the land,

207
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:30,696
but a violent murder
took place there in 1875.

208
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,107
One of the rooms was leased
to Lizzie Sanford,

209
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,409
and she opened a brothel
there in Neosho.

210
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:49,881
This area, it has this sadness.

211
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,617
A desperate sadness.

212
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:54,851
She was entertaining

213
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:57,739
a 17-year-old young man
named Lane Britton,

214
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,557
and another young man
named Wiley Huffaker

215
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:03,462
demanded entrance and
started pounding on the door,

216
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,082
and Lane Britton threatened
to shoot him.

217
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:08,877
And Wiley said,
"Well, shooter be damned."

218
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:11,608
AMY: At one point,
I did hear a gunshot,

219
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,305
and I heard somebody saying,
"Ha ha ha.

220
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,173
That little ****
had it coming to him."

221
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,476
And Lane took him up on it
and shot through the door

222
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,514
and hit him in the head and
apparently killed him instantly.

223
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,318
AMY:
I just hear crying, whimpers.

224
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,689
People -- they, like, die.

225
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,790
STEVE: The brothel shooting
was a solid start,

226
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,662
but Dennis and Aundrea
had reported so much activity,

227
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,781
I was determined to make sure
I didn't overlook

228
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,866
any other secrets
buried in their property.

229
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,499
So, I hit the hall of records

230
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,988
and came across a woman
named Emma Mae Liebhart,

231
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,442
who died from lung cancer
in the house in 1938.

232
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,182
AMY: I'm seeing
the crying woman again.

233
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,718
Do you know
how she died?

234
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:05,324
I think it was some kind
of respiratory thing.

235
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:11,095
Mm.

236
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,750
I think this is the woman
from outside,

237
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:18,479
and she spent a lot of time
in here,

238
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:22,174
and she doesn't want
to be bothered

239
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,810
by these things anymore.

240
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,213
What things?

241
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,582
This darkness.

242
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,088
I mean, she calls them
little monsters.

243
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,342
Now that I had spoken
to a few of the dead here,

244
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,128
I was sure that they weren't
the ones causing harm.

245
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,347
They were the victims.

246
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:47,497
I think she kind of feels

247
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:50,302
like they did contribute
to her death.

248
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,638
They, like, attack her.

249
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,908
NARRATOR: Coming up...

250
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,142
That picture kills me.

251
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,311
...what happened
after the investigation?

252
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,880
You're not welcome
in this house. Leave this house.

253
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:07,153
ALL: You're not welcome in
this house. Leave this house.

254
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,946
STEVE: Amy, I'd like you
to meet Dennis and Aundrea.

255
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,016
When the reveal started,
I was an absolute wreck.

256
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,916
Aundrea and I,
we were ready to hear

257
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,118
what was going on in the house,

258
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,684
but at the same time,

259
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,356
I was really, really nervous
of what Amy would find.

260
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,191
STEVE: When the two of them
called us in,

261
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,458
they were living together.

262
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,362
Unfortunately,
the activity drove them apart.

263
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,548
So, Dennis
no longer lives here,

264
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,699
but he doesn't think it's safe

265
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,402
for Aundrea and the kids
to be here,

266
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,636
and he called for our help.

267
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:05,710
When I first pulled up to
the house, I was like, "Whoa."

268
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,578
It's not just this house.

269
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:11,482
There's activity everywhere
in this neighborhood.

270
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,752
AUNDREA:
When I found out that my
neighbors might be in jeopardy,

271
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,520
it just frightened me.

272
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,141
I don't want anybody else
to ever go through this.

273
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,727
I actually spoke to one
of their former neighbors,

274
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,294
and it was her opinion

275
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,464
that a lot of the houses here
had activity.

276
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,404
AMY: I was outside,
and I saw two men,

277
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,839
and I heard a gunshot.

278
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,710
Okay. At one time, your property
had a brothel on it.

279
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,311
Really?

280
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,681
It was run by a woman
named Lizzie Sanford,

281
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,016
and one night she was
entertaining a young guy

282
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,752
by the name
of Lane Britton.

283
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,388
The guy on the left.

284
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,288
Another guy by the name
of Wiley Huffaker

285
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,360
came up to the door and
was drunk, demanded to get in.

286
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,296
And this kid puts one round
through the door

287
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,733
and catches him in the head,
kills him instantly.

288
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,035
Oh, my gosh.

289
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:12,343
I went in the master bedroom,
and I met a male.

290
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:16,015
He seems to be
some type of father figure.

291
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,417
And he feels
that his baby's gone downhill,

292
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,324
but on the other hand,
he does love this person.

293
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,558
That would make me think
it was Grandpa.

294
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:32,213
He died when I was 7.
He'd had prostate cancer.

295
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,834
[ Voice breaking ]
His death affected me badly.

296
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,338
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,675
When Amy told me
about my grandfather,

298
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,409
it broke my heart

299
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:49,948
'cause he's not supposed to
be down here guarding me.

300
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,714
He's supposed to be in Heaven.

301
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:57,822
This individual is here
because he is protection.

302
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,992
From what?

303
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,162
Well, in the bedroom
downstairs,

304
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,132
I saw
this shadow person.

305
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,971
It is
extremely dangerous.

306
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,040
Then I went
into the pink room.

307
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,742
That's Danielle's room.

308
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,259
Yeah.

309
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:18,742
Okay.

310
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,577
And I saw the shadow man

311
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:26,517
crawling out of the closet,
going towards the bed.

312
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,053
My goodness.

313
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,090
I've seen him at the foot
of my bed downstairs.

314
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,125
I see him
all over the place.

315
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,930
DENNIS: It makes us worry
for our safety here,

316
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,700
but it also pissed me off
because I felt helpless.

317
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:46,004
What can I do
to protect our daughter?

318
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,308
Well, I did do a sketch
of what I saw.

319
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,597
Crawling towards the bed
from the closet.

320
00:16:55,632 --> 00:17:00,018
And there's a kid
sleeping in the bed.

321
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,021
He's creepy.

322
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,463
- STEVE: That's your daughter's room.
- Yeah.

323
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,968
That picture kills me.

324
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:23,108
AUNDREA: When I saw the picture
of the shadow person,

325
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,409
I went into shock.

326
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,579
I was horrified at the fact

327
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:33,001
that I haven't been
protecting her like I should.

328
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:36,353
That's disturbing.
It bothers me a great deal.

329
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:42,793
I love this family, and I don't
want anything to harm them.

330
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:46,264
So, question is,
what the hell is going on here?

331
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,967
There must be
some specific location

332
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,702
in this neighborhood,

333
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,872
some type of doorway,
where the shadow people

334
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,910
and little humanoid creatures
I saw are coming from.

335
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,011
And these things
can kill?

336
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,812
Yes.

337
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,413
Oh, my gosh.

338
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,084
I got to keep my girls safe.

339
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,685
They're everything to me.

340
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,991
This is the last thing
that I wanted it to be.

341
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,626
You can't fight this,
can you?

342
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,694
No.

343
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,197
That's what we needed
to know, though.

344
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,470
Knowing that none of us are safe
in our own home

345
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:28,074
and we have to get out,
it's disturbing.

If we move out of here,
can this follow us?

No.

00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:35,362
There's a lot of people
who think

that shadow people
can be dealt with.

almost immediately that night,

00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,174
my wife and I talked.

We decided we'd loved
each other enough,

I feel a whole lot safer
with him here.

359
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,294
We started weighing our options.

360
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,061
We listed the house

DENNIS:
Since we are still here,

and since we haven't found
a house to move in yet,

364
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,646
we thought it best if we contact
a spiritual advisor

365
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,850
to come in and see if she can
bless and cleanse the house.

366
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,020
AUNDREA: The first thing
the spiritual advisor had us do

367
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,687
was open all the windows
in the house.

368
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,508
She said that when
we're cleansing the house,

369
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:56,295
it would help push
the negative energy out.

370
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,200
DENNIS: The second thing
the spiritual advisor did

371
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,267
was bless Aundrea and I.

with the sage stick,

377

we used holy water and we went
around all of the entryways --

378
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:30,060
doors, windows --
and blessed them

379
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,264

from any negative energy

ALL: By the grace of the Lord,
this house is protected.

Our next step was to actually
try and just cleanse the house.

We walked around the house,

and we were told to ring a bell.

388
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:58,189

AUNDREA:
It really is wonderful to
have the family back together,

00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,712
and a little bit colder,
and finally we just set it down,

518
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,314
put the lights on.

519
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,846
It was very shocking.

520
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:34,419
I'm not in the business
of taking things at face value,

521
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:37,038
so even though Adam
looks pretty shook up,

522
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,588
I needed to push him
for more details.

523
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,792
So, let me get this straight.
Were you doing that here?

524
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:42,410
Yeah.

525
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:43,503
Where?

526
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,527
Upstairs.

527
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,562
In which room?

528
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,929
In my aunt's room.

529
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:48,765
Does your aunt know about
this cross thing you did?

530
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,967
Yeah, she's not happy.

531
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,335
- You blame her?
- No.

532
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,238
You know, I think your aunt
has a right to be mad at you.

533
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,140
Yeah.
I think so, too.

534
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,144
Yeah, so --
She's a sweet lady, so...

535
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,444
- I know. I love her very dearly.
- Okay.

536
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,983
It does sometimes feel like
we're up against something,

537
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,618
and I'm scared of it.

538
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,991
AMY: There's just
some weird **** going on.

539
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:18,063
Really strange stuff.

540
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,896
There's, like --

541
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:24,802
Somebody's doing, like,
all these séances and stuff,

542
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,303
but there's --

543
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,105
But they shouldn't be,
and they know it.

544
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,344
This whole walk, I was picking
up on the living and the dead.

545
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,864
I was getting
really disoriented,

546
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:39,593
but then I noticed
a common thread.

547
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:42,559
This is a very angry,
fearful house.

548
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:45,490
Everybody's confused
in this place.

549
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,809
It's like a frickin' madhouse.

550
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:50,094
Did they
just dig the body up?

551
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,126
NARRATOR: Next...

552
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,628
They're discarded people.

553
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,467
NARRATOR:...some secrets
can't stay buried.

554
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:58,303
Some of the bones
were left behind.

555
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,770
STEVE: My client's whole family
was facing health problems,

556
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:20,157
so I hit the archives to see
if the past held any clues.

557
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,626
While there,
I found the previous owner,

558
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,562
who had his own problems.

559
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:34,303
Angier was
a pretty prosperous guy.

560
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:37,274
He had been given the farm
by his siblings

561
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,610
after his father died,
but with a condition.

562
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,914
He had to support
his brother, George,

563
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,514
who was
mentally disabled.

564
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,653
In 1911, George
physically assaults Angier.

565
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,687
He leaves.

566
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,858
Angier closes the door
and never allows George back.

567
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,225
Wow.

568
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,030
And Angier was estranged
from the family after that.

569
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:02,031
Now, do you know
what he died of?

570
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,036
He died, in the house
you're investigating,

571
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,389
of apoplexy,
which is a stroke.

572
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:09,672
Ernie, let me ask you
a question.

573
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,108
I know a lot of people
were buried on the property

574
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,310
they lived on
back in those days.

575
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,044
What about Angier?

576
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,377
He wouldn't
have been buried there,

577
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,147
but there is something
you might want to know --

578
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,216
is that the house
that you're investigating

579
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,085
is either adjacent to
or encroaches on

580
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,521
an old village
burial ground.

581
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,759
Really? Okay.

582
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:35,216
There was this man,
and he was mean.

583
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:39,869
He looks like an undertaker,
just nasty.

584
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,257
But, like, he's very much
a part of this house.

585
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:46,610
I think he was kind of deserted
by his family.

586
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,513
Okay.

587
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,384
He's all alone.

588
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,788
He was bad.

589
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,526
STEVE:
Learning about the property's
previous owner was helpful,

590
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,359
but that historian
gave me a lead

591
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:07,664
that proved to be a big
turning point in this case.

592
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,934
When it comes to finding out
about my client's land,

593
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,271
I rarely get a break like this.

594
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,548
So, Paul, is it true that
the house I'm investigating,

595
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,516
there might've been a graveyard
either under it

596
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,851
or at least
right next to it?

597
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,384
Yes, that's true.

598
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,956
In fact, my
great-great-great-grandfather

599
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,123
was originally
buried there.

600
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,392
- He died in 1822.
- Okay.

601
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,861
And he was reburied
in this cemetery.

602
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:41,698
All right, so,
when did this take place?

603
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,534
I have a map here
of the village in 1860.

604
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:48,671
And you can see
there's a cemetery marked

605
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,275
adjacent to the home
that you are investigating.

606
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,345
This is the corner, and this
is the cemetery right here.

607
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,145
Okay.

608
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,049
And, uh, this is an 1883 map
of the same area,

609
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,918
and you can see there's
no cemetery at that site.

610
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,621
Okay. So, we know it had to
happen between those two times.

611
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,655
That's right.

612
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,656
So, how did
the moving process work?

613
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,461
I mean, did they just
dig the body up and...?

614
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,761
Well,
they did in some cases,

615
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:16,166
and in other cases, the bodies
may have not been relocated.

616
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,469
They may still be
in the ground there.

617
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:28,879
Somehow, these people
are dying here, or died here.

618
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,447
It's their -- It's their place.

619
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:33,882
The dead were just all over me,

620
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,553
each one trying
to share their agony with me.

621
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,024
I couldn't make out one voice
from the next,

622
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,126
so instead of telling me
about it,

623
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,393
they tried to make me feel it.

624
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:48,232
Like, you can't escape
their pain.

625
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,368
It just is not good.

626
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,039
Now, would they ever move
a headstone and not the body?

627
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,407
- Yes. Headstones are easy to move.
- Right.

628
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:00,876
Bodies are
much more difficult.

629
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:02,946
I don't think that they were
very well taken care of

630
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,647
when they died.

631
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,950
And some of the bones

632
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,553
were, in all likelihood,
left behind.

633
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:13,757
You know that they are,
like, the true lost souls,

634
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,760
the ones that people
have forgotten about

635
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,661
or turned their backs on.

636
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,830
- Do you think there's
still bodies there? - I do.

637
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,969
Uh, they were discarded.
They're discarded people.

638
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,187
NARRATOR: Next...

639
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:27,336
I was just shocked.

640
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,940
...dark secrets
come to light.

641
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,474
Scares me to death,
really.

642
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,279
I really feel like this house
is trying to kill us.

643
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,547
NARRATOR:
Can this home be saved?

644
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:42,153
WOMAN: Sadness,
confusion, fear, let go.

645
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:08,978
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Ann Marie and her nephew, Adam.

646
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,449
Ann Marie actually lives here
with her elderly parents.

647
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,417
She believes
that whatever's in this house

648
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,285
is making them all very sick

649
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,389
and is possibly trying
to kill them.

650
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,492
AMY: This was the first time
on a walk

651
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,994
that I almost didn't make it
all the way through.

652
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:29,733
ANN MARIE: When Amy told me she
almost couldn't finish her walk,

653
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,600
I was just shocked.

654
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:35,537
I couldn't imagine
what she was gonna say next.

655
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:40,710
I was overwhelmed with how many
dead were located here.

656
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:43,746
STEVE: I may have
an explanation.

657
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:48,719
This house is either built on
or literally right next door...

658
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,186
...to what used to be
a graveyard. - Wow.

659
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:54,525
There's just so much stuff
they didn't tell us

660
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,124
about this house
before we bought it.

661
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,662
I'd be really mad about that
if I were you.

662
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,596
It really pisses me off.

663
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,732
We would've
never bought this house

664
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,369
if we knew it was built
on the site of a cemetery.

665
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,672
It's a house
full of dead people.

666
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,940
They don't want
living people here.

667
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,243
There's one male
that's here,

668
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:17,946
and he is not okay.

669
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:21,784
He just seemed
extremely unwell to me,

670
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,457
but he was very much estranged
from his family.

671
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,526
There was a guy
named Angier Gray.

672
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:30,526
He lived and died
in this house.

673
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,631
He died of apoplexy,
which is a stroke.

674
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,567
And you said he was estranged
from the family.

675
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:41,104
Angier had to take care
of his younger brother, George,

676
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,538
who was
mentally handicapped,

677
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,940
but George got into
a physical fight with him

678
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:48,528
and left the house, and Angier
never let him back in.

679
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,082
That's where the estrangement
comes with the family.

680
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,384
This is how he looked.

681
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:58,022
Amy, do you think
this is the guy you saw?

682
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,391
Yeah.

683
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,260
Can we be influenced
by him?

684
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:08,199
I think that's
a huge possibility, yes.

685
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,805
I did do a sketch of the dead
down here in this room.

686
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,210
They were congregating,
and it was all around the bed.

687
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:23,548
That's where
Ann Marie's dad sleeps.

688
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,582
Right.

689
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,020
Just don't freak out.
Just...

690
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,223
Oh, my God.

691
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,332
When I saw the sketch
of the people

692
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,535
that were surrounding
my father's bed,

693
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,669
I thought
this is why he's so ill.

694
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:51,541
These are the people who
feel lost, who feel discarded.

695
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:55,379
They're trying to become,
like, these inhuman creatures.

696
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:58,281
Now,
one of the main reasons --

697
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,915
Her breaking point
for calling us in

698
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,186
is an incident that happened
here with her father.

699
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,785
Tell her what happened.

700
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,458
My father fell down the stairs
backwards, headfirst.

701
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,158
Oh, my gosh.

702
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:14,065
And when we got to the hospital,
he said he was pushed.

703
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,500
Could they have pushed
her father down the stairs?

704
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,935
I think so.

705
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,707
I really feel like this house
is trying to kill us.

706
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,144
You know, you feel bad for them
that they were stuck here

707
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,812
and their graves were desecrated
and stuff,

708
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,699
but I don't want them
to kill my family, either.

709
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:34,585
They told me they won't allow
anything to live here.

710
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,153
Nothing.

711
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,087
It scares me to death, really.

712
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:42,225
It's so hard to live
in this house.

713
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,429
Yeah, it just feels like
it never lets up.

714
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,901
Ann Marie,
now you know why your family's

715
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,970
been going through hell
since you've been here.

716
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,872
The question is,
how do you fix it?

717
00:37:55,873 --> 00:38:00,477
What I'm going to say,
it's kind of difficult for me,

718
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,314
because they kind of
damned themselves.

719
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:06,116
They've done that
via attempted murder.

720
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,749
We have to proceed

721
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:12,421
as if they were some type
of a demonic presence.

722
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:17,628
They are not demons, but they
have become a type of evil.

723
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:21,196
The first thing
is to move them on,

724
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:23,732
and it has to be
a religious, holy person.

725
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:27,270
So, you know, it could be
a minister, a priest.

726
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,972
You know, whatever you feel
comfortable with.

727
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,572
The other thing is,

728
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:33,411
is that you are going to
have to have an exorcism done.

729
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,283
Of the land and the house.

730
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,452
You're up
for the fight?

731
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:02,538
ANN MARIE:
Amy told me to take care of the
dead on the property right away,

732
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,639
so immediately after
the investigation,

733
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:07,208
I started looking for someone
who could help.

734
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:10,548
I need our health to improve.
I need to get it done.

735
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,288
My goal was to get
an exorcism done.

736
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,255
I couldn't find anybody
to do that,

737
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,627
but I did find someone
who had a different approach.

738
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,461
So, I'm bringing in
a spiritual healer,

739
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:29,767
someone who will facilitate
people moving on

740
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,535
and do it in a peaceful way.

741
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,310
The first thing she did
was lay directional stones

742
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:42,078
to point the energy outward.

743
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,148
WOMAN: Making an offering
to the land here.

744
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,251
There's a healing energy
available

745
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:48,319
for the spirit world
and the land.

746
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,126
ANN MARIE:
She got her smudge pot,

747
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,861
and she smudged
the outside of the house.

748
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:05,002
WOMAN: Spirits of sadness,
confusion, fear, let go.

749
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,839
ANN MARIE: The healer came in

750
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,909
and mixed some herbs that
were specific to this house.

751
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,981
She burned the herbs, and she
smudged every room in the house

752
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,818
to help clear
the negative energy.

753
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,585
As the healer
walked through my house,

754
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,056
I was starting
to feel more and more hopeful

755
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,359
that things could improve.

756
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,333
WOMAN: Spirits, it's important
for you to release your sadness.

757
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,142
ANN MARIE: After the healer
cleansed the home,

758
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:48,043
she did a Reiki healing on me.

759
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,678
WOMAN:
There's a strong connection

760
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,616
between the physical world
and the spiritual world

761
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,484
which is made stronger
by coming from the heart.

762
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,787
ANN MARIE: During the Reiki
healing, I could feel my pain

763
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,991
sort of rising to the surface
and disappearing.

764
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,762
Do your elbows
bother you?

765
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,929
This one.

766
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,865
That's where
we hold anger.

767
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,398
I was really hoping

768
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:13,804
that this would help
the situation quite a bit.

769
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,540
You have a beautiful glow
around you.

770
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,015
After the house was cleansed,

771
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,886
I noticed a significant
difference in the way it felt.

772
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,723
I already feel a difference
in the energy in this house,

773
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:39,730
but I'm still going to look
for an exorcist in the meantime.

774
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:43,231
Since the investigation,

775
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,836
my father has returned home
from the hospital,

776
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,739
and he is currently stable.

777
00:41:47,774 --> 00:41:49,572
He's been able to stay home.

778
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,442
He hasn't been hospitalized
again since then.

779
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:56,579
He's doing pretty good.

780
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,364
How are you doing?

781
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,079
Thank you. Good.

782
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,749
Yeah?
You having a good day?

783
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,384
Yep.
Doing all right today.

784
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,588
The most important thing
is my parents' health.

785
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:08,309
Having them safe
is my number-one priority.

786
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:11,995
So, I'm not sure
if we still need an exorcism,

787
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,231
but time will tell.

788
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,268
AMY: I'm really glad
that Ann Marie

789
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,855
was able to get some form
of help so quickly,

790
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,407
but since her family's
well-being is on the line,

791
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,411
I hope she finds an exorcist
immediately.
