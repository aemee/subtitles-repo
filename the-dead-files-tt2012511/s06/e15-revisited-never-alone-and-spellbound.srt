When a mother in Forester,

was strong,

to entertain herself

00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,121
Are you afraid of her?

179
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,058
I'm not really allowed
to talk about it.

180
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,306
STEVE: Our client, Chrystal, had
mentioned a rumor

181
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,707
about a local woman
who had died.

182
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,674
At first, I didn't think
too much of it.

183
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,980
Chasing urban legends usually
leads straight to a dead end.

184
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,747
But allegedly, this went down

185
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,851
right across the street
from her house,

186
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,184
and digging a little deeper,

187
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,219
it turned out
that this tragic story

188
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,323
was much more than just
an old wives' tale.

189
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,799
My client mentioned a legend
about this girl, Minnie Quay,

190
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,199
that killed herself.

191
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,636
I need to find out from you
if it's true or not.

192
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,601
Oh, it's true.

193
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,338
Here is
her death certificate.

194
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,274
Suicide by drowning.

195
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,978
So, what can you tell me
about her?

196
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,648
You know, Minnie
was a 15-year-old girl

197
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,014
who was boy-crazy.

198
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,018
She fell in love
with a sailor.

199
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,271
She would
secretly meet him.

200
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,455
And her parents found out.

201
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,724
And they forbade her
to see this sailor.

202
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,229
When the shipping season
reopened again in April,

203
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,032
she found out
that he was lost at sea.

204
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,732
She was devastated.

205
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,536
And so, on April 27, 1876,

206
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,271
eyewitnesses said that

207
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,939
she walked down the length
of the pier

208
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:42,114
and jumped into the frigid,
icy water of Lake Huron.

209
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:49,488
Now, are we talking about
the pier a few hundred yards...

210
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,455
...from the house
I'm investigating? - Correct.

211
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,557
It's painful
to jump in icy water.

212
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,995
And once the core temperature
begins to drop,

213
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,396
the systems begin to fail.

214
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:03,135
AMY:
I'm just hearing this woman.

215
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,269
There's a woman crying.

216
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,039
During a walk, sometimes
I just have to let the dead

217
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,473
lead the way around the house.

218
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,277
And in this case,
they guided me out of the house

219
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,014
and across the street towards
the water.

220
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,651
It's just a girl.

221
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,453
It's just a girl.

222
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,658
To be honest, part of me wished
it were possible

223
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,526
for me to jump in there
and help her.

224
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:31,429
The girl who's sad is lost,

225
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,330
and then this woman's

226
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,067
yelling, yelling, yelling
for her.

227
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,103
Lots of people are yelling.

228
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:43,308
I can't -- I can't reach it.

229
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,444
I can't, uh...

230
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,979
breathe.

231
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,549
I think she's dying.

232
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,353
STEVE: As I combed through
the archives,

233
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,257
I uncovered a series of
mysterious deaths in Forester.

234
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,491
Strange enough, they all
came back to one name --

235
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,796
Harrison Cooper, the man
who owned Chrystal's property.

236
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,264
And once I sat down
with a local genealogist,

237
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,468
I learned that piece of land had
death written all over it.

238
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,746
STEVE: I came across
the name Harrison Cooper.

239
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,550
And I know he lived in
the property I'm investigating.

240
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,219
He lived there
with his wife, Elizabeth,

241
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,888
and they had a daughter.

242
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,522
- Her name was Emma Jay.
- Okay.

243
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,694
And then the fire of 1881
wiped out everything.

244
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,194
A week after that,

245
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,797
Elizabeth had a heart attack
and died.

246
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,834
So now, Harrison
is left with his daughter.

247
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,602
Oh, geez.

248
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,770
Now, how does he move on?
What happened?

249
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,407
His daughter Emma
and her husband lived with them.

250
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,743
Then, in 1903,
another tragedy struck.

251
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,315
Emma gave birth,
but the baby was stillborn.

252
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,285
- Now loses a grandchild.
- Yes.

253
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,642
There's a woman crying.

254
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:09,428
Real, real, like, sobbing.

255
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,727
She's sobbing.

256
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:12,631
And then somebody says,
"Well, the baby died."

257
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,969
It's horrible.

258
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,889
She's holding the dead baby.

259
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,739
She's, like, petting it.

260
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,778
And then she's got blood
all over her dress.

261
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,447
This lady, she's fading.

262
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:34,652
But she doesn't want
to fade away.

263
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,856
For that woman, the memory of
her infant's death

264
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,991
was the only remaining part
of her humanity,

265
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,262
and even though it pained her
to focus on that moment in time,

266
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,464
she just wasn't ready to let go.

267
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,666
She actually doesn't want to

268
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,104
because she likes
to be around those memories,

269
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,290
even though they're bad.

270
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,442
So she's trying to hold on.

271
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,261
She doesn't want to leave.

272
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,547
NARRATOR: Coming up...

273
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,449
Is he dangerous?

274
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,518
What happened after
the investigation?

275
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,019
I was prepared
for the worst.

276
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,905
It is time for you to go.

277
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,757
Move forward to the light.

278
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,149
STEVE:
Amy, this is Chrystal,

279
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:42,988
Brittany, their daughter,
and Mike, her husband.

280
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,374
CHRYSTAL:
The night of the reveal,

281
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,885
I didn't know
what Amy was gonna say,

282
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,327
but I was prepared
for the worst.

283
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,763
Chrystal's mom had
a dream of turning this place

284
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,799
into a bed-and-breakfast,
and she'd like to do the same.

285
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,834
I went across the street.

286
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,871
and all of a sudden, I felt
like somebody had just died.

287
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,205
I'm feeling this girl,

288
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,743
and I'm hearing this woman
calling,

289
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,845
"Where are you?
Where are you?"

290
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,913
And when I came
back into the house

291
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,413
there was a girl,

292
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:13,251
and she was very much
the black sheep of the family.

293
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,254
Who does that sound like?

294
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,588
Yeah. Minnie Quay.

295
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,721
Huh?

296
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,757
It was a town legend
that she killed herself.

297
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,791
She was 15 years old.

298
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,160
She threw herself in the river...

299
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,896
...because she was in a relationship
with a merchant sailor. - Oh, man.

300
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,397
But the father
was very strict.

301
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,899
He thought this sailor
was beneath her.

302
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,969
She was capable of having
physical interaction.

303
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,508
And she likes to get reactions
for her behaviors.

304
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,312
One time the door slammed
upstairs

305
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,747
so hard the whole house shook.

306
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,666
Oh, my gosh.

307
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,515
It's the girl.

308
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,520
Could that be Minnie Quay,
the same girl?

309
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,521
I think
it very well could be.

310
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,360
CHRYSTAL: This has been told
to us since we were kids.

311
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,193
And to be perfectly honest,

312
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,229
I actually really don't care
if she's here,

313
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,696
but she needs to behave.

314
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,700
If she's causing issues,
then yeah, she needs to go.

315
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,670
When I went upstairs,
I heard this woman sobbing --

316
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,604
really crying.

317
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,376
I heard someone say,
"Well, the baby died."

318
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,911
I saw blood all over her.

319
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,111
Ah, geez.

320
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,746
This guy, Harrison Cooper,

321
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,685
when he moved to this property,
his daughter, Emma Jay,

322
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,054
she wound up
having a stillborn baby here.

323
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:26,274
The baby's probably buried on
the property.

324
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,226
So you're saying
you think that it's Emma?

325
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,494
It would seem like it.

326
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,165
CHRYSTAL: I just felt sad
that Emma was still here,

327
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,801
trapped here, and grieving over
the loss of her baby.

328
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,071
That's when I knew we needed
to do something.

329
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,191
So I'm doing my opening,

330
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:46,276
and there's this man

331
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:50,048
that came into my body
and meshed.

332
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,050
What did he look like?

333
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,018
A big guy, very husky.

334
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,770
I've seen a man.

335
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,488
It's a dark shadow.

[ Sobs ]

337
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,060
Are you okay?
Yeah? All right.

[ Sniffles ]

339
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,297
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

340
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:08,766
Say, you're sleeping.

341
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,703
The distinction
between reality and dreams

342
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,904
can get blurred.

343
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,007
She's having nightmares.

344
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,041
I do.

345
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,562
BRITTANY: When Amy said
that she had seen a man,

346
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:24,082
it caught me off guard because
I see a male figure,

347
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,617
and I got upset because

348
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,054
I was almost happy
she had seen the same thing

349
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,423
so she could tell me
if it was dangerous.

350
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,326
I went into a room
with a pink bed.

351
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,228
Then I'm looking,

352
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,066
and I see these two dark things
in each corner.

353
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,599
They're very tall,

354
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,154
and I felt like
they were trying

355
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,675
to reach something
or someone.

It's these
two black things.

363
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,509
They're looking
at whoever's on the bed,

364

and they're
on each side of the room.

00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,578
Now...

366
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,983
does this look similar
to what you saw in the doorway?

367
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,469
BRITTANY: Yeah.

can make you feel sick
and dizzy and nauseous,

Oh, yeah.

are still lurking around
and watching you.

391
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,415
The big question is,
is it safe for you to stay,

392
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,515
and can you fulfill
your mom's dream?

393
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,155
Well, the first thing
is that you do need a medium

394
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,225
to come back
and help to move Minnie on.

395
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,325
After doing that,

396
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,796
that medium needs to go up
into your room

and deal with
this funky emotional energy

that needs to be contained
and removed from the house.

would be for you

to go ahead and sleep
in another area of the house.

it was awful.

you're really not supposed to
mess around with this stuff,

something that we could do,

wanted to harm her family,

come down here.

just dread,
sadness, pain.

walked across the floor

694
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,150
TYSHA: When I first met Amy,
I was terrified

695
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,252
of what she was gonna tell us,

696
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,853
and I just had a gut-wrenching
kind of feeling

697
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,424
that it wasn't gonna be your
average paranormal activity,

698
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:58,229
and I kind of knew it was
gonna be pretty traumatic.

699
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:02,732
When I was upstairs,
I did meet two sisters.

700
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,669
They owned this property
at some point in time.

701
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,973
One of the sisters
had children who died.

702
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,625
And I think
that if people see them,

703
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,208
they're just kind of like
a mist.

704
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,746
The mist I've seen has been
kind of a black-color mist.

705
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,313
Okay.

706
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,316
STEVE: There was a guy
named Starke Robinson

707
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,051
who bought the house in 1870.

708
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,685
He moved here
with his wife, Ellen,

709
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,786
who, within a year,
actually passed away.

710
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:28,192
About five years later,
he married her sister,

711
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,160
Elizabeth,
who died in this house.

712
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,995
This guy had 14 children,

713
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,032
seven of them which died
before he did.

714
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,131
Geez.

715
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:39,134
What else did you see?

716
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,770
So, when I went
into the basement,

717
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:45,741
I saw 4 to 10 black men
that were dead.

718
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,044
Back in its heyday,
this was a tobacco plantation.

719
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:50,880
Hmm.

720
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,683
And the basement
of this house

721
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,416
was slaves' living quarters.

722
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:56,387
To tell you
how they were treated and --

723
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:57,755
I know
how they were treated.

724
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,326
I sketched
that scene in the basement.

725
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:08,065
There were
several dead black men laying.

726
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,266
There's two black women.

727
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,138
They're pouring water
on the bodies.

728
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,041
Take a look at that.

729
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:20,978
Wow.

730
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,814
It's sad to see that
in the picture.

731
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,482
It's sickening to me.

732
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,952
It was such a powerful scene,

733
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,989
and seeing that sketch
flooded me

734
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,956
with so many different emotions

735
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,226
because now we're
the ones being picked on

736
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,028
and tortured and punished.

737
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,129
Well, the thing is,

738
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,202
is that the larger lady
is still down there.

739
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,539
She doesn't want
anybody in there,

740
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,040
especially
if they're white.

741
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:55,412
I'd never felt hatred like that
from an entity in my life.

742
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,647
And then she showed me
children

743
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:01,301
and said that they were
the only good thing in her life.

744
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:03,920
Of a slave that used to live
here by the name of Louisa.

745
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,458
She had this child that was
half black, half white,

746
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:10,193
and they took a big chance
and they ran away.

747
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,896
Her presence
is extremely dangerous

748
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,398
and incredibly powerful.

749
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:19,737
She's also trying
to give you guys warnings

750
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,637
to get out.

751
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,139
TROY:
Yeah, I was really nervous,

752
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,943
and heart beating fast because
this is my house.

753
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,614
This is a place that I've been
in since I was a little boy,

754
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:34,251
and while it's under my watch,
I'm not abandoning my place.

755
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:38,021
She is
the hoodoo practitioner.

756
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,322
What is hoodoo?

757
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,425
Hoodoo comes from Africa.

758
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,331
It is not a religion,
but a system to place spells.

759
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:53,203
And she put them into place
while she was alive

760
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,503
to ensure things would go

761
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,472
the way she wanted them to
in death.

762
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,777
'Cause hoodoo
is all about gaining power.

763
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:02,377
And now she's got
all this power --

764
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:04,415
she's got all these dead people
that she controls.

765
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,551
What does she want
from them?

766
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,223
She wants the house
demolished.

767
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,361
That ain't gonna happen.

768
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,281
All of the dead
want it gone.

769
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:24,200
So, how many ghosts
do we have?

770
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,270
I would say hundreds.

771
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,739
We've tried to protect
this place,

772
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,977
and everybody's tried to be
respectful to the place.

773
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,444
You're white.

774
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,115
She won't listen
to what you're saying.

775
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:43,920
There's terrible things
that happen in the house,

776
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:47,156
and I don't blame her
for one bit feeling that way,

777
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,927
but we're not the ones
who did this to them,

778
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,360
and I definitely don't think

779
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,631
that we should be the ones
suffering for it.

780
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,602
So, is it safe for you
to stay on your property

781
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:01,304
and pass this house along
to your kids?

782
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,339
The easiest way to go

783
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,474
would be to demolish
the house,

784
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,113
which it sounds like
you're not going to do.

785
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:11,447
So, my other suggestion

786
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,485
would be to find
a hoodoo practitioner,

787
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,638
who would want to attain
her power,

788
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:20,756
and they're gonna take her
with them.

789
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:24,227
If we get this other one to
come in here and kick her ass,

790
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,529
is all these other spirits
that's underneath her,

791
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,398
will they be let go
and everything?

792
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,565
Yes.

793
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,136
So, are you guys gonna follow
Amy's advice

794
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,604
and find
a hoodoo practitioner?

795
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,085
TYSHA:
At the end of the reveal,

796
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,857
I felt vindicated
because we have some answers,

797
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,257
but it scared the hell out of me

798
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,426
because I knew
what I was up against.

799
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,464
TROY: There's still stuff
happening daily,

800
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,564
so I took heed to Amy's advice

801
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,268
so we could start getting
to the bottom of what's been,

802
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,771
you know, coming around
and everything.

803
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:18,415
MAN: I am sent by the ancestors
to lead you to them.

804
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,250
TYSHA:
It took us a few months,

805
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,384
but we found
the hoodoo practitioner

806
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,855
who's been all over the world
practicing hoodoo.

807
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,090
This house is alive.

808
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,724
It breathes.

809
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,596
He was doing a lot of
communication with the spirits.

810
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:35,299
I summon the muertos
in this home.

811
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,835
Come before me
and heed my words.

812
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,274
He said they call
the main hoodoo lady "mother."

813
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,676
And show yourself to me,
mother.

814
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,379
Arise, mother.

815
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:55,152
He did several different kinds
of rituals to get rid of her...

816
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,654
MAN:
It's time to let go of the pain.

817
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:04,662
Unshackle yourselves from the
minds and deeds of your captors.

818
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:07,163
TYSHA:
...And the hundreds of spirits

819
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,365
that were falling under
her command.

820
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,072
I am sent by your fathers,
mothers, brothers, and sisters.

821
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,991
You could feel everything
changing --

822
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:19,876
the energy in the house
shifting.

823
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,146
Then leave this home, mother.

824
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:24,064
Remove this curse.

825
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,948
Enter the river.

826
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:29,052
Go into the world of ancestors.

827
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,621
Be gone!

828
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,724
TYSHA:
After doing these rituals,

829
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,262
the hoodoo doctor is supposed to
come back the next day

830
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:41,666
to finish the ceremony,
but he never came back.

831
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:45,035
He said that he was sick
in his hotel room,

832
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,668
and he could not leave,

833
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:51,642
but I have a feeling when
he felt the power of mother,

834
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:55,178
he realized that maybe he was
over his head.

835
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,714
So, now I'm back to square one,

836
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,282
finding
another hoodoo practitioner,

837
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,854
and my concerns have amplified
even more.

838
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,455
He didn't finish,

839
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,991
and I'm just afraid that
he stirred everything up.

840
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,259
I don't even know
what's gonna happen.

841
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,496
I am so frightened.

842
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,333
AMY:
This is a dire situation,

843
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,938
and one that's only going
to get worse with time,

844
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,337
but I won't let that happen.

845
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:24,306
I'm already in touch
with Tysha and Troy

846
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,775
to help them find
the right hoodoo practitioner,

847
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,548
and together, we're going to
put a stop to her for good.
