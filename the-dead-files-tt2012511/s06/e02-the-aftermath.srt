1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,928
I really, really hope they don't live here.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,231
I seen my son in the air
by the back of his shirt.

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,905
This poltergeist has some juice.

4
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:22,242
I understand it was a shootout, though.

5
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,679
They opened fire and
three deputies were killed.

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:27,451
This thing is, mm, not good.

7
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:30,323
I never been through this. I
never experienced this before.

8
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:33,320
He says, "I'm gonna get ya."

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,799
It's like somebody's
into some dark [bleep].

10
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,203
You're mine you can't escape.

11
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,562
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:45,185
What's happening?

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,179
I see dead people.

14
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,740
It seems like a devil.

15
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,734
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:52,439
He's pissed off.

17
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,673
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,675
I felt real fear.

19
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:58,849
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,620
I think she's being murdered.

21
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,223
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:03,759
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,095
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:07,598
Serial killer pops in my head.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,968
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,370
Nobody believes me.

27
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,906
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,877
- You think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

29
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,547
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,650
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,153
Until the very end.

32
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,825
You got problems. I got news for you.

33
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:24,795
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:26,731
This is our house, whether
they like it or not.

35
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,430
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:31,242
This is their house...
the house of the dead.

37
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,409
I'm in Florida City.

38
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,478
It's about 45 minutes south of Miami.

39
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,555
I got a call from a married couple,

40
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:57,893
Tracy and Travas.

41
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,529
The family's so scared by
what's happening in the house,

42
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,832
every night they grab their three kids,

43
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,702
and they huddle in the same room
together till the sun comes up.

44
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,473
It broke my heart listening to their story.

45
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,824
I'm really hoping Amy
and I can help them out.

46
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,213
Since Amy can see two worlds,

47
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:20,185
this one has to be free
of any leading information.

48
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:22,650
Family photos, trophies and personal items

49
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,586
can influence her findings

50
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:26,655
so it's important I
cover or remove them all

51
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:28,155
before she begins her walk.

52
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,072
Oh, boy.

53
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,935
Hmm.

54
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,149
Right away, there were, like,

55
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,954
several dead people on
the other side of the door

56
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:56,993
piling up on each other,
desperate to get out.

57
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,863
So, there's something going on here

58
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:02,701
that's preventing them from leaving.

59
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:07,639
It's like somebody's into
some dark [bleep], I think.

60
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,347
I do get something with witchcraft.

61
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:21,292
Now, Tracy, when we spoke on the phone,

62
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,827
you sounded pretty bad.

63
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,563
Tell me again exactly what's going on.

64
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:27,568
There's a lot of different apparitions,

65
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,468
a lot of touching, bruises...

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,238
attacks.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,740
How long have you guys been livin here?

68
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,942
It's been a year now. Why'd you move?

69
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:39,041
Just so my kids could have their own room.

70
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:44,049
But seems like I've moved
here to live in a one-bedroom,

71
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,485
because they're too afraid
to sleep in their own room.

72
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,986
Now, who exactly is living in the house?

73
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,496
My husband,

74
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,361
my daughter... she's 13...

75
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,731
my son Travis, he's eight years old.

76
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,224
And the baby, he's two.

77
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,839
Okay. You told me on the phone
you did a blessing on the house.

78
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,851
Yes, I have.

79
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:08,785
When I first came, the
landlord actually told me

80
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,743
that she's been saging the house.

81
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,511
Why would the landlord tell you that?

82
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,179
At the time when I moved in,

83
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:16,416
I didn't think about
it when she told me that

84
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,214
because I was just so
excited to be in a home.

85
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,515
So, I continue saging the house.

86
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,416
It seems like everything
just got worse after then.

87
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
It's not right what's going on here.

88
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,963
There's [bleep] going on all over here.

89
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,664
This is insane.

90
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,802
I'm seeing this woman and
this man who lived here.

91
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,837
They're inviting dead
people to come home with them

92
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,898
and trapping them.

93
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:53,712
Either someone in this house now
or someone who used to live here

94
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,880
is messing around with dark magic

95
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:59,583
and is calling out to the
dead, but I don't know why.

96
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,216
I really [bleep] hope

97
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,318
these people are not here anymore.

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,288
I'm angry right now.

99
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,293
I really, really [bleep]
hope they don't live here.

100
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,097
What else is going on?

101
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,563
Mood swings.

102
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,363
What kind of mood swings?
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:21,930
I could be one moment cooking
and being happy and laughing,

104
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:25,499
and then all of sudden, I
just get into being angry.

105
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,300
I'm just so mad,

106
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:31,265
and I get very abusive to my husband.

107
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,635
I really have to, like, leave the house.

108
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:36,171
When you leave the house,
are your moods better?

109
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:37,671
Perfect. I'm happy.

110
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:40,005
You on any medication
that would cause this?

111
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,453
No.

112
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,412
It got real bad where my relationship

113
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:49,562
with my husband is really going down.

114
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,684
We were like love birds.

115
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,954
We were together for 13 years,

116
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:57,154
and it's like now, there's
times that I don't want

117
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,924
nothing to do with my husband at all.

118
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,159
Sorry.

119
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,765
It's gotta be tough for
him too, I would think.

120
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,364
It's real tough, and he doesn't walk away,

121
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:14,568
'cause he knows it's this house
that's making me act like this.

122
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,034
This is not me.

123
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:26,977
There's also really intense and big energy.

124
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,447
I'm thinking it's some type of poltergeist.

125
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:37,352
This person is not mentally well.

126
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:43,199
I think it's the person
practicing dark [bleep].

127
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:48,729
I would think that people who were here

128
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:53,165
would feel this panic.

129
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:59,168
It's really fear, but you feel it like...

130
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,733
anxiety.

131
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,309
I'm, like, literally shaking.

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,617
So, what's going on in here?

133
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,052
We all sleep together here.

134
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:19,789
My son, the babies, stays
in this room with us,

135
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,193
because they're too scared to
be in the rest of the house.

136
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:27,564
I actually had my son that
was lifted off the floor.

137
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,501
He was in the air.

138
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:34,103
I seen my son in the air
by the back of his shirt.

139
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,474
What happened?

140
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:39,779
My husband got off the
bed and he fell completely.

141
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:41,248
So, whatever had him let go?

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,752
Yes, and he was scared.

143
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,088
We were all scared.

144
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,665
And what about you? Anything with you?

145
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:53,362
Yeah. I wake up with bruises
on my legs like I've been hit.

146
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:54,962
Just on your legs?

147
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,797
Yes, just on my legs.

148
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,033
This is just something small.

149
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:03,638
This is when the bruises
are already just going away.

150
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,174
Yeah, but you said the
kids sleep in bed with you.

151
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,550
Sure you ain't getting kicked by the kids?

152
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,546
No, no, no, no. I'm a light sleeper.

153
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,692
What happened?

154
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,596
I just keep getting touched on.

155
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,366
So, you're getting touched right now?

156
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,835
Yes, while I'm talking to you.

157
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,004
Every time I keep telling you

158
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,173
about something that has happened in here,

159
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,988
somebody keeps tapping me on my back.

160
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,545
I'm getting mad.

161
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,513
I'm starting to get upset about this now.

162
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,218
Wow.

163
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,391
This poltergeist has some juice.

164
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,059
Person's praying. I see
the back of her head.

165
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,827
She's got her hair pinned
kind of like mine...

166
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,132
pinned up, brown.

167
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,467
She gets smacked by the poltergeist.

168
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,658
Smack.

169
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,006
What all can this poltergeist do?

170
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:05,840
Slapping, hitting, pushing,
shoving, holding people down.

171
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:08,642
I see her again, beat up by this energy.

172
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,643
Someone's feeding it, for sure.

173
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:14,348
Getting scared now.

174
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,584
Let's go outside.

175
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,321
Just had to get out of there. I'm sorry.

176
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,990
No, no, listen, I'm gonna try my hardest

177
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,492
to figure out what the hell's here.

178
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:25,362
That's one thing about me...
I'm real hard on the inside

179
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:31,667
and the outside, but
this, it makes you weak.

180
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,168
So, Travas, this is your son's room?

181
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,174
This is Travas and DeSean's room,

182
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,343
but they won't sleep in here.

183
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,045
They're too scared to sleep in here.

184
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,745
That's sad, actually.

185
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:13,479
Now, I was talking to your wife,

186
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,348
and, I tell you, the
stuff she was telling me

187
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,386
that's been going on
here is really concerning.

188
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:23,695
Everything was good, but
moved into this house,

189
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:27,330
and all of a sudden, like,
everything just went chaos.

190
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,130
She's, like, a totally different person,

191
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,668
like, anger... like, straight mad, angry.

192
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,616
And she wasn't like that before?

193
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,106
No, never like that.

194
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,874
Never.

195
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,541
We almost got a divorce.

196
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,711
Geez.

197
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,547
Now, what makes you
think this is paranormal?

198
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,915
It's got to be.

199
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,282
We had a perfect marriage for so long

200
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,385
till we moved here.

201
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,822
Tell me about some of the experiences.

202
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:52,490
If I am watching TV and
I'm sitting on the bed,

203
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:55,161
I've seen, like, a shadow
right there by my door.

204
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,531
As soon as I turn, you
see the shadow just leave.

205
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,965
- What kind of shadow? What's it look like?
- A dark shadow.

206
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,299
Okay, what, does it
stay there? Is it quick?

207
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:02,633
- What's the story?
- Nah, it's quick.

208
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,941
When you get ready to, like,
look that way, all of a sudden,

209
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,236
it goes down the hall.

210
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,012
Okay.

211
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,372
When I was talking to your wife,

212
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:10,739
she was talking about
all the physical things

213
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,477
that are happening to her
and how things have changed.

214
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,116
She wakes up with bruises and
everything. What about you?

215
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,719
I don't have bruises,

216
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:20,220
but, one day, I was dozing off in my bed,

217
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,056
and I woke up, but I'm,
like, stuck... can't move.

218
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,826
My eyes open, but I
can't say nothing or move.

219
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:28,062
Wow. So, what'd you do?

220
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,463
I couldn't do nothing.

221
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,999
There's nothing I could've
did until I popped out of it.

222
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:35,936
It let me go, and then I wake up...

223
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,274
neck pains, like, before I
go to work in the morning.

224
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:41,106
My back be hurting.

225
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:44,007
I never been through this. I
never experienced this before.

226
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,544
How are living like that?

227
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:48,311
It's hard, man. It's hard.

228
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:59,690
There's this weird, dark thing.

229
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,692
It's [bleep] weird looking.

230
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,936
It's about this big... like that.

231
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,471
And it's like shades of black and gray.

232
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:17,276
He moves around here a lot.

233
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:26,786
In this hallway, he's focused on this male.

234
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,986
What do you mean?

235
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,421
He drains his energy.

236
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:34,227
He possesses him, so
he jumps into his body.

237
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:36,498
This dark shadow creature

238
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,601
has destructive ways of
interacting with living people,

239
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:43,208
and I see that it's
targeting a man in this house.

240
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,142
It pretty much tortures him

241
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:49,816
and makes him feel
trapped inside of himself.

242
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:55,655
And when he does that,
he causes extreme pain.

243
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:57,888
Do you know what it wants from him?

244
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,758
Death.

245
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,825
Yeah, this thing is not good.

246
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,996
Sweetheart, how old are you?

247
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,798
- I'm 13.
- 13.

248
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,968
Okay, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

249
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,001
What have you experienced?

250
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:22,773
I see shadows.

251
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:26,078
It moves real quick,
and it's black and tall.

252
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
Where exactly do you see it?

253
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,549
Sometimes, I will be laying in my bed,

254
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:32,751
and I'll just see it go
right past the hallway.

255
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,819
- Can you see through it?
- No.

256
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:35,952
Okay.

257
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:37,485
There anything else?

258
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,585
Voices...

259
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,355
Just hear a lot of people talking at once.

260
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:43,291
Okay, does it sound like
they're talking to each other

261
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,124
or they're trying to talk to you?

262
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:47,758
I can't say because
they're all talking at once,

263
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,626
so I can't hear what they're saying.

264
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,763
Okay. How are you sleeping at night?

265
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,245
I got to force myself to go to sleep.

266
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,850
I put my headphones in and listen to music.

267
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,409
Okay, and you keep that on all night?

268
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:03,166
Mm-hmm.

269
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,357
Okay, are you afraid right now?

270
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:08,650
You seem a little, you
know, like, a little tense.

271
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:11,288
They don't want me here.

272
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,520
Okay.

273
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,334
There are people outside,

274
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,736
and I did see people down the block

275
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,059
that were, kind of, walking up...

276
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,309
Mostly men.

277
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:42,695
And they are out of it.

278
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,188
It looks like, you
know, a bunch of zombies.

279
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,891
How many?

280
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:53,062
A lot... about 20, 25.

281
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,922
I do hear them.

282
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,777
I think this person hears
them talking outside...

283
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,578
mumble, mumble, mumble.

284
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,978
This bothers this person a great deal.

285
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:20,953
This person is really good

286
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:26,659
at pushing things out and blocking things,

287
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:31,432
but there's still this overwhelming fear.

288
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,135
They need to just get the [bleep] out.

289
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:52,744
I know Hurricane Andrew
devastated southern Florida.

290
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,379
In fact, back in '92 when it happened,

291
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,483
I came down here to
help in a rescue effort.

292
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,352
I reached out to a local newspaper reporter

293
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:02,223
to see if Travas and Tracy's
property was affected.

294
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:04,527
He said I should come meet with him.

295
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:13,171
Well, Ken, thanks for
meeting me. I appreciate that.

296
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,841
So, I know my clients'
home was built in 2004,

297
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:19,111
but what was there back in
'92 before the hurricane hit?

298
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,645
It was a mobile home park.

299
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,779
Okay.

300
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,813
Here is an aerial photo

301
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,584
that shows just how bad the damage was.

302
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,355
It was like a war zone.

303
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,457
Wow.

304
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:33,627
I just drove past this water tank here,

305
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,797
so this is real close
to my clients' property.

306
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,969
So, what was it like when the storm hit?

307
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,536
It was extremely intense...

308
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,537
Gusts of more than 200 miles per hour.

309
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:47,444
It was one of Florida's worst disasters.

310
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:51,116
It mangled cars, planes, boats.

311
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,988
At the time, it was the costliest hurricane

312
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,626
to hit the United States... $26.5 billion.

313
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:03,462
It virtually changed the face of Florida.

314
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,996
How many people actually died in Florida?

315
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,934
Andrew killed a total
of 44 people in Florida.

316
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:10,605
- Okay.
- And that included 26 people

317
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:13,239
directly as a result of the storm.

318
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,941
How did they die?

319
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:18,078
People were hit by tree limbs.

320
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,214
They drove their cars into high water.

321
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:25,889
One man actually got crushed
in his home by the high winds.

322
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,329
It was like a squadron of heavy bombers

323
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,302
flew overhead and just unloaded.

324
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,569
Right.

325
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:46,854
I don't get what the [bleep]
these zombies are doing.

326
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,084
Some of them look like
they've been eaten...

327
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:54,322
Like, legs are missing, and they're a mess.

328
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:01,659
They drowned, I think.

329
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:06,431
I know that, you know, they
pretty much died together

330
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:11,002
and somehow, they know enough to seek help,

331
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:14,308
or they're drawn to the energy here.

332
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,542
Very bizarre.

333
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:20,984
I reached out to the current
owner of Tracy's property

334
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:24,284
and some of the former tenants,
but nobody would talk to me.

335
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,118
So, since I was striking
out with the living,

336
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,552
I started looking into the dead.

337
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:31,053
After making a few calls, I got
in touch with a local professor

338
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,888
who tells me one of the
original owners of the land

339
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,724
ended up getting destroyed by it.

340
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:46,101
So, Dr. George, if I'm
standing on my clients' property

341
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,004
back in 1910, what would've been there?

342
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,372
It was a wilderness...

343
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,773
Flooded heavily during the
rainy season in the summer,

344
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,844
mosquitoes galore at all times.

345
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:56,551
It was the most desolate place imaginable.

346
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,711
I mean, who owned the land originally?

347
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,902
Well, the land down there,

348
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,328
it was owned by the Tatum brothers...

349
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,522
Four brothers who were big-time developers

350
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,613
in the Miami area.

351
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:08,160
- Okay.
- Men of means, men of standing.

352
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:11,131
In fact, here's a
photograph of one of them.

353
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,399
This is Smiley Tatum.

354
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,365
Heavily educated, he was
educated in the subject area

355
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,733
of chemistry of all things.

356
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:20,105
Here's his wife Florie. You
can see she's high society.

357
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,208
Very well educated, too.

358
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,277
So, now the Tatums that
bought all this land,

359
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,411
did they live on it?

360
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:26,612
No, not at all.

361
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:29,051
They lived in the more
settled areas of Miami

362
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:31,055
in beautiful homes.

363
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,989
You get a sense of the wealth they had.

364
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,857
These are like small mansions.

365
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,628
So, what the hell were
they trying to develop?

366
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,896
Well, the Tatum brothers
wanted to sell land,

367
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,467
and they needed to get
people to buy that land,

368
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,735
and so they sent some of
their people on their payroll

369
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,069
up to Detroit, hoping to get...

370
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,042
Actually hoping to create
a colony of physicians

371
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:55,045
who would move from Detroit
to this desolate place.

372
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:57,379
And they sold them this land sight unseen,

373
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,082
because their salespeople

374
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,085
are just so wild in the
way they describe the place,

375
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,450
"This is the Garden of Eden."

376
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,751
Okay, so let me get this straight.

377
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,219
When they came down here,
they thought they were gonna be

378
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,554
moving into, like, a place
that had infrastructure already?

379
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,887
Yeah, infrastructure and, you know,

380
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,087
more as a planned community,

381
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:13,456
but that's not what
the Tatums had for them.

382
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,658
Okay, now, on the phone,

383
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,261
you mentioned the land
destroyed the Tatums.

384
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,394
What did you mean?

385
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,896
They prospered for the
next decade and a half.

386
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:21,600
Through the first half of the 1920s,

387
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:22,903
there's a huge land boom.

388
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:25,337
And then the boom collapses in '26,

389
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,008
and they lose almost everything.

390
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,044
Wow.

391
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:30,346
She lost it all too.

392
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,815
When they lost everything by
the second half of the 1920s,

393
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,717
Florie becomes just a regular person,

394
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,784
and they're hurting.

395
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,285
They're straining to get by.

396
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:46,098
There's an elderly woman,
this kind of creepy chick.

397
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,603
Like, what I'm seeing,
like, a lot of animals,

398
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:52,838
like snakes and there were fish.

399
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,110
Like, I'm seeing a lot of wilderness.

400
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:59,247
Even the land looked wild.

401
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,787
But it belongs to her
so I'm a little confused

402
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,521
as to where the [bleep]
this woman's house was.

403
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,022
I don't know if she had four houses,

404
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:15,060
or she's, like, putting
it on four houses here.

405
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:23,936
So, this is where the old
lady likes to chill about.

406
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:29,609
Extremely wealthy, powerful woman.

407
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:34,044
She is physical,

408
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:38,046
and she is attached to...

409
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:43,881
a female in the house.

410
00:21:57,843 --> 00:21:59,577
So far, I know my clients' property

411
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,715
was owned by greedy land developers

412
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:05,086
and then devastated by Hurricane Andrew,

413
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,087
but I need to see if there's anything else.

414
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,225
Searching through the archives,

415
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,661
I discover a deadly shootout
on Travas and Tracy's land

416
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,630
between cops and four bank robbers.

417
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,398
This property's really
turning out to be a magnet

418
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,333
for pain and suffering.

419
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:22,335
I've placed a call to a local police chief

420
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:25,237
who says what happened will
definitely help my case.

421
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,081
During my research,

422
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,783
I came across an article about a shootout

423
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:39,686
between the cops and some bank robbers

424
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:41,454
that actually started in your jurisdiction.

425
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:42,891
What can you tell me about it?

426
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,561
On September 15, 1916,

427
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,662
these crooks by the name of the Rice Gang

428
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,598
did a bank robbery here in Homestead,

429
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,202
and they jumped into a stolen car,

430
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,870
and they headed to the Everglades

431
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,404
near your clients' property.

432
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,738
What happens next?

433
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,209
A posse was formed by Sheriff Dan Hardie,

434
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,814
and the next night, they went
down looking for these guys.

435
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:01,983
Okay, so now what happens?

436
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,720
I understand there was a shootout, though.

437
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:05,585
Yes, they opened fire on three deputies,

438
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:07,686
and three deputies were killed.

439
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,654
Do we know anything about who they were?

440
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,946
One of the cops that was
killed was Allen Henderson.

441
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,092
He gets shot nine times in the back.

442
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,892
What about the other guy?

443
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:21,329
Well, the second guy
who was shot was brother.

444
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:22,965
- His brother?
- His brother, William Henderson.

445
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,500
He was shot once in the leg.

446
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,166
Both of them died at the scene.

447
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:28,268
Who was the third cop?

448
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,904
The third cop was Charles Williams.

449
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:31,939
He was shot five times, as well,

450
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,305
and he died the next day.

451
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:35,639
The shootout happens.

452
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,009
Do these guys at least get shot

453
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,745
at the scene, the perps, or do they flee?

454
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:41,213
- What happens?
- They flee into the Everglades.

455
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:43,146
They were there for
approximately two weeks.

456
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:45,749
Eventually, two of the
subjects were killed.

457
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,051
Okay, so how does that happen?

458
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,386
One of them was killed by
civilians stealing supplies.

459
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,852
Another one of the guys drowned.

460
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,287
So, what happens with the other two guys?

461
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,223
Well, Frank Rice and Hugh Alderman,

462
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,425
they were apprehended

463
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,129
and charged with first degree murder.

464
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:59,097
Matter of fact, I have a article here

465
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:00,664
from the local newspaper.

466
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:03,468
Did they go to trial?

467
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,540
Yes, they did, and when they went to trial,

468
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,512
they were convicted of
second degree murder.

469
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,180
As a matter of fact, one of the guys, Rice,

470
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,985
he was paroled after nine years.

471
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,354
The other guy, Alderman,

472
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:17,393
went insane while he was in prison

473
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:20,040
and eventually transferred
to Florida State Hospital

474
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:23,102
where he spent the next
53 years until he died.

475
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:33,375
Everybody sees him in this hall.

476
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:34,741
Sees who?

477
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:37,212
He's the dude who is

478
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:41,388
possessing the other guy... the living one.

479
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,196
I'm starting to catch quick glimpses

480
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:51,131
of what this dark shadow
man was like in life,

481
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:54,068
and I'm seeing that he was
a very disturbed person.

482
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,237
He was captured.

483
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:59,138
He was a prisoner.

484
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,539
He was...

485
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,906
murdered or executed.

486
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:08,811
The living one, I think he went somewhere,

487
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:12,980
and he brought this home.

488
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:23,191
I feel like this guy entrapped him somehow.

489
00:25:23,193 --> 00:25:28,457
And so this dead guy
felt, "I was finally free,

490
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:35,820
and you trapped me, so I'm gonna get ya."

491
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,868
During my walk, I saw
a group of dead people

492
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,771
gathered outside of a
young woman's bedroom.

493
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,556
I'm meeting with the sketch artist

494
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,903
to describe this horrifying scene.

495
00:25:56,074 --> 00:25:57,676
On the other side of the window,

496
00:25:57,678 --> 00:26:01,343
there were several dead men.

497
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,341
Their clothes were all in tatters,

498
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:07,552
and I saw a person on the bed.

499
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:10,387
They had their hands on
their head, on their ears.

500
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:19,430
Is this what you saw?

501
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:21,267
Yes.

502
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:46,343
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

503
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:48,607
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

504
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,065
and our clients for the first time.

505
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:54,549
Amy, I'd like you to meet Travas and Tracy.

506
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:55,716
Now, they're a married couple.

507
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:57,460
They have three beautiful kids.

508
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,723
They have been living
here for about a year.

509
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,124
This is a photo.

510
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,158
Basically, since they
moved here, their lives

511
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,994
have been turned upside down.

512
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:08,764
The kids are nothing but sad and scared.

513
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:10,334
They want their happy life together.

514
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:11,667
They had a great marriage.

515
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,336
Now, they're talking about
possibly getting divorced

516
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,438
because of all that's going on here.

517
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,643
They wanna know what's here,
how to kick it the hell out,

518
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:21,077
and get back to their normal lives.

519
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,108
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

520
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,941
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

521
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,148
As soon as I walked up to the door,

522
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,250
there were a bunch of dead people

523
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:34,918
on the inside of the house

524
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,120
that were piling up on the door,

525
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:39,522
wanting out.

526
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,662
And when I came in,

527
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:45,543
I saw a female

528
00:27:45,704 --> 00:27:49,475
who was a part of a couple that lived here

529
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:52,576
who was messing around with magic,

530
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,010
calling out to the dead,

531
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:57,816
trapping and collecting these dead people,

532
00:27:57,818 --> 00:28:03,156
and what they left here
was this ridiculous energy.

533
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:05,025
And honestly, I didn't
know if it was you guys

534
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,861
or someone who lived here prior.

535
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:13,323
But seeing you, it seemed
to be an older female.

536
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,682
Well, when they got the
place, the woman that owns it

537
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,345
was saging the place when they got here.

538
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:19,582
Yes.

539
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,685
Wow.

540
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:25,786
Now, if she was saging,
then something was going on.

541
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:33,574
The other thing that I saw

542
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:36,543
pretty much as soon as I walked in

543
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:39,313
was a poltergeist.

544
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:45,187
A poltergeist is created by a living agent

545
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:48,121
by the electrical charges that
they send out into the air.

546
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:50,325
It's just a mass of energy.

547
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,361
Now, I don't know if it was

548
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,798
the previous family who created it,

549
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,835
but anyone who's having
emotional issues can feed it.

550
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:05,941
In the master bedroom,
I saw someone praying,

551
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:10,012
and this thing smacked her upside the head.

552
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,788
It's a pretty powerful thing.

553
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,492
Well, one of the other
main reasons we're here

554
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:22,195
is because Tracy's being attacked at night.

555
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:23,765
Tell Amy about that.

556
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:26,635
Well, when I wake up in the morning

557
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:28,203
and I look down,

558
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:31,541
my legs are just covered with bruises,

559
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:35,674
like if somebody kicked me, beat me.

560
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:37,975
Matter of fact, here's a photo.

561
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,377
That's the bruises she would get.

562
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,880
Oh, my gosh.

563
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,748
Now, you also got held down in the bed.

564
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,982
Yeah.

565
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,684
I was dozing off, and all of a sudden,

566
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:53,561
I just felt something
just, like, hold me down.

567
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,722
I couldn't say anything. I couldn't move.

568
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:59,727
I couldn't say anything, but eventually,

569
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,394
It let me go.

570
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:04,294
And it's not just you.

571
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:07,198
I mean, you saw your son getting picked up.

572
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,268
- Mm-hmm.
- Travas Jr. here.

573
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,108
It was the middle of the night,

574
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,512
and all of a sudden, I
heard him, like, gagging,

575
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,914
like something had him
by the back of his shirt.

576
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,718
We got up, and...

577
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,218
And he just fell, just...

578
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,517
Wow.

579
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,793
What else did you get?

580
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:34,696
So, there's this older lady that I met.

581
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:38,867
Whoever she can scare the
most is where she'll go,

582
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:46,417
and she is attaching herself
to a female in the house.

583
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:53,237
You know, making this
female feel out of control,

584
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:58,638
making her feel anxiety,
causing outbursts of rage.

585
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:06,221
Well, since they moved here,

586
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:08,822
Tracy's personality has done a 180.

587
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:14,494
I just get to a point
where I dislike my husband.

588
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,729
I just hate him.

589
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:19,068
I want to hurt him.

590
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:27,011
There's just times that I just
don't even wanna be with him.

591
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:36,189
They bad, bad mood swings.

592
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:40,466
And I know this is not me.

593
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,571
She wasn't never like this, never.

594
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,706
Till we got here.

595
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,809
Now, the woman you're talking about,

596
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,743
did you get anything else on her?

597
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:58,714
Well, one of the reasons
why this woman's here is

598
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:03,122
because she believes this land is all hers.

599
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:07,352
She was, like, very well
educated, very wealthy,

600
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:11,253
and she owned a lot of land,

601
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:15,489
but what I saw was just all, like, wild.

602
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:19,258
But it was weird because I saw her,

603
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,257
like, in four houses,

604
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:26,427
so I'm a little confused as to
where this woman's house was.

605
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:27,995
There's only one woman
that fits that description

606
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:31,031
that actually owned big
chunk of the land here.

607
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,869
Her name was Florie Tatum.

608
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,239
Her and her husband Smiley,

609
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:37,273
who were very wealthy, very powerful...

610
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,108
You mentioned they owned
a lot of houses, right?

611
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,444
She actually owned four homes in Miami.

612
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:43,214
Wow.

613
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:44,383
So, they lived large.

614
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:53,525
Now, they bought up about
26,000 acres in this area,

615
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:56,093
and this was nothing
but wilderness back then,

616
00:32:56,095 --> 00:33:00,562
but their plan was to make a
big profit developing the land.

617
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,465
So, they set out to get people from north

618
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,870
to get out of cold weather in Michigan,

619
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:07,871
that, "You're gonna come live
in paradise, beautiful paradise."

620
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:10,872
When they got here, it was a swamp.

621
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:12,842
What goes around comes around.

622
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:17,046
In 1926, the real estate
market here crashed.

623
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:18,981
Florie wound up losing everything...

624
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:22,386
her money, her standing,
her whole way of living.

625
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:26,426
Now, do you think that might
have been the woman you saw?

626
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,997
Yes.

627
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,704
So, this is the woman
that's attached to her?

628
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:34,007
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,643
I'm so mad at her.

630
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:43,987
Did you see anything else?

631
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,591
I saw this thing in the hallway,

632
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:49,695
and it was like this black blob.

633
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:51,229
This entity, I think,

634
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:55,433
had initially attached
to a male in the home.

635
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:58,734
I do think that people can see him.

636
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,705
I got that he was alive at one point.

637
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,841
He was either murdered or executed.

638
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:06,311
He was captured. He was a prisoner.

639
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,113
And I saw something about a firing squad.

640
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:10,254
That was all that I got about him.

641
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,116
Now, this is not so obvious for me,

642
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:15,587
but I got one thing I
came up in my research,

643
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:18,456
and it was a shootout between
cops and some bank robbers.

644
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,694
It happened in September of 1916.

645
00:34:20,696 --> 00:34:21,829
The gang called the Rice Gang,

646
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,497
it was two brothers and two other guys.

647
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,898
What they did is rob a bank in Homestead,

648
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,204
which is less than a
mile from your property.

649
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:30,072
Then when they fled there in a stolen car,

650
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,706
they wind up holding up by that water tank

651
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:34,077
that's literally a quarter of a mile

652
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,780
from your property here.

653
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,582
Well, you said a firing squad.

654
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:40,283
The only thing I can think of
is that the cops got ambushed.

655
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:41,786
When they showed up,
these guys all came out

656
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,623
and started shooting at the cops

657
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,495
and three cops got killed.

658
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,165
Two of the cops were brothers.

659
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:54,041
Do you think it's anybody that
was involved in the shootout?

660
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:55,678
No.

661
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,712
And why not?

662
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:59,848
Because it goes much further back.

663
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,284
Okay, so this happened in 1916.

664
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,144
You're talking how much further back?

665
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,865
Like the 1700s.

666
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,725
Oh, okay.

667
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:10,036
I think the living couple
that was into dark magic

668
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:11,195
brought him here.

669
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:12,700
He was in a cemetery,

670
00:35:12,702 --> 00:35:16,203
and these people trapped
him, brought him here,

671
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:19,725
and he's pissed because
he was finally free.

672
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,653
And he's lashing out
'cause he feels trapped.

673
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:26,681
I think the living person would
experience great deal of pain,

674
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:27,973
especially in the neck.

675
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,031
My neck hurting right now.

676
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:34,025
My neck stay hurting.

677
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:39,962
He learned how to
possess the person's body,

678
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:42,044
so he knows how to jump people.

679
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:45,033
And what does he want
to do with the living?

680
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:46,733
What does he want to do to them?

681
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,236
He wanted to kill him.

682
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,204
Sounds like you guys called
us just when you needed to.

683
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,896
I think so, too.

684
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,763
Yeah.

685
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,088
There's another thing going on here.

686
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:07,651
Outside was this group of dead people

687
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:09,944
wandering down the streets.

688
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,874
There was about 20, 25 of them out there.

689
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:15,433
To me, they looked like zombies.

690
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,458
Some of them, like,
their legs were missing.

691
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:20,522
Some of them looked half eaten.

692
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,647
All of them died together,

693
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:25,406
and I thought that they looked drowned.

694
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:29,712
Do you have any idea
where you're actually at,

695
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:31,236
like the area?

696
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,094
- No.
- Okay.

697
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,318
It was August 24, 1992.

698
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:39,848
Hurricane Andrew devastated
Homestead and Florida City,

699
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:41,472
which is where we are now.

700
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,295
Take a look at what their neighborhood

701
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,220
looked like after the storm hit.

702
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,475
Wait, this is here?

703
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,765
Yes.

704
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,856
Wow.

705
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:58,653
175-mile-per-hour winds
plus 200 mile per hour gusts.

706
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:00,045
Now, you said about 25 people.

707
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,235
Mm-hmm.

708
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,195
In Florida, 26 died the
day of the hurricane.

709
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,389
Another 18 died as a
result after the hurricane.

710
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,765
This was like ground zero for where it hit.

711
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:12,233
Wow.

712
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:15,136
I just can't believe
they're all still here.

713
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:18,106
That's very upsetting.

714
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:28,365
I did do a sketch of them

715
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,622
talking to someone in the
back bedroom over here.

716
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,115
And that's what she does.

717
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:13,685
I did do a sketch of them

718
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:17,556
talking to someone in the
back bedroom over here.

719
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,190
And that's what she does.

720
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,905
So, this supposed to be Rosario?

721
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:53,148
It's a female that I saw
with dark hair in her teens.

722
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,316
This sketch explains a lot to
me about what she was saying.

723
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:59,118
Broke my heart listening to her.

724
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,723
That's why she wears
her earphones at night.

725
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:04,892
They don't let her sleep,

726
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,929
so she'd rather sleep during the day.

727
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:11,334
You need to speak with her.

728
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:14,342
She's scared, this kid.
She's really scared.

729
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,267
I promise.

730
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,086
It's scary.

731
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,423
I was expecting y'all to tell me something,

732
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,970
but not at this extreme.

733
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,469
Well, Travas and Tracy,
now you know what's here

734
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,737
and what's ripping your family apart,

735
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,376
and the big question is can you stay here

736
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:40,312
and eventually be a loving family again?

737
00:39:40,314 --> 00:39:43,248
For the answer to that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy,

738
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,651
see if she can help you out.

739
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:52,325
You have a lot of random dead people

740
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:56,328
that were unfortunately
collected and trapped here.

741
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,667
You have an elderly woman
who's attached herself to you.

742
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:04,170
There's a dead male influencing
a lot of people in the house,

743
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:06,842
and you also have a poltergeist.

744
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:10,116
There's also the victims
from the hurricane.

745
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:14,052
The first thing would be a curandera

746
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:15,954
is going to be contacted.

747
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,989
What the hell's a curandera?

748
00:40:17,991 --> 00:40:21,994
They're healers traditionally
found in Latin American culture.

749
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:25,125
They will utilize various methods

750
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:32,095
like burning candles,
burning incense, using stones.

751
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:35,062
The first thing they're gonna
do is remove the attachments...

752
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,896
the dead lady and any of the dead

753
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:40,388
that would follow you anywhere.

754
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,476
The second thing is they're going to move

755
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:47,439
on all of the dead, including
the hurricane victims.

756
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:49,207
- Ah, that's great.
- So, that's awesome.

757
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:52,045
The third thing is they're
gonna clear the home

758
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,946
of all the residual and
current emotional muck.

759
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:58,849
So, it's a person that could
cover anything that's here.

760
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:00,686
Pretty much.

761
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,488
Okay, yeah.

762
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,189
Got chills.

763
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:05,692
I know this was a lot, though, tonight.

764
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,094
You guys got hit with a...

765
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:08,728
Wow, it's a lot, yeah.

766
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,130
How soon after they come through here

767
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,233
and do their thing will
they see the difference?

768
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,800
- Oh, immediately.
- Yeah?

769
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,533
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, that's what's up.

770
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:16,902
Yeah.

771
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:20,008
It feels like a lot has
come off of me, a lot,

772
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,678
'cause I really thought I was going crazy.

773
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,681
I thought I was going insane.

774
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,615
Yeah, we was on our urge
of, like, splitting up.

775
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:29,950
But it's just... at the end of the day,

776
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:31,618
she's still my wife, you know.

777
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,389
You're gonna take Amy's advice?

778
00:41:36,391 --> 00:41:37,824
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

779
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:39,360
How 'bout you? You
feeling good about what...

780
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,794
- Most definitely.
- Okay.

781
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:42,261
You know I am.

782
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:43,964
I was shaky earlier.

783
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,766
I'm still a little shaky,
but at least I know.

784
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:48,201
- You feel better, though.
- Yeah, exactly.

785
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:49,569
I feel way better.

786
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:52,071
That it's not the end.

787
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:55,339
Tracy and Travas need to follow my advice

788
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,906
if they wanna fix their relationship

789
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:59,638
and get rid of the evil that's
tearing their family apart.

790
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,240
I believe that once they find a curandero,

791
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:05,076
they can begin healing
and lead a peaceful life.
