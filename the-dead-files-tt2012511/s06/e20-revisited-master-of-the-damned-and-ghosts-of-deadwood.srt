1
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,806
Somebody killed themselves.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,343
NARRATOR: Tonight
on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,112
I've had customers
run out the door.

4
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:13,545
A second look

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,181
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,148
That's just really tragic.

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:18,449
New information...

8
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,419
Put everything in
a whole different light.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,654
...startling revelations.

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,690
DONNA: It couldn't be
anything but paranormal.

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,926
I had to come to grips
with that fact.

12
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,026
First...

13
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:31,295
He wants revenge.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,197
...in Potsdam, New York...

15
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,768
I need a solution
'cause it's got to stop.

16
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,234
...a ruthless spirit...

17
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:40,305
This is where
he took his last breath.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,606
...rules an army of dead.

19
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,544
He had control
over everything.

20
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,877
Then...

21
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,415
The more work we do,
the more the activity picks up.

22
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,018
...a return
to Deadwood, South Dakota...

23
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,587
They might have had
some sex slaves.

24
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,821
...where scars from the past...

25
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,658
Some of them beat the crap
out of the girls.

26
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,061
...could be lights out
for this casino.

27
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,129
I may never
get the place fixed.

28
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,964
Did they listen to Amy?

29
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,317
Are you gonna do
what she says?

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,670
Or does the nightmare continue?

31
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,673
DONNA: If you do not leave now,
you will be removed.

32
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:18,176
Leave now.

33
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,112
"You're mine.
You can't escape."

34
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,247
My name is Amy Allan.

35
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,283
[ Crying ]
What's happening?

36
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:27,102
I see dead people.

37
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,364
It seems like a devil.

38
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,591
I speak to dead people.

39
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:32,423
He's pissed off.

40
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,109
And they speak to me.

41
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,760
I felt real fear.

42
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,865
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

43
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,866
I think she's being murdered.

44
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,285
I rely on my partner.

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,669
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

46
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,604
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

47
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,671
Serial killer pops
in my head.

48
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,976
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

49
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,143
Nobody believes me.

50
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,611
It's my job to reveal them.

51
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,982
Do you think
there's still bodies there?
I do.

52
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,581
But Steve and I never speak...

53
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,619
We never communicate
during an investigation.

54
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:00,785
...until the very end.

55
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,586
You got problems.
I got news for you.

56
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,789
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

57
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,926
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

58
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,526
Or time to get out.

59
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,230
This is their house,
the house of the dead.

60
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,649
STEVE: This case seemed like one
I should've identified with.

61
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,549
We were in my home state
of New York,

62
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,587
and our client was
a retired homicide detective.

63
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,787
But I got to tell you,

64
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,890
there was nothing familiar
about what we discovered

65
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,558
in the town of Potsdam.

66
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,596
Donna had moved her family there
for the peaceful community,

67
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,898
but the unexplained activity
in the house

68
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,034
sounded more like a war zone.

69
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,669
DONNA:
We've been terrorized here

70
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,240
with the things
that have been happening here.

71
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,006
Our son has seen things,

72
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,043
I've been woken up
and seen things,

73
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,410
and my skeptical husband

74
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,747
has even seen things
and been touched.

75
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,981
And how old is your son?

76
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,615
He's 17.

77
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,686
Latest apparition he saw,
he ran into my room screaming,

78
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,824
and that's why
I wrote you guys a letter.

79
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,927
I need a solution
'cause it's got to stop.

80
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,192
Since I retired,

81
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,713
I came up here
for peace and quiet,

82
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,141
but it's been nothing
but a nightmare.

83
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:22,590
I feel trapped
living in this house.

84
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,004
That's why I called
Amy and Steven.

85
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,471
This was the last stop.

86
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,343
I'm pissed off,
and the fight's on.

87
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,628
AMY:
This was, without a doubt,

88
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,499
one of the most physically
and emotionally draining walks

89
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,067
I've ever done.

90
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,570
Immediately, I had to look past
the dead's disturbing disguises

91
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,905
and focus on the real threat.

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,672
I saw these men

93
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:06,279
who were walking like monkeys,
like gorillas.

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,316
It just looks like
their, you know, skin

95
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,117
has been painted on black.

96
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:17,757
One was saying that
they get used up.

97
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,692
He was a living person.

98
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,063
So,
what's going on up here?

99
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,397
This is the worst of it.

100
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,266
The other night,
I was sleeping,

101
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,800
and, all of a sudden,

102
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,104
right in my face
was this wolf-looking guy,

103
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,871
and he went "Raah!"
right in my face.

104
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,408
You're not on medication
or anything, right?
No.

105
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,509
DONNA:
As a retired detective,

106
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,945
the activity here
was so ridiculous

107
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:44,383
that looking at it in
an intellectual, factual way,

108
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,085
it couldn't be anything
but paranormal.

109
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,688
I had to come to grips
with that fact.

110
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,390
And then another time,

111
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,894
I woke up about 3:00
in the morning for no reason.

112
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,861
I see this huge, big guy

113
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,532
standing on the side of the bed,
looking at me.

114
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,467
He was about
at least over 6 feet tall.

115
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,971
He didn't look like
he was happy.

116
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,573
He was kind of menacing.

117
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,977
I saw an older man.

118
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:17,114
He's very condescending.

119
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,888
He has an elitist attitude
about everything.

120
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:25,056
He's very scary.

121
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:28,861
MATTHEW:
Is there any connection between
him and the painted people?

122
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,563
AMY: He put them to work
for him.

123
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:36,201
He painted them all black
and creepy-looking,

124
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,839
and he makes them
show themselves to people

125
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,373
and scare them.

126
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,711
When they're all used up,
they become like dust.

127
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,015
And what happens, then,
when they turn into dust?

128
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,384
They cease to be.

129
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,022
STEVE:
Donna's son was a big part
of why she moved out here,

130
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:01,393
but unfortunately, the activity
was hitting him the hardest.

131
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,594
And after he described
his experiences,

132
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,131
I understood why his mom
was so concerned.

133
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,232
I've experienced
some things here.

134
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,669
I was sleeping on this bed,
and I woke up,

135
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,374
and I saw a man dressed in an
army uniform standing over me.

136
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,508
And he was
just staring at you?
Yeah.

137
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,012
And then I thought it was
a human being standing there,

138
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,378
so I kicked him in the face.

139
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,248
My foot went through his face,
and he disappeared.

140
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,518
I don't like being here
alone.

141
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,986
Okay.

142
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,022
AMY:
This older man I saw --

143
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:36,060
He is pissed,
because when he died,

144
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:40,015
he kind of lost control
over everything.

145
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,428
This older man was already
really powerful,

146
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,806
and his intense desire
for control worried me.

147
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,006
Okay.

148
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,777
He says
that most of these people

149
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,977
were men when he met them.

150
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:58,515
He made them
what they are now.

151
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,654
But it was when I saw
he was motivated by revenge

152
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,455
that I realized how dangerous
he could be.

153
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,427
When he was alive,
I think he was haunted by them,

154
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,531
and he flipped
that whole **** around.

155
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,234
STEVE:
During these investigations,

156
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,138
I've come across
some pretty bizarre stuff,

157
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,157
and I still consider myself
a skeptic.

158
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,107
But if I witnessed
what Millard did,

159
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,161
I think I'd have
a different perspective.

160
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,181
I was laying on the sofa,
gonna take a nap,

161
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:33,118
and I felt a vivid touch
on my face,

162
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,821
and it felt like this...

163
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,490
Okay.
Like a finger?

164
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,490
Yes.

165
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,727
And I opened my eye,
and it was nothing.

166
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,929
And I remember feeling
some kind of a --

167
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,664
I don't know --
a presence.

168
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,634
I am a skeptic,
and I don't really buy into it,

169
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,604
but I knew this process
was important to Donna,

170
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,903
so I was supportive.

171
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:56,341
I'm glad Amy and Steve came here
to set things right.

172
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,745
Whatever was there that caused
that, I couldn't explain.

173
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,547
Okay.

174
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,517
AMY:
I feel a lot of pressure.

175
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:10,387
Somebody pushing.

176
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:16,295
I want to say this is the leader
and his little posse.

177
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,599
He doesn't like living people.

178
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,601
They violated him...

179
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,538
and he wants...

180
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,373
revenge.

181
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,474
NARRATOR: Next...

182
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,712
There was no signs.
There was nothing.

183
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,916
Sudden death spawns
an eternal evil.

184
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,514
He got really mad.

185
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,251
And in
our second investigation...

186
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:43,954
She was dying
of internal injuries.

187
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,592
...will this casino's luck
run out?

188
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,230
He's trying
to scare them to death.

189
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,844
STEVE:
Even though Donna's husband

190
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,411
was reluctant to put
a label on it,

191
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,748
everyone in that family
was having strange experiences

192
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,581
in that house.

193
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,750
So I reached out
to a former owner,

194
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,853
and she told me
her father passed away there.

195
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,123
I knew it would be hard for her
to talk about it,

196
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,993
but I had to follow it up.

197
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,801
STEVE: And what'd your father
do for a living?

198
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,534
He had been in the service.

199
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,671
I brought a picture
to show in his uniform.

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,141
So, what kind of a guy
was your dad?

201
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,575
He was a tough guy.

202
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,212
It was either his way
or the highway.

203
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,814
He was basically
a very strict dad.

204
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,282
What kind of a relationship
did you have with him?

205
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,050
I was always cautious.

206
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,686
He would get heated
pretty quickly.

207
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,190
Makes you be on eggshells.
I was, like, on eggshells a lot.

208
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,363
AMY:
I see that older man in here.

209
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:01,531
He doesn't like it
when people know about him.

210
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,853
It **** freaks him out.
It disturbs him. He hates it.

211
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,105
I had been following this
dead man for most of the walk,

212
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,210
and I started to get the sense
that he was just as domineering

213
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,710
while alive.

214
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,615
He had control
over everything, every aspect,

215
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,585
and then he died
and, like, "Oh ****

216
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,418
He's dead."

217
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,820
I think it was unexpected death.

218
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:28,026
He didn't have any control,
and he got really mad.

219
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,563
What the **** is that about?

220
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,682
STEVE: Betsy seemed
to be holding it together,

221
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,910
so I asked her to show me
where it happened.

222
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:38,103
And as she walked me through
her father's death,

223
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,537
I picked up some info

224
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,241
that ended up being
a crucial part of this case.

225
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,711
Does it bother you
being in here?

226
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:47,111
It's very strange
being in here.

227
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,447
This is where
he took his last breath.

228
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,348
It was very hard
to come in here

229
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,651
and know that
this is where it happened.

230
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,718
Right.

231
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:58,456
MATTHEW:
Do you know how he died?

232
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,725
Some kind of, like,
aneurysm, sudden heart a--

233
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,661
you know,
sudden death, whatever.

234
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,529
And what year did he die?

235
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,697
He died in 1992.

236
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,166
Now,
was there any indication

237
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,069
that he had a heart problem
or a heart condition?

238
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,271
There was no signs.
There was nothing.

239
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,976
You know, it was something
completely unexpected.

240
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,012
Do you know
when he was alive?

241
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,313
'80s, '90s.

242
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,617
Who was the first family member
to come home?

243
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:25,349
I was.

244
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,768
You were?
Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,151
What did you see?

246
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:33,492
Well, I found over in this area
a small round circle of blood

247
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,428
where he had hit his head.

248
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:41,200
AMY: Right then, I began to
experience the old man's death.

249
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,233
The agony was overpowering.

250
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,272
But it allowed me to view things
from his perspective.

251
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,714
I feel a pain --
back and my neck --

252
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,815
pretty **** bad.

253
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,055
I feel anger and stress.

254
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,092
[ Sighs ] ****

255
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,893
Did you clean it?

256
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,863
It's the first thing I did
after I pulled myself together.

257
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,397
It was important to me

258
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,400
'cause I didn't want my mom
to see that when she got home.

259
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,504
He died alone,
and that's just really tragic.

260
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,842
AMY: When I'm hearing
his thoughts,

261
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,145
I'm thinking, "I'm dying.

262
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,414
I'm dying. I'm dying."

263
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:31,850
NARRATOR: Coming up...

264
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,952
Oh, my God.

265
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,286
...what happened
after the investigation.

266
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:40,259
Go into the spirit world
and leave these people alone.

267
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,783
STEVE: Amy,
I'd like you to meet Donna.

268
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,317
Now, she's being terrorized

269
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,185
by the things
that are going on in this house.

270
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,624
DONNA: Meeting Amy
the first time was really scary.

271
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,059
I was so afraid that
she was gonna tell me

272
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,593
that I had to move.

273
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,661
STEVE:
This is her husband, Millard.

274
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,266
He's had a few experiences,
but he remains a skeptic.

275
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,935
With that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

276
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,534
and have her tell us
about her walk.

277
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:29,207
Well, the most powerful entity
that I met in the house

278
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,678
was this older dead man

279
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:36,114
who was very controlling.

280
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,681
The way that he died

281
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,285
was maybe an aneurysm
or a heart attack,

282
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
and this really upset him

283
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,259
because it was something
that was out of his control.

284
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,060
And this was probably
in the '80s or '90s.

285
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,226
[ Scoffs ]

286
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,197
He is upset
with living people

287
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,067
because he feels like
when he died,

288
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,337
he was very disrespected.

289
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,674
There's a guy
that died in this house in 1992.

290
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,875
The name of Cleave Lytle.

291
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,048
He died unexpected, died
of a heart attack in the garage.

292
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,347
Great.

293
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,050
Now, I talked to his daughter,
Betsy.

294
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,087
She described him as a "My way
or the highway" type of guy.

295
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,687
Not affectionate.

296
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:20,526
Now, I got photos of him.

297
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,948
He was actually in the army.

298
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,432
He was in the army.
Wow.

299
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,836
Your son said he saw somebody
in an army uniform

300
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,304
standing over his bed, right?

301
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,738
He sure did, plain as day.

302
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,675
DONNA: When Steve
pulled out that picture

303
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,977
of the previous owner
in an Army uniform,

304
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,281
I was so glad that my son was
not sitting there to see that

305
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,384
because that was
the same apparition

306
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,518
he saw in his room one night.

307
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,590
STEVE: And here's a couple
of pictures of him years later.

308
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:55,926
Wow.

309
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,030
I did do a sketch.

310
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,969
Wow.
Take a look at that.

311
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,443
Oh, my God.

312
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:16,582
Mm.
It could pass for him, yes.

313
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,654
That's definitely him.
The eyes are right on.

314
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,222
What's this guy's story?

315
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:30,495
He is kind of a leader
of about 25 other dead men.

316
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,229
Oh, boy.

317
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,367
And what he did to them was,
he painted their skin black,

318
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:40,070
and he makes them
kind of move like a gorilla.

319
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,341
The living people would probably
perceive them as shadow men...

320
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,608
Huh.

321
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,244
...but they're not.

322
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,743
Oh, my God.

323
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,611
Now, you've mentioned

324
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,915
you've seen shadow figures
in the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

325
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,801
You look out
of the corner of your eye,

326
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,652
and you see something
about 6 foot tall,

327
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,539
and I go to look, and it...
Away it goes.

328
00:15:57,574 --> 00:16:00,426
And I've seen that several times
recently.

329
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:04,229
I did a sketch
of what I saw.

330
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,564
Ooh.

331
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,098
What the ****?

332
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,636
I don't know if you're gonna
want to see this.

333
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,904
Oh, my God.

334
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,341
This is exactly
how I see that.

335
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,877
DONNA: When Steve brought out
that second sketch of me

336
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:24,283
standing there with those
painted people tormenting me,

337
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,683
that really creeped me
right out.

338
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:30,521
However, it validated exactly
what I've seen many times

339
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,940
in my house.

340
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,358
Oh, my God.

341
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,457
Wow.

342
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:37,027
That's crazy.

343
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,181
He can blind you
through migraines,

344
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:43,334
cause hallucinations,
fear and panic.

345
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,539
He can touch
by, like, shaking, pushing down,

346
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,306
feeling smothered --
things like that.

347
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,909
Now, you said he could
cause hallucinations, right?

348
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,276
Yes.

349
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,647
Tell Amy what you saw
in your bedroom.

350
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,380
When I first moved in,

351
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:01,885
I got woke up
by this horrible wolf thing.

352
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,388
Now, is that what he's capable
of doing, what she's describing?

353
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,625
I think so, yeah.
Absolutely.

354
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,926
What does he want?

355
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,795
He wants control
and to dominate.

356
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,702
He would probably prefer
no living people around here.

357
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,941
Well, you two said
you were up for a fight.

358
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,574
Looks like you got one
on your hands.

359
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,146
The big question is, is it safe
for you guys to stay here?

360
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:30,014
And is it safe for your son
to stay here?

361
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,516
The first thing

362
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,352
is to take this
quick-lighting charcoal.

363
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,606
And then
take the yellow sandalwood

364
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,826
and sprinkle it on
so it'll smoke.

365
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:41,725
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,494
And what will that do?

367
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:48,833
Basically, she's opening a door
for the ones who want to leave.

368
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,369
Do you think this guy is gonna
be the last guy standing?

369
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,570
Yes.

370
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,507
So, the next thing
that needs to be done is,

371
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,410
you need to find a medium
and a holy person.

372
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,510
Hmm.

373
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:03,148
First, you're gonna
have the medium come.

374
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,751
Have that medium remove
the remaining dead.

375
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,950
Okay.

376
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,022
Once the medium's done,
the next day,

377
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,088
you need to have
a holy person

378
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:15,094
come and bless the house
and then the ground.

379
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,397
You down with it?

380
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,332
Since the investigation,
things now have gotten physical.

381
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,628
As I went into the garage,
something grabbed my foot,

382
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,889
and I fell down the steps,
cracking my knee wide open.

383
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,530
When that happened, I got scared
that I may not win this battle.

384
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,066
I decided the fight's on,

385
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,234
and I followed
Amy's instructions

386
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,739
and I lit the charcoal
and the sandalwood

387
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,740
and smoked my home.

388
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,612
I'm allowing you to follow
this smoke out of my home.

389
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,717
If you do not do so,
you will be removed.

390
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,685
Once I smoked my home,

391
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,756
I told some of the entities
in this house to move on.

392
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,693
If you do not leave now,
you will be removed.

393
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:27,366
I am granting all the power.
Leave now.

394
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:33,404
WOMAN: A spirit that you've had
in this house is still here.

395
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,440
I was able to find a medium
who was able to talk to the dead

396
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,241
that were still left here.

397
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:42,314
I'm telling you that you have
passed away, that you are dead,

398
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,449
and that you do not belong
in this house.

399
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:48,451
With much talk and intervention,

400
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:52,123
I think she was able to get
the angry man to move on.

401
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,559
You need to leave here.
This is not your home.

402
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,397
You need to leave this place
and go into the spirit world

403
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,734
and leave
these people alone.

404
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,375
After the medium left, even
though the place felt better,

405
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,945
I wanted to follow Amy's advice
and get a holy person here

406
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,446
to bless the home.

407
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:21,653
May rose bless this house
with love.

408
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,625
Using the four elements
allows for us to bring balance

409
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,293
back into the house.

410
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,329
We started with the fire
and the candles.

411
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,363
As you light it,

412
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,667
imagine health and prosperity
being spread

413
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,902
throughout every corner
of this house.

414
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,442
From there, the goblet,
which is of the earth.

415
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:48,380
And then finally, we created
the water and the air.

416
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,848
This is the water
that we will bless

417
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,287
and then use for the house
and the ground.

418
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,257
You're going to pour
the water over.

419
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,793
And then, the holy person,

420
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:07,582
she actually blessed
the grounds outside the house.

421
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:11,336
With the rising of the sun,
spirit of the east,

422
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,205
be with us always.

423
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,107
Blessed be.

424
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:25,382
This house feels like
a whole new house.

425
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,517
It's a major difference.

426
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,420
After all the things
we've been through,

427
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,823
I can finally look forward
to spending the rest of my days

428
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,209
in retirement in this home.

429
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,526
My husband's a skeptic,

430
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,297
but I'm glad he supported me
throughout this whole ordeal

431
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,531
because things are a lot better
with our family

432
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,605
now that the negative entities
have been cleared out.

433

AMY: The angry man
who inhabited this home

434
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,376
was causing a lot of harm
to both the living and the dead.

435
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,447
So I'm relieved that Donna
followed my advice.

436
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,513
Not just for the safety
of her family,

437
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,619
but so that all of the dead held
captive there could be set free.

00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,869
STEVE: Our investigation
in Deadwood, South Dakota,

439
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,236
had everything you'd expect

440
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,737
from a town
straight out of the Old West.

441
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:26,311
But what we uncovered was
even grittier than I expected.

442
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,947
Our client, Ron, was
renovating an historic casino.

443
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:31,549
He claimed that paranormal
activity was getting worse

444
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,449
with every swing of the hammer.

445
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,418
And with the fate of his
entire business riding on this,

446
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,522
we had to get results.

447
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,896
STEVE:
This place is amazing.

448
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,063
RON: It's a great place.

449
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,766
Can you give me,
like, a broad idea

450
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,568
of all the stuff
that's happening here?

451
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,301
Well, we've had things
thrown around.

452
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:56,573
People hear noises,
doors are opening and closing.

453
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,411
You know, people are feeling
that they're being touched

454
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,179
and they get
really frightened.

455
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,512
That's a problem.

456
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,016
Oh, yeah. I've had customers
run out the door.

457
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,485
Do you know any history
about the building itself?

458
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,985
It was a brothel
in the past

459
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,222
and there was
illegal gambling here.

460
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,622
Why are you calling us now?

461
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,493
The more work we do,
the more the activity picks up.

462
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,727
Some of the investors
get spooked off.

463
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:21,232
I've been trying to get
financing and investors here

for the last 24 years.

465
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,469
The activity here
seems to put some people off,

466
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:31,842
and moving forward's become more
difficult, especially recently.

467
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,109
I love this place,

468
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:35,044

come to fruition.

to the location,

472
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,067
I knew it was going to be
a difficult walk.

473
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,367
I saw dead people everywhere,

474
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,902
and the first group
I encountered

475
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,004
were too frustrated
with their surroundings

476
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,607

the way it was
when they were alive,

480
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,844
because it confuses them,

481
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,298
and that makes them upset.

482
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,765
It does hurt my head.

It seemed like something
was trying to stop him

from getting work done, and
even though he owned the place,

RON: There's only

The activity has scared off some

that I experience how they died.

523
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:21,612
And I feel, like,
an impact in my head.

524
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,015
I feel like it's male.

525
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,418
Maybe they got shot in the head

526
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,253
or they shot themselves
in the head.

527
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,956
Well, I was laying down
over here, sleeping,

528
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:35,793
and I was laying
like this.

529
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,094
And all of a sudden,

530
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,313
I just went up like this
and, "What the..."

531
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,532
And I seen --
right where you're standing

532
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,132
is where I saw
this tall woman.

533
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,034
She was in a green dress
with red hair.

534
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,537
And I couldn't move,
and she just stood there

535
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,341
about four or five minutes,
and I just couldn't move.

536
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:52,610
Now, would you stay over
at night alone again?

537
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:53,910
No.

538
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,680
If we don't get
this paranormal problem fixed,

539
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,466
I might never get
any investors.

540
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,217
I might never get
the place fixed.

541
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:11,495
There's a male who is not
a happy camper at all.

542
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,467
This grumpy guy,
he stays up here a lot.

543
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:19,803
At first, I didn't think
this unhappy man

544
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,270
would be that dangerous,

545
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:24,974
but his temper flared
and I saw his true intentions.

546
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:30,948
I feel like up here is, like,
off-limits for living people.

547
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,984
And he gets pissed.

548
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:39,124
He's trying
to scare them to death.

549
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,161
STEVE:
With everything Ron witnessed,

550
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,595
it was no surprise

551
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,999
that he had trouble
keeping employees for very long.

552
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,565
But luckily,

553
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,668
there was one bartender
who had been there for years.

554
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,339
After learning about
her experiences on the property,

555
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,573
I'm surprised<i> she</i> stuck around
that long.

556
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,607
I was here for a week.

557
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,077
And I am the only person
on staff

558
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,478
who will come up
into the 2nd floor.

559
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:06,016
I've had my hair stroked,
I've had a hand on my forehead,

560
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,852
and I've had a hand
on my lower back.

561
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,054
Can you tell if it was
a man's hand or a woman's?

562
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:13,457
It seemed to be as if a man
was escorting a lady

563
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,791
out for the evening.

564
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,428
So, is there anything else
you've experienced up here?

565
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,230
I woke up
around 3:20 in the morning.

566
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,800
I heard footsteps outside.

567
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,467
I heard voices.

568
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,004
I opened my eyes,
and there was a woman

569
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,240
at the foot of my bed
wearing a blue dress.

570
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,908
I think her hair was red.

571
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,478
And she was
just looking at me.

572
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:40,850
AMY: There's a woman,
and she was always talking.

573
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,739
You can still hear her, you
know, going on and on and on.

574
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,593
People, if they don't see her,
that would **** shock me.

575
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:49,993
She worked here.

576
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,461
What did she do here?

577
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:55,132
[ Chuckles ] I think
she did sleep with people.

578
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,399
NARRATOR: Next...

579
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,535
So, this happened
in the Fairmont,

580
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,401
she jumped out --

581
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,688
She jumped
out of the Fairmont.

582
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,949
...the truth
comes crashing down.

583
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,176
I think that they died
down here.

584
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,523
STEVE: Ron told me
the Fairmont Hotel

585
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,657
used to be a brothel.

586
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,760
In an old mining town
like Deadwood,

587
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,159
that didn't surprise me.

588
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:26,264
But when a local author
described the violence

589
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,699
those women endured,
I was disgusted.

590
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,474
STEVE:
I got to ask you a question

591
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:40,978
about prostitution here --
Was it pretty prevalent?

592
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,480
Yes.

593
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:47,551
The ratio of men to women
was about 50 to 1,

594
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,553
Okay, so how were
these girls treated?

595
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,555
Well,
there some of them down there

596
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,759
that would beat the crap
out of the girls.

597
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,292
Really?

598
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,263
Okay, so the guys could act
however the hell they wanted?

599
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:02,033
Pretty much, as long
as they didn't kill the girl.

600
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:10,406
AMY:
That's kind of strange.

601
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,128
They might have had
some sex slaves.

602
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:17,815
I felt so much anguish
in this building,

603
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,016
but had no idea why until now.

604
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,655
I think that they died
down here, a lot of the ladies.

605
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,659
It was cold.

606
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,295
They would not eat.

607
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,464
The images were horrific,

608
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:38,770
and the abuse I saw is something
that will stay with me forever.

609
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:42,540
And they're all naked,
and they put them in here.

610
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:45,210
Do you know
who is putting them here?

611
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,146
Men?

612
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,714
STEVE:
When I first spoke to Jerry,

613
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,351
he told me two people died
in the Fairmont Hotel.

614
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,018
And the story he told me

615
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:58,355
sounded like it could've been
straight out of a movie.

616
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,556
It was in 1907,

617
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:03,894
and, Vinegar Rowan,
a sheep herder from Montana,

618
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,328
had a girlfriend

619
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,398
who worked as a prostitute
in the Fairmont.

620
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,330
Okay.

621
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:11,802
And he came in one day
to see her.

622
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,237
And when he entered the room,

623
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,072
found out
that she was with another man.

624
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:19,341
So, he pulls out his gun

625
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:21,812
and then he took a couple
of shots at his girlfriend,

626
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,612
and he missed entirely.

627
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:27,483
So, she leaps out of bed
and grabs him by the shirt.

628
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:32,256
He reaches around with his gun
and is trying to shoot her.

629
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,123
Boom, boom, boom.

630
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,360
And shoots himself
in the **** damn head.

631
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,162
He's dead.
[ Laughs ]

632
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,796
I've seen a lot of things
in my career,

633
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,368
but this is one of the funniest
stories I've ever heard.

634
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,936
So, what was the other death,
Jerry?

635
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:46,802
Maggie Broadwater.

636
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:50,608
She had been visiting
a boyfriend in Wyoming,

637
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:53,676
and they had
had a bad parting.

638
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,214
And she came back and started
drinking quite a bit.

639
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:05,621
I definitely feel like

640
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:08,192
there was somebody
who killed themselves here.

641
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,995
A female.

642
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,729
It wasn't long
before she decided

643
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:16,332
she was going to jump
out of the third-floor window.

644
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,834
And here's
a newspaper clipping.

645
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,871
So, this happened in
the Fairmont, she jumped out --

646
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,307
She jumped
out of the Fairmont.

647
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:30,380
And she did it
very dramatically.

648
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,648
She was hysterical.

649
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:35,417
It says here,
"Jumps three stories and lives."

650
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,522
The ground was so muddy
in the road where she jumped,

651
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,524
she actually stuck
in the mud.

652
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,326
And they extracted her
from the mud

653
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,093
and took her
to the hospital...
Okay.

654
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,664
...where she lingered on
for about 36 hours,

655
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,563
maybe a little longer.

656
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,399
They thought
she was gonna survive.

657
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,603
But it turned out that she was
dying of internal injuries.

658
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,339
Really?
All over some guy?

659
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:56,290
Yeah.

660
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:57,207
Okay.

661
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,644
Something bad happened.

662
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,313
She was so sad...

663
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,318
like she maybe lost someone.

664
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,772
It was really bad.

665
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:13,916
Very, very sad.

666
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,991
NARRATOR: Next...

667
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:18,262
Feels like
I was meant to be here.

668
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,295
...dark secrets are uncovered.

669
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,033
That's about as accurate
of a hit that I've seen her get.

670
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,169
Will this casino survive?

671
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,005
RON:
Good or evil, leave now.

672
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,274
Move on.

673
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,032
STEVE: Amy,
I'd like you to meet Ron.

674
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,398
Now, Ron owns this building.

675
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,869
And his dream is to turn
this historic place

676
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,437
into a thriving hotel.

677
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,940
Problem is, every time
he does some construction,

678
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,540
the activity here
goes wild.

679
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,111
RON: I feel
a personal attachment here.

680
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,144
Feels like
I was meant to be here.

681
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,781
And so, I was nervous
that Amy might find things

682
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:14,551
that would make me feel
more uncomfortable than I am.

683
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:17,321
STEVE: He's worried about
his guests and his employees.

684
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,956
Now, Kathleen here
is one of his employees.

685
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,357
So, with that,

686
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,295
I'm gonna ask Amy
to tell us about her walk.

687
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:31,601
I came inside and there were
several dead people

688
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:36,456
who were commenting negatively
about the decor.

689
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,277
Basically, all of the dead
have different ideas

690
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,080
about how this building
should look.

691
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,881
He can't get
any construction done

692
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,153
because every time they take
a hammer and swing it,

693
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,254
there's --
activity picks up here.

694
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,391
And the activity scares off
some of the contractors.

695
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,758
Oh, no.

696
00:34:55,793 --> 00:35:01,232
And the employees, and then we
have to stop and regroup again.

697
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,301
RON: I have to do
almost all the construction

698
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:06,135
and renovation work myself here.

699
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,907
It's a lot of work
and a lot of misery at times.

700
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,675
STEVE:
Okay, so what else?

701
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,397
When I finally made it down
to the basement

702
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:20,084
I saw several women
who were down there,

703
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,520
and they were nude.

704
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,225
And I did hear something
about sex slavery.

705
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,525
Makes sense, though.

706
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,493
This building was built
as a brothel.

707
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:34,397
The men that controlled
the prostitutes here

708
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,367
did whatever they wanted to
to keep them under control.

709
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,069
And when they didn't do
what they were told,

710
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,336
a lot of them,
from what I was told,

711
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,203
would get beat up.

712
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,006
Well, I did do a sketch
of that scene.

713
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,840
You did?
Yeah.

714
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,212
It's pretty extreme,
though.

715
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,021
RON: When Amy told me
what she saw in the basement

716
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,155
and presented me
with the drawing,

717
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,424
it opened my eyes
to a whole new aspect

718
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:05,361
of the prostitution industry
here in Deadwood.

719
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,262
They seem to have glorified it,

720
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:11,268
but in fact, it puts these women
in a whole different light.

721
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:16,223
I was walking by a bedroom
on the third floor

722
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:21,144
and I got that someone
had killed themselves,

723
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,511
that it was a female.

724
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:26,950
She had lost someone
very close to her.

725
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,486
And I got
that she killed herself

726
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,554
in a very dramatic fashion.

727
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,860
That's about as accurate
of a hit that I've seen her get.

728
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:40,131
There was a prostitute back
in 1907 named Maggie Broadwater.

729
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,531
She had a relationship
that went bad.

730
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:45,134
And she took it hard
and started drinking heavily,

731
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,502
before she killed herself.

732
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:50,975
Now, you saw a woman when you
lived on the third floor.

733
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,310
Yes, I did.

734
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,576
I saw a woman

735
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,779
and I woke
in the middle of the night

736
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,116
and she just stood there
for about four or five minutes.

737
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,521
RON:
I think that's the spirit that
was in my room looking at me.

738
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:08,525
And I think Maggie is just lost.
Just a lost soul.

739
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,260
STEVE:
What else did you see?

740
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:16,466
Then I met a character,
who I called the grumpy man.

741
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,937
He feels like
he would like the third floor

742
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,572
to be an area
just for the dead people

743
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:26,744
and that no living people
should be allowed up there.

744
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:30,048
He does want to physically harm
the living.

745
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,317
You've had investors
that have stayed overnight

746
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,485
and physically had their --

747
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,684
Arm moved.

748
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,122
Four or five other people
have been in that room

749
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:40,623
and they all had
the same experience.

750
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,724
RON: I've had the investors
in that same room

751
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:46,630
that have been touched in this
hotel, and I've lost them.

752
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,463
They never came back.

753
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:52,503
That would be something that
this person is capable of doing.

754
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,173
Well,
you guys have been hit

755
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,143
with a lot of information
tonight.

756
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:00,609
But the big question, though,

757
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,312
is are you gonna be able
to fulfill your dream

758
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,479
and turn this into the hotel
you wanted to,

759
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:07,251
and keep your staff,
your guests, and yourself safe?

760
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,386
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

761
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,020
to see
what she can tell us.

762
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:15,058
I believe that you<i> can</i> do
what you would like to do,

763
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,028
but it is going to take
a bit of work.

764
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,715
Because
there's so many layers,

765
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,332
this is going to take
about a year,

766
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,319
doing cleansings
one to two times per week.

767
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:29,272
What kind of a cleansing
are we talking about?

768
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,208
What you need
are basic things --

769
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:34,309
salt, sage, and holy water.

770
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,997
The first thing
that you're going to do

771
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:39,615
would be getting some sage,
lighting it.

772
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,854
What this does is it removes the
buildup of the residual energy.

773
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,957
And then, I want you to take
some salt and water,

774
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,710
mix it up, put it
into a spray bottle,

775
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,462
and then spray the floors
and the walls.

776
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:57,732
The holy water
is going to prevent

777
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:01,270
any more negative individuals
from coming in.

778
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,573
Once all of this has been done
and it's been about a year,

779
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:06,875
you will see a change.

780
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,346
The dead that occupy this
location -- they'll be gone.

781
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,983
Now, I'm gonna ask
the obvious question,

782
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,485
are you gonna do
what she says?

783
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,439
RON: Since Steve and Amy's
investigation,

784
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,274
the activity here has peaked.

785
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,344
The negativity here
has affected my business.

786
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,413
Business has been dropping off
for some reason.

787
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:46,666
I've recently just lost
Kathleen.

788
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,884
She just stopped coming in
to work.

789
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,788
So, now I have to do
everything that's required.

790
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,989
Run a restaurant, run a casino,

791
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,993
and try to do the repairs
and maintenance.

792
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,894
Got to get
this building cleansed

793
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,099
so that we can move forward
and get that business back

794
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,467
that we've been losing.

795
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:11,506
I went out
and I got some sage,

796
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:15,646
and I smudged all around
the hotel -- basements,

797
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,579
all the rooms,
all the hallways,

798
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:21,118
every place, every nook
and cranny that I could find.

799
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:25,356
Whoever's here,
you're no longer wanted.

800
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:29,226
Please move on
to a better place.

801
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:36,966
And then filled up some bottles
with salt and water,

802
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:41,338
and then we sprayed around the
entire premises of the building.

803
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,910
Maggie.
Maggie Broadwater.

804
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,745
Move on.

805
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,783
After the salt,

806
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,822
I got some holy water and
I spread the holy water around.

807
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,056
Coming up, Maggie.

808
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,293
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

809
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,561
and of the Holy Ghost,

810
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,199
I ask all the spirits
here within to leave.

811
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:12,987
I put more intensity
into cleaning the basement

812
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:16,749
because of the immense
negativity down there.

813
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:20,442
I want all the spirits herein
to leave now,

814
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:23,781
in the name of the Father,
the Son, Holy Spirit.

815
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:24,748
Amen.

816
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:31,488
The basement seemed to have
a whole different feel to it

817
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,322
than the rest of the building,

818
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,891
so I decided
to smudge the place again.

819
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:40,764
All the women who have
been trapped down here,

820
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,898
it's time to go.

821
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,636
Good or evil, leave now.

822
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,605
Move on.

823
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,813
Since I've been cleansing
the building,

824
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,879
I've been feeling relieved.

825
00:41:57,914 --> 00:42:00,784
That a big burden has
been lifted off my shoulder,

826
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,887
and we can move forward now.

827
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,655
It's been a long run.

828
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,094
I think it's time
for a new beginning.

829
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,465
AMY: The activity
in the Fairmont Hotel

830
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,102
definitely reflects
Deadwood's chaotic past.

831
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,705
But if Ron continues
to cleanse the building,

832
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,207
I'm confident the dead
will move on

833
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,479
and he'll be able to finish
the renovations in peace.
