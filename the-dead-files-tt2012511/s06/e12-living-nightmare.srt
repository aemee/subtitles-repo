1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,802
He has oftentimes tried
to destroy this house.

2
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:18,209
This is not her house.

3
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,216
He's a very violent person.

4
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:23,093
It's like it's taking,
you know, over her life.

5
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:25,533
- What did the voice says?
- "Leave."

6
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,168
Her family was haunted.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,636
This is not good.

8
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:32,678
There's a lot of chaotic energy,
and he'll flip out.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,447
She's not okay.

10
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,821
She's a disaster.

11
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:39,560
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:41,897
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,802
What's happening?

14
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:46,372
I see dead people.

15
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,410
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,082
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,718
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,153
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:54,791
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:58,266
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,268 --> 00:00:59,939
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,878
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,885
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:10,458
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,660
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,128
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,397
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,134
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,171
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,406
Until the very end.

33
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,142
You got problems, I got news for you.

34
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,348
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,420
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:27,689
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,762
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,921
I'm back in Flint, Michigan.

39
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,659
I got a call from a local sheriff

40
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,763
who's literally scared for his mom's life,

41
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,767
and he's not talking about street crime.

42
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,102
He says there's something in the house

43
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,305
that's really trying to hurt her,

44
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:58,541
and he has no idea how to fight it.

45
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:01,576
Hopefully, Amy and I can help him out.

46
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,492
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:14,029
I look for any leading information.

48
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,369
This house is filled with
photos and religious symbols.

49
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,742
Once they're covered or removed,

50
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:23,378
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,002
As soon as we pulled into the neighborhood,

52
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:47,542
I feel horribly ill, dizzy, nauseous,

53
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,509
panic, and this anxiety

54
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:52,545
because of whatever happened here.

55
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:58,951
It definitely is very present,

56
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:02,759
and my head is like [bleep] killing me,

57
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:08,630
like, all the back of my
head is just killing me.

58
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,768
Ugh.

59
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,009
Well, Ryan, I'm glad to be here,

60
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,111
especially knowing you're a fellow cop.

61
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:28,112
- You called because of your mom.
- Yes.

62
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,980
And she's going through
some tough times here.

63
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:32,482
Correct. My mom lives here alone.

64
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:35,285
She's had multiple things happen here,

65
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:38,556
and it just seems to
have gradually escalated,

66
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:42,956
and she told me that every
night something occurs,

67
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,856
whether it's a noise, seeing apparitions,

68
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,058
stuff getting thrown,

69
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,662
feeling like something's
standing at the end of her bed,

70
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,967
something getting in the bed with her.

71
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,003
I know my mom.

72
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,174
If she says something's going on,

73
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,979
I know something's legitimately going on.

74
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,614
Now, how long has she been here?

75
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,016
Seven years.

76
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,685
Did you ask her to move?

77
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,790
No, because I know she couldn't.

78
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,927
Financially,
times aren't the best for anybody.

79
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:11,062
So, let me ask you another question,

80
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,430
what do you think is going on in this house?

81
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:14,765
According to the neighbors,
somebody passed away in here.

82
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,000
- Okay.
- Previous owner.

83
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,168
And I think it's probably him.

84
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,235
I don't know much about it,

85
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,870
but I could've researched
what exactly happened here,

86
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,305
obviously being in law enforcement...

87
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,708
- Right...
- a lot more than I did.

88
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,144
And I guess that's because I
didn't really want to know.

89
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,145
Now, it's got to be tough for you

90
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,279
knowing your mom's here alone.

91
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,412
Yes.

92
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,346
I mean, she's not comfortable in her house.

93
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,749
You want to be comfortable
when you come home from work.

94
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,384
You want to feel safe. She doesn't.

95
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,119
If my mom's not comfortable in her house,

96
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:46,623
I don't feel comfortable
bringing my wife who's pregnant

97
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,323
and my baby in this house.

98
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:52,529
There is definitely something here.

99
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:58,567
Oh, there's something wrong
with the [bleep] tree.

100
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,601
What do you mean?

101
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,869
Very bad things have happened.

102
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:02,870
Several people have been injured.

103
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:06,843
I feel like a kid got hurt,

104
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,678
like, I'm actually seeing these
weird things in the trees.

105
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:16,285
They're walking around, breaking branches.

106
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:20,522
I don't know if they're dead
people or something else.

107
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:24,758
They definitely can shape shift.

108
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,694
What's gonna scare you is
what they're gonna show you.

109
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,262
Yeah. There's some creepy [bleep]

110
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,166
Now, Ryan,
why'd you bring me into this bedroom?

111
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:42,406
Well, this is where I stayed
for the couple of months

112
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,008
that I lived here with my mother,

113
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,012
and this is where the situation occurred

114
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,879
that started making me look into, you know,

115
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,083
exactly what was going on here.

116
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,318
Okay, what happened?

117
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,985
Well, I was sleeping,

118
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,454
and then the next thing I know,
woke up for 15 seconds.

119
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:02,126
I was pinned down in my bed,

120
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,626
and it was like I was paralyzed.

121
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:04,893
I couldn't do anything.

122
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,626
And I saw him holding me down.

123
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,529
He was right in my face laughing,

124
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,132
like, "I'm doing this to you,

125
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,034
and you can't do anything about it."

126
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,467
Okay, were you dreaming?

127
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:14,767
No.

128
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,201
I mean, I was clear-minded.
I knew where I was at.

129
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:19,102
Now, Ryan, after experiencing what you did,

130
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,004
and knowing what your mom's going through,

131
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,740
I mean, that's got to have you worried

132
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,876
that every night she comes
into the house alone.

133
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,178
This is not her house.

134
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:32,484
What the hell?

135
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,019
I'm seeing, like, this guy.

136
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,890
He's, like, a big guy...

137
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:45,330
built, tough... and he's naked,

138
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:51,940
and he has, like, a crust all over his body.

139
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:57,314
He told me that he was
a convict and a felon.

140
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:03,455
He definitely acts out a lot.

141
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:09,527
The man does not like anyone in here.

142
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,598
Anybody in here is gonna get it.

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,066
And I do see him, like, coming up

144
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,239
and, like, you know, just, like, bam!

145
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:20,408
Bam! Over and over and over and over.

146
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,610
He pretty much hated any...
everyone when he was alive,

147
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,212
and he hates everybody now.

148
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:28,347
I think he's even lifted the bed.

149
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,084
To the living,

150
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:38,088
it kind of looks like a big,
black shadow entity,

151
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,496
you know, like,
just looming and just [bleep] going nuts.

152
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,237
Now, Cyndi, you're Dawn's younger sister.

153
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,570
Yes.

154
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:56,670
Now, you know your sister better
than anybody, I would think.

155
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,171
Have you seen any change in her?

156
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,506
Yes. A lot.

157
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,143
- In what way?
- It's this home.

158
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,712
It's like it's taking,
you know, over her life,

159
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,513
like a man takes over a woman's life...

160
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,214
- Right. Right...
- controlling man.

161
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:11,350
And it doesn't want her to go anywhere.

162
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay, so, now,
the obvious question I'm gonna ask you is,

163
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,157
have you had any experiences
while you've been here?

164
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,225
Yes, I have.

165
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:18,328
Well, Dawn and I were down here,

166
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,866
and I was standing, like, with my back

167
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,468
towards the fire burner,

168
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,637
and I feel like a quick tug on my shirt.

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,174
Did you get caught up on anything?

170
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,710
Were you moving or were
you standing next to...?

171
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:31,911
No, I was in the middle of the room.

172
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:33,281
That's strange.

173
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:35,452
Anything else?

174
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,985
A couple months ago, I thought I saw a man

175
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,289
standing at the bottom of the stairs.

176
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,890
- Of these stairs?
- Yes.

177
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,390
Like, watching me come in.

178
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,957
Okay, what did it look like?

179
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,328
It was just a shadow of a man.

180
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,962
It was so dark, I couldn't see through it.

181
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,463
I don't like it being here right now.

182
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:51,463
Now, Dawn's here alone.

183
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,931
I'm curious what your opinion is

184
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,466
as to whatever's here wants from her?

185
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,866
Her.

186
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,967
Her. Meaning?

187
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,201
Soul.

188
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,369
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,539
All right.

190
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,176
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

191
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,980
That's your sister.

192
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,122
Seeing that convict, this is his area.

193
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,723
Oh, he's pretty physical,

194
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:28,794
like, he's pretty... a solid person.

195
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,598
I think they do feel him pulling people,

196
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,939
like, grabbing their arms,
like, "Get over here!"

197
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,440
or "I'm trying to talk to you!"

198
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,541
He's like, "I'm good. I can do this."

199
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,609
He has oftentimes tried
to destroy this house,

200
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:45,047
and then the walls won't be
able to hold him anymore.

201
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,481
How does he try to do that?

202
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:50,322
Well, he was showing me
with the oven and the gas...

203
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,990
Yeah, like,
I wouldn't want to be down here with that.

204
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:58,329
And he was [bleep] around with gas.

205
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:22,171
So, I talked to your son.
I talked to you sister.

206
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:23,606
They're worried about you.

207
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,310
Yeah. I'm not as outgoing
and as happy as I used to be.

208
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,747
I'm just getting so used to things going on

209
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,683
that it's just, like,
"Oh, it happened again,"

210
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:34,423
or I hear a noise, and it's like,
"Okay, it's in here."

211
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,059
So, do you think that whatever's
here is controlling you?

212
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,295
Probably.

213
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,531
Your son don't want to
bring his family here.

214
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,535
And I just feel like whatever's here

215
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,972
enjoys that, that way I'm by myself.

216
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,876
I feel watched.

217
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,678
I'm not alone.

218
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,247
I'm just with<i> it,</i> whatever's here.

219
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,782
Now, knowing you've had experiences

220
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,548
throughout the house,
is there any place you can show me?

221
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,983
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

222
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:04,289
I don't spend time down here
'cause it gives me the creeps.

223
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,424
What's going on?

224
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,558
Well, I've heard a voice.

225
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,158
So, what did the voice say?

226
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,228
It said, "Leave."

227
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,797
I left very quickly.

228
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,899
Could you tell if it was
a male or a female voice?

229
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,136
To me, it sounded like a man.

230
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:23,571
Was it threatening?

231
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:25,642
Yeah, to me, it felt threatening,

232
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,012
when somebody tells you
to leave your own home.

233
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,211
Anything else?

234
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,712
I was coming in from the garage,

235
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:33,718
I heard a squeaky noise, and I looked down,

236
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,555
and I see my basement door opening.

237
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,858
There was no wind, nothing,

238
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,497
and I saw it open halfway, it stopped.

239
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,202
And I just ran out in the front
yard and called my sister.

240
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,236
- Nobody was in the house, I assume?
- No.

241
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,505
Now, I notice that you're
visibly more nervous

242
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,108
talking inside the house here.

243
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,241
Oh, very nervous.

244
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:54,844
I normally don't talk about it in the house,

245
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,380
because I feel as if when I do,

246
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,020
there's gonna be more activity at night.

247
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:02,157
Okay, so you feel us talking
about this inside the house

248
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,525
is gonna make things worse here?

249
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:04,760
Oh, definitely tonight.

250
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,466
So, I'm seeing a big guy.

251
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:13,270
One thing that he likes to do,
you know, like, slamming doors.

252
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,547
He'll flip out and he'll, like, throw a fit,

253
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,016
and, like, you know, bashing himself,

254
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:24,617
like, full body, like, into the walls.

255
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:30,887
And that's something that
the living would experience?

256
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,156
Yeah. Yes.

257
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,696
There's a lot of chaotic energy.

258
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:38,766
He's very good at, like,

259
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,535
throwing his [bleep] on other people.

260
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:44,175
Like, in life he could hit them, you know,

261
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:47,474
in death he can be as physical as he can be

262
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,174
so, like, "Feel that. Take that. Feel that."

263
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:51,075
He's really, really good at that.

264
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,645
Okay.
This is a storage room, I guess, right?

265
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,047
This is my storage room.

266
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,382
I only come in here when I
need to get something out.

267
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:04,449
What the hell is this?

268
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,684
Well, one day I came in,

269
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,386
and I keep a bouquet of flowers in this box.

270
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,386
Okay. And when I came in,

271
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,856
one single flower from that bouquet

272
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,625
was in the middle of the floor.

273
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,596
So, could have somebody come
down here and moved the flower?

274
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,529
No. Nobody comes into the house.

275
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,995
So, what's with the frames?

276
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:26,267
It's Christian,
and I just felt safer putting them there.

277
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,468
When did this happen,
a week... like, a couple days ago?

278
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,469
No, it's been at least three years.

279
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,736
It's been like this for three years?

280
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:32,805
Yeah, at least three years.

281
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:34,076
And you've left it here on the floor?

282
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,544
I left it on the floor.

283
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:37,145
And if I ever come down
here to get something,

284
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,546
I just walk around it.

285
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,878
Okay.

286
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,345
And what do you think the
meaning of the flower was?

287
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:43,747
That whatever's here,

288
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,181
it's wanted me to accept the flower.

289
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,947
And I said right out loud,

290
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,414
"I am not accepting this flower.
I'm leaving it right here."

291
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:59,093
A woman is crying a lot down here.

292
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:01,763
I think she's not okay.

293
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:06,433
Mentally, she's not okay.

294
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:09,335
She's a disaster.

295
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,302
Very thin.

296
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:13,570
She's decaying,

297
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:15,973
and it hurts also in the back of the neck.

298
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,909
It hurts.

299
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,712
Ahh, and she said... Ow!

300
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:23,579
Man, it hurts really [bleep] bad.

301
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,414
Oh, my god.

302
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,418
I don't know how old she is, mid-20s maybe.

303
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,586
Very depressed all the time.

304
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:34,757
How would the living experience that?

305
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,893
They would feel her.

306
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,328
They would feel a lot of stress.

307
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,066
They would feel her get into bed with them,

308
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,834
sleeping there, talking to them,

309
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:52,473
touching, caressing, like petting almost,

310
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,408
like petting them, and snuggling,

311
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,910
like, trying to snuggle up.

312
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:58,114
She wants a mom and a dad.

313
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,922
This is a very active room.

314
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,357
Okay. What's going on?

315
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,025
I was sleeping on my back,

316
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:13,698
and something leaned
over and gave me a kiss,

317
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,301
like it was a goodnight kiss.

318
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,504
Not in a romantic way?

319
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:20,036
Not in a romantic way at all.

320
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,671
Anything else going on in here?

321
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,306
When I'm sleeping,

322
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:26,042
it will come and sit down on the bed,

323
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:28,310
and I wake up because I can feel something

324
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,179
going down on the bed... Okay.

325
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,348
As if someone's sitting down on the bed.

326
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,583
I just can't move.

327
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:36,223
I'm trying everything, and I can't move.

328
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:40,196
I've tried ignoring it

329
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:42,764
I guess I can't ignore it anymore.

330
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,965
I want my granddaughter to
be able to spend the night.

331
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,166
Doing these investigations

332
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:48,102
for as long as I've been doing them now,

333
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,838
everything you're describing to me,
this is not good.

334
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,807
I'm glad your son called when he did.

335
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,247
You know,
putting your head in the sand doesn't help.

336
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,148
Look, I've done it for what?

337
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,550
It's almost six years now.

338
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,888
Well, I hope you know that I
believe what you're telling me.

339
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,226
Thank you.

340
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:11,702
The depressed girl likes it in here a lot.

341
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,707
This is her bed... her bedroom.

342
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,374
She comes here.

343
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,379
She likes to sleep on that side.

344
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:25,924
She would like to just
stay up here all the time,

345
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,393
but she can't.

346
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:31,960
She goes from the basement to here.

347
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:33,628
She'll walk down the hallway,

348
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,737
and I think that people have
seen her walking in the hallway.

349
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:42,540
But when the living come,
she hangs on to them.

350
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,265
Yesterday Ryan told me

351
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,536
he thought somebody passed
away at his mom's home,

352
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,771
so I made a few calls,
and it turns out it's true.

353
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,772
I'm on my way back to Dawn's place

354
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,273
to meet the previous owner,

355
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,538
who tells me her husband died unexpectedly

356
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,772
right inside the house.

357
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,647
Let me ask you a question.

358
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,814
Are you a little sad being back here?

359
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,480
Just feel kind of funny.

360
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:28,183
Funny? I feel like crying.

361
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,818
How long did you guys live here for?

362
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,520
We lived here a couple of years.

363
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:35,223
Do you remember the
years that you were here?

364
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:38,764
I think maybe around 2003.

365
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,100
He passed away in 2005.

366
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,169
He died in the house?

367
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:44,909
He died in the master bathroom.

368
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,179
Was it sudden?

369
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,280
Yeah. Very sudden.

370
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:51,483
He was 52, I believe.

371
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,322
- Okay.
- I didn't find him right away.

372
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,721
I was bringing in some of the groceries,

373
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:58,155
and I thought it strange

374
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,357
that he wasn't out there helping me.

375
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,326
It was just a little unnerving

376
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,163
when I kept calling his name...

377
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:06,733
Okay.

378
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,501
And he never responded.

379
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,302
I'm sorry to bring this up.

380
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:12,473
It's okay. Okay? Yeah?

381
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,809
- You okay?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,211
You sure? All right.

383
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:16,312
I know this is tough,

384
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,345
and I really appreciate you helping me.

385
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,745
Thank you.

386
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,113
What did he do for a living?

387
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:25,119
He was a career soldier, 231/2 years.

388
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,455
This is a picture

389
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:29,958
when my husband came home from the Gulf War.

390
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,861
What kind of guy was he?

391
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:36,167
He was very fun-loving,
he liked to be the clown.

392
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,169
Go to family reunions.

393
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,307
This is one photo that we had taken,

394
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,313
I believe it was on one of
our anniversaries in Hawaii.

395
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,215
That's where we were stationed.

396
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:48,619
I miss him a lot still.

397
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:51,422
- I got to ask you an odd question.
- Okay.

398
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,057
When you did live here,

399
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,494
did you ever have anything happen here

400
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,231
that you experienced that you can't explain?

401
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,265
Mm-hmm. Yes.

402
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,398
- You did.
- Definitely.

403
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,266
I always felt somebody was staring at me.

404
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,537
After he died,

405
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,675
I could really feel like
maybe he was the one.

406
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:10,744
You think maybe he was here

407
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:11,979
right after he died in the house?

408
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:14,447
I think so. Just for a little while.

409
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:16,349
It was a good feeling with that.

410
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:21,889
I feel like there is another shadow entity,

411
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:24,893
like, crawling down the hallway.

412
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,531
It's, like, really fast.

413
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,768
In military they train you,

414
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,005
like that movement when they're crawling.

415
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:37,241
It's, like, nighttime,
somebody looking down the hall

416
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,180
is seeing this thing
coming at them like this.

417
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,621
He's confused about where he is.

418
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,558
That's why I say military,
'cause it's almost like

419
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,959
he's doing tactical assessing, you know?

420
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,260
Like he doesn't know he's in a house.

421
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,862
Do you know if he
interacts with the living?

422
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:02,000
I saw this kid seeing a shadow person

423
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,669
crawling down the hallway.

424
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:07,975
Was in a crib.

425
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:11,279
Probably two or three years old.

426
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,880
Now,
in just about every investigation,

427
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,380
I reach out to a local historian

428
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:22,015
to see if they know anything
about my client's property.

429
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,318
I just got a call from a local archivist

430
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,186
who says he hit pay dirt.

431
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,923
It seems the original owner
of Dawn's land suffered a lot.

432
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,758
I'm heading over to meet with him now

433
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,992
to see what he found out.

434
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,196
Now, you mentioned on the phone

435
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,364
that the original owners
of my client's property

436
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,628
had a rough go of it.

437
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,097
What do you know about them?

438
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,467
The Utley family came here
around 1848 from New York State.

439
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,135
More than likely, they're Methodist.

440
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:53,737
John came out here with his wife,
Lydia, and their four children.

441
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,172
Well, you mentioned they had
a tragic time on the land,

442
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,508
what'd you mean?

443
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,212
Well, they had 16 grandchildren
between the three sons.

444
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:02,750
And six of them died fairly
young, before age 15.

445
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:04,452
- That's a lot.
- That's quite a few.

446
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:06,154
We do know that they had a set of twins,

447
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:09,727
a boy and a girl,
and they died at age one day,

448
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,431
no cause of death listed.

449
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,800
Okay.

450
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:14,802
And then a grandson, Clarence,

451
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:19,410
who died at 15 years, 5 months from dropsy.

452
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,043
All right. What about the other three?

453
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,178
We have no idea.
They all died before death records.

454
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,783
Well, that's a lot of tragedy
for just one family.

455
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,918
Those weren't the only deaths.

456
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,521
The one daughter-in-law died at age 41.

457
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,389
Now, Michael,
you mentioned the original owners

458
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,490
were John and Lydia.

459
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,825
Now, what winded up happening to them?

460
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:37,128
Lydia died in 1861. She was in her 60s.

461
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,631
Then John dies, 1874. He's 86.

462
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,132
We're talking about a lot of tragedy here.

463
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,835
Talking about six grandchildren,
a daughter-in-law,

464
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,706
and John and Lydia all
dying on the property.

465
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,874
Yes, in a short period of time.

466
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,051
I see this little woman.

467
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:01,458
She's, like, very motherly...

468
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,362
and very nurturing.

469
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:11,071
She is thrilled that this is happening,

470
00:22:11,073 --> 00:22:14,442
which is strange, because she's religious.

471
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,278
I want to say that she's Christian.

472
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,281
She's excited that we're here.

473
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:22,417
I think she had several sons.

474
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:27,890
She says that the family...
her family was haunted.

475
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,060
She thought, "Oh, it's a family curse."

476
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,862
I thought that they were demons

477
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:37,066
and that the family was for some reason

478
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,568
being haunted or tormented by these things

479
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,967
through the generations.

480
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:44,303
She was just hoping and praying

481
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,405
that it wouldn't happen to her sons,

482
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,840
but now, you know, and now she feels bad,

483
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:54,378
because it did, and it is,
and it's not gonna stop.

484
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,438
I've already uncovered 10 people

485
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,109
who died on Dawn's property,

486
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,509
eight of them way too young,

487
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,780
but I still need to see
if there's anything else

488
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:18,447
that might help my investigation.

489
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,913
Searching through the archives,

490
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:23,250
I find one of Flint's most
notorious criminals...

491
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,121
Tommie Nesbitt.

492
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:28,392
Turns out he lived right next
door to my client's property.

493
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,596
I don't know if it's
gonna help my case or not,

494
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:34,766
but I got to know more about it.

495
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:36,938
I made some calls,
and reached a retired detective

496
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,440
who said he's gonna look into it for me.

497
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,881
So, Robert,
what were you able to find out

498
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,982
about this Tommie Nesbitt guy?

499
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:50,383
He apparently likes to be in jail.

500
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,383
Okay.

501
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:53,888
He became a thief at the age of 12.

502
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,756
He was caught stealing from orchards

503
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,094
adjacent to his neighborhood.

504
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:00,629
I got to assume we're not sitting here

505
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,799
because this kid just stole fruit.

506
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,000
No. But the crimes increased and escalated.

507
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,768
By the time he was 13,

508
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,171
he was sent away to juvenile hall.

509
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:14,072
His first prison time was
for breaking into trains

510
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:16,241
and stealing mittens and gloves.

511
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:18,442
Once he got out of prison,
did he straighten out?

512
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:21,610
No. He continued to commit crimes.

513
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:26,047
In 1904,
Tommie robbed a hobo on one of the trains,

514
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,184
and the train was moving,
and during the robbery,

515
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:30,819
the hobo fell off the train

516
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:33,986
and eventually died from his
injuries that he received.

517
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:36,354
And he winds up in the fight,
throwing him off the train?

518
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:37,356
Yep.

519
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:39,526
And Tommie was charged with robbery

520
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:45,400
and sent to Marquette
Prison for 5 to 25 years.

521
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,270
He told the justice

522
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,404
that he wanted to be a
world-class bank robber.

523
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:52,519
How much time does he wind up doing?

524
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:53,719
Seven years.

525
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:54,955
- Seven years.
- Yes.

526
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,157
All right, so do they parole him?

527
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,962
Well, his mother became sick at that time,

528
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,436
and when he was in prison he
learned he had tuberculosis,

529
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:03,408
or TB.

530
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,740
That was one of the
reasons they sent him home,

531
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:07,310
both his mother was sick and he was sick.

532
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,614
They spent a lot of time
talking about this kid,

533
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:12,349
like he was a real famous criminal here.

534
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:14,483
Well, he was famous.

535
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,354
Some of the articles referred to it as,

536
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,758
"Tommie's in jail again," or something,

537
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,992
but first name only.

538
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:21,863
So, what winds up happening to this guy?

539
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,064
Well, he came home.

540
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:26,170
And 30 days after that
or a month after that,

541
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:28,842
his mother died from her disease.

542
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:31,709
And in June of 1912, he died of TB.

543
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,411
So, this kid was just born bad, basically?

544
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:35,512
I would think so.

545
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:44,454
I'm seeing the big violent guy again.

546
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:48,323
This guy causes problems.

547
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:53,026
He said he's a convict and a felon,
and he has a gun.

548
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,661
He's spinning the gun.

549
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,198
And he's like, "Aw,
sometimes you got to play the game."

550
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,099
This big guy is the most advanced

551
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,068
and dangerous entity in the house.

552
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,105
I'm going back downstairs
to see if I can get

553
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:08,540
any more information about
what he was like in life.

554
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,977
He was a very violent person.

555
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,350
He was always carrying a gun,

556
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,717
you know,
he always had to take care of business.

557
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,702
I encountered a lot of
dead people during my walk,

558
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:34,676
but the dead woman
interacting with the living

559
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,248
concerns me the most.

560
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,054
There's two people in the bed,
and then there's a dead female

561
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:43,791
who is in the bed in between them,

562
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:49,229
but she's kind of cuddling
the person to the left.

563
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:52,528
She has long hair. She's pretty thin.

564
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,895
She has dark circles under her eyes,

565
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,393
you know, sunken cheeks.

566
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,526
Is this what you saw?

567
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:03,995
Yes. That's what I saw.

568
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,531
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

569
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,066
we're ready to reveal our findings

570
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:32,935
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

571
00:27:32,937 --> 00:27:35,070
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Dawn.

572
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,307
This is her home. She lives here alone.

573
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,911
Now,
the reason we're here is 'cause her son Ryan

574
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:41,779
and her sister Cyndi are
really worried about her.

575
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:43,280
She actually thinks that
something in this house

576
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:44,513
is trying to take her sister's soul.

577
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,151
Now, when I spoke to Dawn,
it seems like she was in denial,

578
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:49,985
but the more I was talking to her,

579
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,785
the more I think she's ready

580
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,388
to face what's going on in this house,

581
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,689
and meet it head-on and fight it.

582
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,389
With that, I'm gonna have Amy tell us

583
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,554
about what she saw on her walk.

584
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:06,790
When I walked in the house,
I saw an elderly woman.

585
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:10,126
She is extremely religious.

586
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:13,564
She's very motherly, very nurturing.

587
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,230
She said that she had several sons,

588
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,831
that she was very proud of them.

589
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,402
But she did have a regret,

590
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:22,737
and that was not telling her sons

591
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:26,072
that she felt their family
was being haunted by demons.

592
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:29,378
And she didn't tell them

593
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,579
because she was praying that
it wouldn't affect them.

594
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:34,446
- It would go away.
- Right.

595
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:38,083
And she feels guilty because it ended up

596
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:42,121
that they too were seeing
and having experiences.

597
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:46,257
Well, the only woman that
comes even close to that

598
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,460
is the original owner of your property.

599
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:49,562
A woman named Lydia Utley.

600
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,430
She had several sons,

601
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,697
and she was a religious woman...
she was Methodist.

602
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,965
But there was some tragedy in her family.

603
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,336
I came across a whole bunch of death records

604
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,205
for the entire family.

605
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,807
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

606
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,076
Now, the three sons that she did have

607
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:10,447
all lost two kids each on this property.

608
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,350
So she lost six grandchildren,

609
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,353
five of them under the age of three.

610
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:17,389
Now, one of the sons actually had a wife

611
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,058
who died at the age of 41.

612
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,961
His name was Asa.

613
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:22,527
They all died on the property,
the whole family did.

614
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,729
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:31,936
Next,
I encountered a male who was tall and thin,

616
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:36,809
and it seemed to me that he
seemed lost and confused.

617
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:40,146
Didn't really know he was, like, in a house.

618
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,616
And he was crawling down the hall,

619
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:46,288
and I think because of how he
was doing what he was doing,

620
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:50,559
he probably was military at some point.

621
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:55,163
And also, I do think that it's very possible

622
00:29:55,165 --> 00:30:00,103
that the living might see
him as a shadow person.

623
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,108
I was hoping this wasn't gonna happen,

624
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,146
but you guys knew that the
previous homeowner died here.

625
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:08,583
His name was Ron.

626
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:12,122
I was able to talk to his wife
and actually meet her in person.

627
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:15,260
Patsy and Ron wind up moving
into your house in 2003.

628
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:17,727
Now, Ron wind up dying of
a massive heart attack

629
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,733
suddenly on December 17, 2005.

630
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,103
Amy, you mentioned he may be a military guy,

631
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,640
well, Ron wind up serving
23 years in the Army.

632
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:28,209
This is him here.

633
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,715
When I talked to her,
she felt that she was still here

634
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:33,148
'cause she stayed here
two years after he passed.

635
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,318
What do you think about this guy?

636
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,958
I never encountered him
here as a conscious entity.

637
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,159
So, he might have moved on then.

638
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:46,995
Now, you guys have theories about this guy,

639
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:49,929
so at least now you have an
answer about what the deal was.

640
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:53,528
So, what else?

641
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,501
When I was in the basement,
there was a male.

642
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:00,103
- He is a fairly big guy, bald.
- Oh, my gosh.

643
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:04,973
And he's very solid for a dead person,

644
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,810
and I saw him, like,
banging up against the walls,

645
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,176
like, just like throwing a fit.

646
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:13,410
So, I feel he can be a physical threat.

647
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:16,311
He doesn't want to be here anymore,

648
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:19,284
but he is trapped here.

649
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:24,488
Sometimes he'll be interacting
with a living person here.

650
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,790
So, like,
grabbing their arm or pulling them.

651
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,926
So, he gets physical in the basement?

652
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,264
Yeah.

653
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,800
Well, you've been tugged, right?

654
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:35,068
- Yes.
- Tell Amy about that.

655
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,334
Dawn was showing me her basement,

656
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:40,703
and I felt somebody grab
the back of my sweater

657
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:42,806
and tug on it.

658
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,676
And I turned around and
there was nothing there.

659
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,742
And I was in the middle of the room.

660
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:50,913
Now, tell Amy about the door incident.

661
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,614
I came home in the middle of the day,

662
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:54,114
and I heard a noise, the creaking noise,

663
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:58,786
and I looked down and saw
the basement door opening.

664
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:02,554
Didn't you see a shadow at
the bottom of the stairs?

665
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,088
I was coming in the back door,

666
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,822
and out of the corner of my eye I saw a man

667
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,624
standing at the bottom of
the stairs looking up at me,

668
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,058
like, waiting for me.

669
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,959
What did he look like to you?

670
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,829
He was just all... he was tall, big,

671
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,369
and he just stood there
like he was something,

672
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,737
- that, "I am here. I'm the boss."
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:21,173
When I was upstairs,

674
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,844
and I went into the guest bedroom,

675
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:26,580
he was pissed.

676
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,116
That's his area,

677
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:30,452
and he does not like anybody in there.

678
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:32,254
Basically, he said

679
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,992
that anybody who comes
in there is gonna get it.

680
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,827
I do see him, like, coming up

681
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:41,994
and, like, you know, just, like, bam!

682
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,798
Bam! Over and over and over and over.

683
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,034
I think he's even lifted the bed.

684
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:49,401
Amy,
the one thing I didn't mention to you

685
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:52,103
is that Ryan here is actually a local cop.

686
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,707
Now, being that he's a cop,

687
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,076
I take his testimony a
little bit more seriously.

688
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,043
Why don't you tell Amy what happened

689
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,478
in the guest bedroom to you?

690
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,281
It was about a 10- to 15-second situation...

691
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,882
Okay.

692
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:04,083
Where my hands were pinned...

693
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,651
All right... up like this.

694
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:06,985
Okay.

695
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,524
He was looking at me, like,
"I can do this to you...

696
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:14,291
and I am doing this to you,
and I'm gonna do it to you."

697
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,028
- That sound like the guy?
- Yes.

698
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,629
Do you know anything about him,
like, when he was alive?

699
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:21,030
He told me that he was
a convict and a felon.

700
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,334
Extremely violent and angry person.

701
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:25,503
He kept showing me a gun

702
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:29,742
that he always had on him,
never left his side.

703
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:32,978
And he kind of indicated to me

704
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,349
that he had done bad things with it.

705
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:36,750
One guy comes to mind.

706
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:38,485
I don't know if it fits or not,
but it's the guy

707
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:40,223
that lived right next door on your property.

708
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,426
This guy named Tommie Nesbitt.

709
00:33:46,062 --> 00:33:48,567
Career criminal. He's all over the papers.

710
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,570
I mean, every cop in the town knew him.

711
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,339
He winds up doing burglaries on the trains

712
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:55,009
that went through here,
and then he robbed a hobo,

713
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:58,213
a bum, and in the fight on the train

714
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:01,283
he fell off the train,
and the guy wind up dying.

715
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,684
He went to jail for that,

716
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:03,884
but they didn't charge him with the murder,

717
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:05,018
they only charged him with the robbery.

718
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,919
Now, he wind up only doing seven years,

719
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,754
and they did pardon him,

720
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,955
but two of the reasons
were because he had TB,

721
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:12,254
and his mother was dying.

722
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:14,188
And when he was released,
he wind up coming back here,

723
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,391
living with his mom right next door.

724
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:18,493
Few months later he winds up dying of TB.

725
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:20,960
He died in 1912.

726
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:24,063
Kind of sounds like...

727
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:26,265
- Uh-huh...
- this guy.

728
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,267
You're not gonna sleep well tonight.

729
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,636
I haven't.
I don't sleep well most of the time.

730
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,104
- Anyways.
- I've been ignoring it,

731
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:35,506
just hoping it would go away on its own.

732
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:38,680
Yeah.
It's controlling her a little bit, I think.

733
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:42,048
He's my biggest concern.

734
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,386
He definitely does pose a real threat.

735
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:47,990
I mean, in a physical sense.

736
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:52,392
But he's fixated on getting out of here,

737
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:56,332
and he thinks that the only way to do that

738
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:59,600
at this point is that he
wants to destroy the house.

739
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:04,374
And what he was showing
me was gas line and fire.

740
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,575
He better hope I don't
pass away any time soon.

741
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,554
Anything else?

742
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:19,223
I went out into the backyard,

743
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,692
and as soon as I walked out there,

744
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:25,029
there were these really bad things

745
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:28,097
that would cause accidents and problems

746
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,829
and horrible things to happen to people.

747
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:32,729
And what I saw was, like,

748
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:38,338
all these, like,
kind of shapes in the trees and the brush.

749
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,307
They are shape-shifters,
so they will project themselves

750
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,477
in whatever manner will scare someone.

751
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,844
It's really bad.

752
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,581
They've caused a lot of accidents

753
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,120
to happen to people here.

754
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:55,122
Very bad things have
happened to people here.

755
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,323
Well,
could that explain some of the deaths...

756
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:58,993
the Utley's with their grandkids?

757
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:00,263
That's what I'm thinking.

758
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:03,500
Now, he won't bring his
18-month-old daughter here

759
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:04,734
or his wife who's pregnant now.

760
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,136
Yeah, no way.

761
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,538
Yeah.

762
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,445
These things,
they're capable of harming anyone.

763
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:21,821
And I know it's got to be
bothering you a little bit,

764
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:22,955
knowing what's here now.

765
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:24,622
Not a little bit, a lot.

766
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:29,725
I won't be
able to have Amore here.

767
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:39,304
So, I ended up going into the storage room.

768
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:43,205
Sitting there was this frail woman.

769
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,777
She... extremely depressed.

770
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:49,847
I think that you would feel
her stress and her sadness.

771
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,016
So, what she does is she tries to come

772
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:55,454
up to the master bedroom all the time.

773
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:58,588
She wants to snuggle in the bed.

774
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,259
She wants nurturing.

775
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,028
You know, I felt very much like
she was acting like a child.

776
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,562
Don't you feel people get on your bed?

777
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,362
Right.

778
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,199
But there's been times when I'm sleeping

779
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,969
and I feel someone sitting on my bed.

780
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,806
She's had a lot of experiences.

781
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:15,507
I mean, she's even had a kiss.

782
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:17,476
I just felt someone knelt down

783
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:18,643
and just gave me a kiss goodnight.

784
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,210
You never told me that.

785
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:23,111
Could that have been this girl trying to...

786
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:25,110
Yes.

787
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:32,090
I did do a sketch of the
girl laying in the bed.

788
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:14,958
I did do a sketch of the
girl laying in the bed.

789
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:42,208
She looks very sad.

790
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,976
This looks like a male.

791
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:47,245
What I saw was a male and a female.

792
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:48,513
Okay.

793
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:50,214
And her cuddling with the
mommy and daddy figure,

794
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:52,349
then she's doing with you, so...

795
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:55,589
How does that make you feel,
that you're not alone in bed?

796
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:56,890
Not good.

797
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:01,762
It's more than what I expected.

798
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:11,970
Well, Dawn, it's a good thing you have a son

799
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:14,238
that worries about you so much,

800
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,769
because if he didn't call us in when he did,

801
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,370
we don't know what would
have happened to you.

802
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,105
Question is, can you have a safe home

803
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,307
and make this the place you want to live in,

804
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,240
and live comfortably?

805
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,007
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

806
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:32,050
For the things in the back,
they're some type of elemental,

807
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:35,456
and basically an elemental is a being

808
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,160
that never was in human form.

809
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:41,263
They're not supposed to be bad,

810
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:46,205
but I've encountered quite a few,

811
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:53,073
and I have seen them not be
good towards living humans.

812
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,844
So, I think that a shaman
should be brought in,

813
00:39:55,846 --> 00:40:01,151
and having them do a ritual
to set up a permanent boundary

814
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:05,391
to keep those things at bay forever.

815
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:08,558
Then you could bring the kids over.

816
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,726
The second thing is to
have a psychic healer.

817
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:19,361
So, this person needs to come and go down

818
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:23,797
and talk to the girl in the storage room.

819
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,703
Okay,
so this'll get this poor kid out of here.

820
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,971
Yes.

821
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:32,541
So, now once that happens,
will Dawn start feeling any better?

822
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:33,710
Yeah.

823
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:35,012
You won't get no more sitting on the bed,

824
00:40:35,014 --> 00:40:37,016
no more feeling depressed or isolated.

825
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:44,022
And then,
the third thing is hiring a male medium,

826
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,692
who's a tough guy, to come in,

827
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:52,465
and he is going to engage crazy guy.

828
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:55,903
He's going to, basically,
have to set this man straight,

829
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:58,540
and move him on.

830
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,943
The elderly woman,

831
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:04,415
once everything has been dealt with

832
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:08,318
and she doesn't feel like
there's a threat anymore,

833
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,486
she'll leave.

834
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:12,555
So, you got three major steps,

835
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:14,922
but at the end of all of it,
you have your house back.

836
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:16,391
I mean, do you feel better, Dawn?

837
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,994
I just didn't expect all this.

838
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:22,495
I'm just overwhelmed.
It's not a good feeling.

839
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:26,232
I feel better.
I mean, based upon what she said.

840
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,902
I mean, if it's fixable.

841
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,372
Something breaks and you can fix it.

842
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,044
That's the goal here,

843
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:37,146
is for you to be happy in your own home,

844
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:38,480
and for your grandchildren to come here

845
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:40,415
and him feel okay about coming here.

846
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:43,551
That is the goal.

847
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:46,321
Sorry, Mom,
that I haven't brought her over more.

848
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:47,923
You weren't paranoid.

849
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,891
You had a good reason,
but we're gonna fix it.

850
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:53,590
Dawn finally seems to understand

851
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:56,156
just how active and dangerous her home is,

852
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:59,326
but I believe if she follows my advice,

853
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:01,563
she'll be able to live a peaceful life,

854
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,064
where her family will
feel safe visiting her.
