1
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:14,171
They're acting like they're still alive.

2
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:18,383
Whatever's going on here
really needs to stop.

3
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,426
It was a devil or a monster.

4
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:22,741
"I have seen a ghost."

5
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:23,979
There's no question in my mind

6
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,054
that there's something evil there.

7
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,166
The dead don't rest here.

8
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,490
His body was completely
mutilated and half-eaten.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,782
I don't know how they're
not killing each other.

10
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:38,329
"You're mine. You can't escape."

11
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:41,541
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,619
What's happening?

13
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:44,724
I see dead people.

14
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:47,171
It seems like a devil.

15
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,819
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,820
He's pissed off.

17
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:51,990
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:54,134
I felt real fear.

19
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,116
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:59,136
I think she's being murdered.

21
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:00,755
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:02,025
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:04,029
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,136
Serial killer pops in my head.

25
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:09,355
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,557
Nobody believes me.

27
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,023
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,292
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

29
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:16,028
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,069
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,275
Until the very end.

32
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,047
You got problems. I got news for you.

33
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,254
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,331
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

35
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,039
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,710
This is their house, the house of the dead.

37
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,118
I'm in Warsaw, Indiana.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,254
It's about 40 miles west of Fort Wayne.

39
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:51,832
I got a call from a guy
who runs a hotel in town.

40
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,735
Now, he says he was a lifelong skeptic

41
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,145
until he bought the place
about eight years ago.

42
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,569
He says activity's so bad,
he's losing employees and customers.

43
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,772
It's his dream business,

44
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:09,774
but he says if me and
Amy can't help him out,

45
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,981
he might have to shut the place down.

46
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,494
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:25,366
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

48
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:28,237
This hotel has a lot of
artwork and historic photos

49
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,339
that have to be covered or removed.

50
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,608
When I'm finished,

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,747
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,573
There's a lot of dead people here.

53
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,853
They're acting like they're still alive.

54
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:59,625
I'm talking, like, about 50 people here.

55
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,433
Do you know if these
dead come inside at all?

56
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,702
Yes, they do.

57
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:08,310
They,
um... they can come and go as they please.

58
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,554
The dead don't rest here.

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,132
Well, Dan, I'm glad I'm here.

60
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,468
Um, when we spoke on the phone,

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,768
you sounded like you're at the point

62
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,302
where you're almost ready
to close this place down

63
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,672
because of the activity.

64
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,674
We're having trouble

65
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,344
with employees being scared at night.

66
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,278
- Okay.
- I've had several quit.

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,414
Customers not staying.

68
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,483
So, give me an idea

69
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:37,818
of what people are experiencing here.

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,022
- What's going on?
- Knocking on the door.

71
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,959
Things moving off the shelves.

72
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,728
I've heard of people getting touched.

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,830
This seems to be worse
the last couple years.

74
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,666
Now, how long have you had this place?

75
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,236
Eight years.

76
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,538
This is a three-story building.

77
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,506
Now, I see the restaurant
here on the first floor.

78
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:54,675
What else you got going on?

79
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,811
On the second floor, we have a sports bar,

80
00:03:56,813 --> 00:04:00,851
and on the third floor,
we have seven hotel rooms.

81
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,753
Okay. So now, when you bought it,

82
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,421
did you know it was haunted?

83
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,790
I did not.

84
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,726
I dismissed a lot of it.

85
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:08,928
What changed your mind?

86
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,731
I was standing at the edge of the bar,

87
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,867
happened to look down at the floor,

88
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:18,675
and I seen a black fog go across the floor

89
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:21,211
and then just come up and then schoo,
just gone.

90
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:22,746
What do you think's going on?

91
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:25,785
Not sure 100%, but the last two years,

92
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,053
there's a lot of... lot of bad things.

93
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,889
Sounds like you could lose the business.

94
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,124
Maybe.

95
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,693
Met a lot of people here,
lot of good friends,

96
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:35,495
- like to keep 'em here.
- Right.

97
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,130
Okay.

98
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:42,867
What people are seeing
is kind of like a ghost

99
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,935
but with a black sheet on it.

100
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:48,068
Everybody thinks that it
was a devil or a monster,

101
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,139
but it's a person.

102
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:54,773
He goes under, uh, in the ground,

103
00:04:54,775 --> 00:05:01,272
and he's, like,
always kicking, uh, the floor.

104
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:04,809
Then he was showing me, like,
spinning the structure.

105
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:09,277
Obviously it doesn't spin,
but I think structurally, you know,

106
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,579
it has issues all the time

107
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,817
because he's kind of [bleep]
with the whole thing.

108
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,626
This thing that's under the ground

109
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:28,296
causes a lot of the stuff
that's happening here.

110
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:32,464
And I would think that most people

111
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,304
probably are also thinking

112
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:41,343
that there's some kind of poltergeist,
but it's not.

113
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,713
He's in his little hole,

114
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:50,653
and he projects his energy
and affects the surroundings.

115
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,059
What's going on in here?

116
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,262
We have a lot of things
moving around in this kitchen.

117
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:01,894
We're concerned about that.

118
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,328
For example,
the broom going across the room.

119
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,431
The bartender...

120
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,667
There was nobody in the kitchen at the time,

121
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,535
and the bartender heard a lot of noise...

122
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,503
Okay.

123
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,636
Came out and saw the broom

124
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,305
is in the middle of the floor here,

125
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,609
and she knew that the last
time she walked out there

126
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,980
she saw it on the wall back there.

127
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:20,315
Okay. Nobody was in the kitchen?

128
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,817
- Nobody was in the kitchen.
- Okay.

129
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,253
So now,
has anything else happened in this place?

130
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,255
Yes. The day that I purchased the building,

131
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:30,527
I walked through the door,
walked past the dishwasher

132
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,799
and stopped for some reason
and took a glance at it,

133
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,836
and it just squirted me in
the face twice real quick.

134
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:40,239
We had some, um,
more issues with plumbing with faucets

135
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,374
going on and off.

136
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,943
Lot of things that seem, like,

137
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,077
to try to disrupt the
business it seems like.

138
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:55,020
He has a lot of energy.

139
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,490
It'll affect everything structurally,

140
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:01,792
you know, like, water, uh, plumbing.

141
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,563
It's a lot of him. A lot of him.

142
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:07,297
Can you describe what he looks like?

143
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,998
And he's, like, squished himself out,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,133
'cause he's in the ground, you know,

145
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:15,538
and, uh, just has his legs,
which are always kicking.

146
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,743
It's very strange.

147
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,357
So, Leslie,
thanks for taking the time to talk to me.

148
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,824
You've been working here for a while?

149
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:32,028
About 17 years. Bartender and waitress.

150
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,098
I've heard about all the
things that are happening here.

151
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,298
Um, what about yourself? Any experiences?

152
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,333
Quite a few.

153
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,804
I had somebody tap me on the shoulder.

154
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,406
Okay. Where were you?

155
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:44,075
I was at the computer station.

156
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,544
No one was around me.

157
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:46,546
You're sure about that?

158
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,248
Yeah. There was nobody there.

159
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,349
And anything else?

160
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,752
I was leaving one night

161
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:55,324
and saw someone standing on the third floor

162
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,959
in the window in the hallway.

163
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,899
Okay. Was it a guest?

164
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:03,035
No. There were no guests that night.

165
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,136
I'm the last one here,

166
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,971
and I know if the hotel
rooms are rented or not

167
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,574
because we're the check-in.

168
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,878
Okay. Describe the man to me.

169
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,947
Tall and broad-shouldered, dark suit.

170
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,081
A suit?

171
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,683
Yeah, like, old-fashioned suit, bowler hat.

172
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,851
Okay.

173
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,419
Now, Leslie, you've been here...

174
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:23,620
What? Almost 17 years.

175
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,920
I mean, how you dealing with this?

176
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,788
I mean, why do you stay?

177
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,289
I love the place,

178
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:32,699
but if I felt a definite threat, I would...

179
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:35,066
I would probably not be here.

180
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,409
There's a male here.

181
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,078
He is a workaholic.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,213
He's always moving around.
He's always working.

183
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,547
Uh, I think that they do see him.

184
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,584
Mostly it's just solid,
normal-looking person.

185
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:06,131
I think the,
uh... workaholic doesn't like people up here.

186
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,165
He's mad.

187
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,103
Came right to the door and was like, "Aah!"

188
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,409
Oh, lordy.

189
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:19,477
He hates this [bleep]

190
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:23,015
Oh, damn. Oh, geez.

191
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,417
Okay. He's freaking the [bleep] out.

192
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:29,555
He's yelling, "Get out of here!"

193
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:32,959
You know, "Leave me alone!"

194
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:39,533
He invokes such rage in people.

195
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:44,302
I don't know how they're
not killing each other.

196
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:07,029
Now, how long did you work here?

197
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,064
About four years. I bartended.

198
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,200
I was talking to Danny.

199
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,669
He said a lot of the employees

200
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,704
quit over the stuff that happened here.

201
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,438
What was the feeling like
for you when you worked here?

202
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,674
I would experience fear

203
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,679
almost as if I was a child again

204
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,779
locked in a dark bedroom

205
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,416
with demons under my bed
and monsters in my closet.

206
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,021
That's how bad it was?

207
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,555
What about experiences? Have you had any?

208
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:31,822
Yes.

209
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:37,962
When I was closing the bar,
I witnessed a shadow

210
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:42,966
that actually resembled
a man directly behind me,

211
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,937
and it was, like, 7, 8 foot tall.

212
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,074
What did you do?

213
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,941
I was in shock.
I didn't really know what to do,

214
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,376
and from that point,

215
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:53,715
- I was just, like, "I have seen a ghost."
- Geez.

216
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,084
- You have anything else?
- Yes.

217
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,520
I was working in here,

218
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,254
and I was pushing in the barstools,

219
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:03,323
and I got to about this barstool right here

220
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,395
and as I went to push it in,
it almost just moved for me.

221
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,698
Show me what happened when
the chair moved on you.

222
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,832
Okay.

223
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:13,303
I put my foot on it and grabbed here,

224
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,139
and then I went to push it,
and as I went to push it,

225
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,811
it was almost, like,
it just moved for me so gracefully.

226
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,978
All right. Now, these are heavy.

227
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,445
They're not...

228
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,280
Right.

229
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:27,482
These aren't light.

230
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,285
I mean, you got to push it.

231
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,322
I can't even try to debunk that.

232
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,622
I just really feel like
there's something here.

233
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:41,933
The workaholic, he's pissed off.

234
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,801
I mean, he's doing things with the chairs.

235
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:53,011
I feel like he has pushed
living people definitely.

236
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,883
You know, he's like, "This is my space."

237
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,118
"Get out of the way, 'cause here I come."

238
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,492
And definitely they got to
feel this [bleep] energy,

239
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,629
like, it is so intense.

240
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:12,935
It is so directed.

241
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:17,843
I just feel like massive amounts of tension,

242
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:22,413
the heart, you know, just [bleep] pound...

243
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,748
Like, I'd almost think some people,

244
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,916
they can't [bleep] breathe here.

245
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,691
Now, Kathy, I understand

246
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,158
that you actually worked at
the hotel for a little bit.

247
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,159
- Is that right?
- Yes.

248
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,461
I worked there for about six months,

249
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:41,166
but I've been a customer for about 15 years.

250
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:42,434
Now, did you stop working there

251
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,669
because of what was going on?

252
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,838
That was a very big part of it.

253
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,706
Yeah. I read the signs.

254
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,341
You know, somebody was warning me

255
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:50,641
about something, so, um... Okay.

256
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,941
Now,
what kind of things are we talking about?

257
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,846
When I was a patron sitting
at the bar one evening,

258
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:59,152
um, I turned,
and I saw two apparitions in booth one.

259
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,322
Okay. How do you know they were apparitions?

260
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:05,428
I said to the waitress,
"You've got people in booth one?"

261
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,032
And she turned and said,
"Kath, there's nobody there."

262
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:08,967
So it couldn't have been

263
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,137
a mirror reflection of anything?

264
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,572
No. There's no mirror anywhere near it.

265
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:12,773
- Near it.
- Nope.

266
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,908
Anything else?

267
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,879
One full moon night, the bar was closed,

268
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,882
and looked up, and on the third floor,

269
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:21,522
I saw a man in the middle window,

270
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:25,257
and it was like he was looking
up and down the street.

271
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:26,858
You know,
you're the second person to tell me that.

272
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,058
What'd he look like?

273
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,363
He had a fedora,
so he kind of resembled a gangster.

274
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

275
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,029
Would you recognize him

276
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,896
if you saw him in a photo or a sketch?

277
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,264
I believe so. Yes. Mm-hmm.

278
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:39,500
Anything else?

279
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,337
When I was working and
I was doing the dishes,

280
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,641
- I was by the, uh, sink...
- Okay.

281
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:47,473
And I felt a tug on my apron.

282
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,039
Was anybody walking by you at the time?

283
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,303
No. No.

284
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:53,302
'Cause I looked around,
and there was nobody around me.

285
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,771
So you've had a lot of experiences there.

286
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,540
What do you think is going on in this place?

287
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,707
There's no question in my mind

288
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,608
that there's something evil there.

289
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,913
The workaholic likes this floor.

290
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:09,447
He is, like,
putting pillows on people's faces.

291
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:18,458
He does not like, um,
drug addicts and whores.

292
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,966
His thing of, you know,
getting the people [bleep] up,

293
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,199
and he's smothering 'em.

294
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,334
He's trying to kill 'em

295
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,371
with the [bleep] smothering 'em to death.

296
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,575
Somehow made it look like a heart attack.

297
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:39,751
Makes me feel very
uncomfortable and panicked.

298
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:48,327
There's some talk he may have killed someone

299
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:50,361
after he is dead.

300
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,359
Dan and his
employees didn't know much

301
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,229
about the history of the Barbee Hotel,

302
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,534
so I'm at the local library
to see what I can find.

303
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,735
Searching through old records,
I find a man named Joseph Plu

304
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,904
who used to live on my client's
property in the late 1800s.

305
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:23,641
Turns out he was accused
of a brutal double murder

306
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:24,975
at his neighbor's house.

307
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,016
I've called on my old friend Butch Barile.

308
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,517
He's a local retired detective.

309
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,484
He said he'd dig into the case for me

310
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,318
and tell me exactly what happened.

311
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:44,752
February of 1887,
I come across an article,

312
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:47,751
this kid Joseph Plu who got
charged with a double murder

313
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:50,021
right on the property I'm investigating.

314
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,289
What were you able to find out?

315
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,623
Joseph Plu lived on your client's land

316
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:00,896
with his grandparents
next to a Henry Dunham,

317
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,563
who had hired Joseph Plu

318
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,798
to work and help him on his farm.

319
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,167
So, what kind of a crime
scene are we looking at?

320
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,167
What happened?

321
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,467
So, it was, uh...

322
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,103
it was a pretty grisly crime scene.

323
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:17,378
Henry, he had a 20-month-old baby,
a daughter,

324
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,913
and her throat was slit ear to ear.

325
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:22,951
The other victim was Henry himself.

326
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,219
Okay.

327
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:28,023
He was found out in the yard
with several stab wounds

328
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:32,159
and, uh, it's thought that hogs got to him.

329
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,996
His body was completely mutilated

330
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,498
and half-eaten, literally.

331
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:42,307
I see, like, somebody's face being [bleep]

332
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,309
I feel like it's a male.

333
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,714
He's, like, very much in pain right now,

334
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,716
and he can't breathe.

335
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:54,186
Ow!

336
00:16:55,822 --> 00:17:01,792
Something... got hit in the head,
maybe, here.

337
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:04,262
I know there's a few people.

338
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:07,500
There's more than one.

339
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:10,671
I think he's just in his death state.

340
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:14,375
There's so much pain in my head.

341
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,945
Oh, my God.

342
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,750
So what happens next?

343
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:21,887
A neighbor happened to be
walking near the property,

344
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,654
found him laying there,

345
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:27,023
went inside the house and found Lucy Dunham,

346
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:31,065
Henry's wife,
who was just barely clinging to life.

347
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,732
She also had several stab wounds

348
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,634
and... and severe head injuries.

349
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:36,669
So now, at the time,

350
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,438
Plu lived on my client's property,

351
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,474
and I'm assuming now that
'cause she survived,

352
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,343
she identifies him as the perp.

353
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:45,549
She identifies him, but also she knew

354
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:48,551
there were two other people there,

355
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,954
but she couldn't identify either one of 'em.

356
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:53,191
Now, there's a lot of rage in this case,

357
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:55,861
and what would motivate this kid,
Plu, to do this?

358
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,196
My understanding is that
there was a lot of animosity

359
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,431
between him and the wife.

360
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,799
- Okay.
- They'd have some confrontations

361
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:02,933
and some problems.

362
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:05,234
- He didn't really care for her.
- Okay.

363
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,836
In fact, I think they'd had some problems

364
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,871
with Mr. Dunham arguing over,
you know, over pay.

365
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:14,475
Joseph Plu, he had some... some cash on him.

366
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:17,346
He had $90, my understanding was,

367
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:21,282
and I think some of it
had bloodstains on it.

368
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,687
Okay.

369
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,155
You and I both know that this
is not the type of murder,

370
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,489
especially with this baby
that you commit over $85...

371
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:28,792
No... or whatever money.

372
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:31,264
No, not at all.

373
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:34,332
It was, uh, some, you know,
severe hatred involved.

374
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,702
Wow. Okay.

375
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:40,341
There's a dead lady.

376
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,310
She's, like, hanging on.

377
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:45,547
She's, like, hanging on to my leg.

378
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,253
She's, like, being dragged across the floor.

379
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:52,992
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

380
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,160
She, like...

381
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,896
I don't know what the
[bleep] happened to her, man.

382
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,264
She got [bleep]

383
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,334
I think that somebody killed her.

384
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:08,743
There's a couple of men around her.

385
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:09,809
I feel them.

386
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:13,614
She knew one for sure.

387
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:16,318
Why is my friend doing this?

388
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,088
Someone says it's a brutal
assault with a little knife.

389
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,494
I feel like someone got stabbed.

390
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,296
Uh...

391
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,631
Okay. So now, Plu gets charged.

392
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,199
Does he get convicted? What's the story?

393
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,235
Plu does get charged and gets convicted,

394
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:42,508
and he, uh... he takes a life sentence.

395
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,676
All right.

396
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:46,444
So, does this kid end up
dying in jail or what?

397
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:50,917
No. So, what happens is he
ends up serving 29 years.

398
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,457
Henry Dunham's wife comes back and says

399
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,860
that she can't confirm for
sure that he did do it.

400
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,230
After 29 years.

401
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,767
After 29 years,
so he gets a pardon and he gets out.

402
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,967
Wow.

403
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,907
And this is Plu 29 years later

404
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,510
when he gets released.

405
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,414
Now, how old is Plu when he gets out?

406
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,347
He's 53.

407
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,551
All right. So he get's pardoned.

408
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:19,323
Do they look at anybody else as a suspect?

409
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,523
No.

410
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:24,127
It's still, for all practical purposes...

411
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:25,730
- Unsolved?
- ...unsolved.

412
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:33,004
This dead guy,
someone's calling him derogatory names.

413
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,639
What do they say?

414
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,876
They're saying that he's gay and stuff.

415
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:40,114
What are you shaking your head about?

416
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:43,920
I don't understand how this
could be such a violent place.

417
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:49,056
It's too much.

418
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:53,196
Makes me feel very
uncomfortable and panicked.

419
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:58,036
I feel very, very sad, like I want to cry.

420
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,832
One of the first things I do on a case

421
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,467
is reach out to local historians.

422
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:23,972
Usually I don't turn up too much,
but in this case,

423
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:25,741
a local genealogist tells me

424
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,977
that the man that built
Dan's hotel has a wild story

425
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,343
and I'm definitely gonna want to hear it.

426
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:39,482
Well, Beth, thanks for meeting me.

427
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:40,584
I appreciate that.

428
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,187
You mentioned on the phone

429
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,654
that the guy that originally built the hotel

430
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,291
on the property I'm investigating

431
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,028
had an interesting story behind him?

432
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,698
Yes. His name was Henry Hover.

433
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,567
He was a farmer.

434
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:55,505
This is a photo that we
found when he was farming.

435
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:59,045
He... you can see he's at
the end of the photo here.

436
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:02,115
Okay. So, how does he go from being a farmer

437
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:03,585
to building a hotel?

438
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:08,291
He started amassing that property in 1880,

439
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,993
and it took him 17 years,

440
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:14,495
but in 1897, he got the hotel.

441
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:18,264
These are the photos of
the hotel that we have.

442
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:21,968
He... he just stuck to his vision.

443
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,169
Okay. So now he has his dream hotel.

444
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,270
What happens?

445
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:26,739
Does he live there happily ever after?

446
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,942
I mean, what's the story?

447
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:31,112
No. Henry just has one
tragedy after another.

448
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:33,613
1897, the year the hotel's built,

449
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:35,917
he loses a son Ira who's sick.

450
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,751
He dies of unknown causes.

451
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:41,958
In 1901,
his wife loses a child in childbirth.

452
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,524
The biggest tragedy happened in 1902,

453
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:47,193
when he lost his 3-year-old son, Elmer,

454
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:49,396
to an accident.

455
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:52,966
Elmer is playing in the hotel.

456
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,868
They work there. They live there.

457
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,203
He's trying to climb on top of a bean sack

458
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,273
to get up to the counter.

459
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:03,144
His foot slips and his
little chin hits the counter,

460
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,643
and broke his neck.

461
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:07,879
Within 20 minutes, little Elmer is gone.

462
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:10,451
So what happens after all this?

463
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:11,986
He runs into financial trouble,

464
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:15,757
and in 1906, sells the hotel for a loss.

465
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,629
Okay.

466
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,797
He dies at the age of 68

467
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,633
after being confined in bed
for a year from tuberculosis.

468
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:26,469
- You're kidding me?
- Nope.

469
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,272
So what happened with the hotel?

470
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,510
It burned down in the 1920s,

471
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:34,813
and the hotel you see today is a rebuild,

472
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,383
but it looks very similar to the original.

473
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:47,862
I want to say that he... owned this place

474
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:55,565
or was in charge of this place,
um, or thinks he is still.

475
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:59,235
The workaholic guy?

476
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,703
Yes.

477
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,472
Do you know anything about
what he was like in life?

478
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,777
He's, like, between 55 and 60.

479
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,283
He came from a... a hardworking background,

480
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:16,661
and he feels he did well
until this happened.

481
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:22,069
He's still acting like he is working.

482
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:26,041
He just goes and he just
does what he did every day.

483
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:29,146
That's what makes him feel comfortable.

484
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,422
Beth mentioned that Dan's
building ended up burning down.

485
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:41,258
Obviously,
I need to find out exactly what happened.

486
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,493
I'm heading over to meet
with a local firefighter.

487
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:48,167
He says the cause of the fire
is still a mystery to this day.

488
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:56,376
Well, Chief, thanks for meeting me.

489
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:57,411
I appreciate it.

490
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,079
So now, the expert I talked to said

491
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,545
that the hotel I'm investigating
burnt down in the '20s,

492
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,780
- and you said it was true.
- Absolutely.

493
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,950
August 18, 1921,

494
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:08,285
the fire completely destroyed the hotel.

495
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,452
Okay.

496
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,719
This is one of the articles.

497
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,255
What was the story with it?

498
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:15,496
The fire started in the attic area

499
00:25:15,498 --> 00:25:16,764
and then it went

500
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,535
and it slowly started to
burn across the attic.

501
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:22,238
Okay. Now, what about casualties, anything?

502
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,538
It's my understanding

503
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,741
that there was roughly 50 people there

504
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:27,946
when the fire started, and not a one of them

505
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:30,082
suffered an injury or a death.

506
00:25:30,084 --> 00:25:31,715
Okay.
So, they were able to get everybody out...

507
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:33,184
- Yes...
- before the building collapsed.

508
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:34,486
All right. So, do we know, Chief,

509
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:35,821
exactly what even started the fire?

510
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,790
The articles I've read said
spontaneous combustion.

511
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,393
There was no electrical wiring in the attic,

512
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:42,694
so they ruled that out

513
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:45,097
and they went to spontaneous combustion.

514
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,865
All right. So, in your opinion,
though, what do you think?

515
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,367
I don't know that we'll ever know.

516
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:57,109
There's been a lot of
things that have happened.

517
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,712
It's kind of crazy.

518
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,882
There was a fire, but I don't know

519
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:07,717
if it was actually this structure

520
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,352
or if there was another structure.

521
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,325
It's residual, but it happened.

522
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:27,566
I saw several dead people on my walk,

523
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:30,773
but the workaholic is
the most advanced entity.

524
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,241
I'm meeting with an artist

525
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:34,342
to describe how he appeared in life.

526
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:42,288
He's probably between
55 and 60 years of age.

527
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,860
He has a very thick, full head of gray hair.

528
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:52,066
His nose has been probably
broken a few times.

529
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,279
Yes. That's what I saw.

530
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:26,303
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

531
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:29,341
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

532
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,708
and our clients for the first time.

533
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,042
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Dan.

534
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:36,112
He is the owner of this restaurant/hotel

535
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,448
for about eight years now.

536
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,982
Activity here is bad and it's getting worse,

537
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:44,148
and it's hurting his business
and if it keeps going like this,

538
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,115
he's gonna have to shut the place down.

539
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,484
Leslie here has worked here for 17 years?

540
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,386
She's had ton of experiences,

541
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,123
and I kind of think she's
numb to it at this point.

542
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,353
Now, Kathy lives directly across the street.

543
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:56,787
She's been here for 15 years.

544
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,458
She actually worked in the
restaurant for six months.

545
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,093
She thinks that whatever's here is evil,

546
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,061
and that Dan and his
staff could be in danger.

547
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,399
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

548
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,036
I'm gonna have her talk about her walk.

549
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,479
So one of the first things that I got

550
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:19,351
when I got out of the vehicle

551
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:21,087
was that there had been a fire here.

552
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,722
I was smelling it and tasting it,

553
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:27,194
and I felt like people were
breathing in the smoke,

554
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:29,795
and I didn't know if it was this structure

555
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,195
or a structure nearby.

556
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:33,796
Well, you hit that pretty much on the head.

557
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,199
Now, the hotel opened in 1897.

558
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:39,568
It was opened up as the Hotel Ormond.

559
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,703
But back on August 18, 1921,
the building caught on fire.

560
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,537
It started in the attic.

561
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,741
They tried dousing it out,
but you know what?

562
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:48,642
They had no shot.

563
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,843
Now, nobody died in that fire,

564
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:54,581
but there were 50 people
staying here at the time,

565
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,746
but they all got out safely,
and I have an article here about it.

566
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:01,450
Now, two years later, the hotel was rebuilt

567
00:29:01,452 --> 00:29:02,916
and that's the building we're in right now.

568
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:04,017
That makes sense.

569
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:10,493
One of the first conscious entities

570
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:13,563
that I encountered was on the first floor.

571
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:17,133
Um, so he was really strange,
because what I saw him doing

572
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:21,038
was, like, burrowing under the ground.

573
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,808
And he's, like,
always kicking, uh, the floor.

574
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:31,348
Then he was showing me, like,
spinning the structure.

575
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,384
I think structurally, you know,
it has issues all the time

576
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:37,053
because he's kind of [bleep]
with the whole thing.

577
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:40,122
But what I saw as a direct result of that

578
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:43,794
was causing issues with, like, plumbing

579
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:46,965
or electricity or things breaking.

580
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,431
Dan, the first day in this place,

581
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,366
you had issues with the water, right?

582
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:56,499
Yes. As I walked in and
walked past the dishwasher,

583
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:59,037
and stopped and turned and
looked at it for some reason,

584
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,142
and, um,
it squirted me right in the face twice.

585
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:04,411
I mean, you've been here the longest.

586
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:05,613
Long time.

587
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:07,783
So, as far as the structural issues,

588
00:30:07,785 --> 00:30:10,287
has this been ongoing?

589
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:11,621
Yeah.

590
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:12,689
I mean, some of it you chalk
up to it's an old building.

591
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:16,625
But we have a lot of electrical glitches

592
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:17,693
and computer glitches.

593
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:19,328
That happens a lot.

594
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,496
Interesting.

595
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:26,635
Okay. So what else did you see?

596
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:28,171
During my walk, I came across

597
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,940
a couple of murder scenes,

598
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:33,278
and one of them involved
a female in the bar area.

599
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,181
So I walk over there

600
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:39,819
and this woman, like,
grabbed on to my lower legs

601
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:42,289
and was, like,
dragging herself on the floor.

602
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,558
She was beaten.

603
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,827
There were three men that
were involved at least.

604
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:50,869
She knew one of them most certainly.

605
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:53,338
I kept hearing, like,
while all this chaos is going on,

606
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,539
like, the guys were laughing.

607
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,672
It was excruciatingly painful.

608
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:01,006
The next murder victim I encountered

609
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,139
was a male outside

610
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:04,240
who was stuck in his death state.

611
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:08,475
I started feeling like a
really sharp pain in my chest,

612
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:11,043
and so I think he was stabbed.

613
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:14,311
And I'm hearing these men clearly,
like, yelling at me,

614
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:16,282
like, horrible, really awful things.

615
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:20,152
And I think there was some
kind of issue with him

616
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:22,621
where these males might have thought

617
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,691
that he was a homosexual or
something of that nature.

618
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:27,425
There was a double murder

619
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,326
that had strong connection to this place.

620
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:31,694
It happened in 1887.

621
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:34,563
A guy by the name of Joseph Plu lived here.

622
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:37,131
Now, I got a photo of him.

623
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:40,067
Now, he lived next door to
a guy named Henry Dunham.

624
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,236
And now, Henry lived on the property

625
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:44,005
with his wife and 20-month-old daughter.

626
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,472
So he needed to hire somebody
to work on the farm for him,

627
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:47,439
and he hired this guy.

628
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:51,543
Now, on February 7, 1887,

629
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:53,446
this is when a brutal crime takes place.

630
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:54,747
Henry was stabbed repeatedly.

631
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:58,820
They find Henry in the barn area outside.

632
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:01,289
He's stabbed to death
and his body's mutilated

633
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:04,157
because he had hogs on the property

634
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,924
that basically went to town on him,
and they ate him.

635
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:10,927
Now, inside,
his 20-month-old daughter was also murdered.

636
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,328
It was pretty brutal.

637
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,127
She was cut from ear to ear,

638
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:16,627
practically almost right to the point

639
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:18,362
where her head was cut off.

640
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:21,633
His wife Lucy was stabbed
several times and beaten,

641
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,434
but she survived actually.

642
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:25,971
This is where it gets interesting.

643
00:32:25,973 --> 00:32:27,875
She told the cops that
there were three attackers,

644
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:29,675
and one of them was Plu.

645
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,545
She's like, "Yeah.
It was him and two other guys,"

646
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,248
that she couldn't identify.

647
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,214
He's the only one that gets charged.

648
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:38,418
29 years later, Lucy comes back and says,

649
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,820
"I'm not sure Plu was at the crime scene."

650
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:42,056
This is after the guy's
in jail for 29 years.

651
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:43,423
So why would she retract that?

652
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:46,025
Your guess is as good as mine.

653
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,127
It's still a mystery to this day, this case.

654
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,562
This is actually a picture
of Plu when he came out,

655
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:54,397
29 years later.

656
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,433
This is, uh... this is him.

657
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,102
Did you know about any of this?

658
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:00,839
'Cause you seem upset about it,

659
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,343
and I know it's a terrible story.

660
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:05,611
When she spoke about the woman,

661
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:09,813
um... I've gotten feelings about,

662
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:13,546
uh, a lady, um, that was, uh, raped

663
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:15,647
and... and murdered.

664
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:16,848
So I felt it.

665
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,721
You know, it was, uh,
by more than just one person.

666
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:24,188
Her spirit had came through me

667
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,224
and talked with me

668
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:30,590
and, uh... um, she... she's,
like, telling me

669
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,359
that she was forced to retract that.

670
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,296
Oh, interesting. Okay.

671
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:36,799
Well, let me ask you a question.
Do you think she has abilities?

672
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,632
Yes.

673
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,133
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, I do.

674
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:45,270
It seems to me that she wants people

675
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,872
to know exactly what happened.

676
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:51,145
She wants, you know, the truth to be told.

677
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:53,815
I think it was him.

678
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,384
They raped her.

679
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,321
All right.

680
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:01,756
So what else happened on your walk?

681
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:03,624
One of the people that I encountered,

682
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,291
he seemed to me to be

683
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,895
the most physically
present dead person here.

684
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:13,800
And he came off very much
as like a workaholic,

685
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,806
but when I went upstairs, very different.

686
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,172
He was like, "Get the [bleep] out of there.

687
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,742
This is... this is my... my space."

688
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:27,315
One of the ways that he
sometimes shows himself

689
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:31,319
is as a tall, shadow-type figure.

690
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,787
Now, you've seen a guy

691
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,492
in the window upstairs, though, right?

692
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:36,659
- A tall guy?
- Yes.

693
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,192
And when I've seen him,

694
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,594
he was just, like, looking down

695
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:43,463
each side of the street as to see if he...

696
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,301
he's looking for someone,

697
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:46,969
like a lookout-type of a guy.

698
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:48,369
Mm-hmm.

699
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:51,772
You saw it leaving work
one day when nobody's here.

700
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:52,905
Yeah.

701
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,775
There was nobody in the
building when I left.

702
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:56,145
Mm-hmm.

703
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:57,947
Did you get any sense

704
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:59,613
of who this guy might have
been when he was alive?

705
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:04,588
He worked his whole life
to do well for himself,

706
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,721
and he felt like he did do well for himself.

707
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:10,094
I thought that he either owned this place

708
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:11,997
or was in charge of this place.

709
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:15,997
And, uh, he thinks that he's still...

710
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,799
- Running it...
- running it.

711
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:21,539
Uh, I got that he was
between 55 and 60 years old.

712
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:28,278
His moods seemed to be
very drastic ups and downs,

713
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,546
ups and downs.

714
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:31,515
And he's still like that.

715
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:35,122
Well,
it makes me think of the guy Henry Hover

716
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,522
that originally built this place.

717
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,590
Now, he was a hard worker,
he was a workaholic.

718
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:40,859
He was a farmer.

719
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,564
In 1880,
he started buying little pieces of land.

720
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:47,868
Took him 17 years to buy the
property and build this hotel,

721
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,437
which was his dream.

722
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:54,075
I have the only known photo of this guy,

723
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:55,543
and it's not a very good one.

724
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:00,415
You mentioned he was an emotional wreck.

725
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,719
Well, he lost his son Ira at the age of 6

726
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:05,090
from unknown causes from what we can tell.

727
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,360
1901, his wife lost a baby boy at birth,

728
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:10,664
and then in 1902,
the biggest tragedy happened

729
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:15,271
to this guy, his 3-year-old son,
Elmer, fell off a bag of beans.

730
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,337
He was playing in the hotel,

731
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,271
and the fall broke the poor kid's neck.

732
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:21,706
And he basically died about 20 minutes later

733
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,106
after they found him.

734
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,108
To make matters worse for this guy, in 1906,

735
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,377
he comes into some hard times financially

736
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,746
and has to sell this place at a great loss.

737
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:31,949
Now, did you get a good look at the guy?

738
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,916
Yes, I did.

739
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,319
And I had a sketch done of him.

740
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,386
Okay.

741
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,292
Take a look at this.

742
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:56,111
The sketch looks exactly
like this man right here.

743
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,447
Looks just like him.

744
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,817
- This sketch you did looks just like Plu...
- Right.

745
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:05,420
The more I'm looking at it.

746
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:06,955
Oh, my gosh.

747
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,658
Yeah. It all makes sense. Okay.

748
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:29,544
- This sketch you did looks just like Plu...
- Right.

749
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,444
The more I'm looking at it.

750
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:32,578
Oh, my gosh.

751
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,410
Yeah. It all makes sense. Okay.

752
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,619
It matches, like,
the murder that he did on that guy,

753
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,788
the things he was saying.

754
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,025
Yeah. It totally makes sense.

755
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:51,459
So do you think this guy Plu

756
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:54,864
is the guy that you ran
into on the second floor?

757
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,097
- Yeah.
- Okay. 'Cause it makes sense.

758
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,730
And the second and third floor for sure.
Yeah.

759
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,967
So how'd this guy Plu make you think

760
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,369
he was the workaholic on the top floors?

761
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:06,404
Because there's so much
residual information,

762
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:12,817
I feel like he's able to,
you know, almost disguise himself

763
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,351
within all of this information that exists.

764
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:19,089
The third floor, the second floor,
and the underneath,

765
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,389
I think is all the same person.

766
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:22,256
Okay. So, the guy that you encountered

767
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,421
- that's kicking the fl...
- Yeah.

768
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:26,426
- Making the pipes burst.
- Yes.

769
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:29,029
The aggressive guy on the
second floor we think is Plu.

770
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:30,196
Yeah.

771
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:31,996
And the third floor guy... Which is Plu.

772
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:33,763
- Is all the same guy.
- Yeah. It's all the same guy.

773
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:40,836
But now it seems to be
getting more physical.

774
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,974
So you think this guy
wants people out of here?

775
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:46,279
Yes.

776
00:38:46,281 --> 00:38:49,750
I see this guy taking pillows

777
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:51,654
and putting them over living people's faces

778
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:54,191
and trying to kill them,

779
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:56,128
but he's made it look like a heart attack

780
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,230
or things like that.

781
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,800
So he's capable of killing living people?

782
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:00,801
Yes.

783
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:02,371
He'll, like, target people he doesn't like,

784
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,311
like drug addicts and homosexuals.

785
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:10,917
You know, Kathy,
earlier you mentioned to me that you're gay.

786
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:12,520
Is it okay if we talk about that?

787
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,889
Yes.

788
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:18,327
Now, is it bothering you that
he might have been targeting you

789
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:19,329
because of your lifestyle?

790
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:20,564
Now it is.

791
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,401
I think he was targeting
me not only because of that

792
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,337
but also the fact that I was able to connect

793
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:28,739
with... with the lady,

794
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:33,645
and so I'm thinking he's like,
"Not only is she gay,

795
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:36,744
but she also can communicate
with these other spirits,

796
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:38,478
and now I'm... I'm threatened."

797
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,113
Dan,
when you said it was getting worse here,

798
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,345
you weren't kidding.

799
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,555
Well, Dan, we know one thing for sure.

800
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,456
Kathy was right. This place is dangerous.

801
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,856
But the big question is,

802
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,460
can you make it safe for your
employees and your guests?

803
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,196
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to my partner, Amy.

804
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,365
The first concern I have

805
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:06,637
is that I think some of the
activity might get... bad,

806
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,172
and I don't think he's going
to be happy about the fact

807
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:14,334
that all his cards are on the table.

808
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:21,669
I am very nervous about
how he's going to react,

809
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:25,671
so I definitely would suggest
that people not stay here

810
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,109
until it can be dealt with.

811
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,512
I'm certainly shaken.

812
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:34,476
All right.
So how do we get rid of this [bleep]

813
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:39,346
It needs to be, like,
a massive hit against him.

814
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:43,615
I would like there to be a psychic knower

815
00:40:43,617 --> 00:40:46,950
to come with two male mediums,

816
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:50,517
and they all need to work at the same time.

817
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:53,419
The psychic knower is
going to be taking care

818
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,187
of the residual that's here,

819
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:58,187
and the mediums are going to be dealing

820
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,122
with the conscious dead that are here,

821
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:02,557
and there's a lot.

822
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,228
And I want two badass male mediums,

823
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,896
very aggressive, very strong.

824
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:08,930
Why?

825
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,595
He'll get intimidated a little

826
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,927
and he needs to be intimidated.

827
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,964
Also, I don't want any other
living people in the building

828
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,732
when they're doing this,

829
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,466
'cause I also feel that
they could be attacked.

830
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:24,332
All right.

831
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,234
And now, once that's done,
the things will be okay here?

832
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:30,874
It'll be very quiet, void of everything.

833
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,877
It'll feel very, very, very different.

834
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,011
I'm just... I'm... I'm thinking

835
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:38,815
that I'm gonna miss this place for a while.

836
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:41,955
Once this [bleep] out of here,
she'll be safe to come back.

837
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,722
- Yeah.
- Okay.

838
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,156
Yes.

839
00:41:45,158 --> 00:41:46,858
Thank you.

840
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,664
So you're gonna take our advice, I assume.

841
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,831
Absolutely.

842
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,331
Can't wait to get rid of him.

843
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,169
It won't be easy removing the dead man

844
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:57,440
wreaking havoc on this restaurant/hotel,

845
00:41:57,442 --> 00:42:00,042
but I believe if Dan follows my advice,

846
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:01,910
the evil here will be banished,

847
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:05,249
keeping Dan and his employees
and guests safe from harm.
