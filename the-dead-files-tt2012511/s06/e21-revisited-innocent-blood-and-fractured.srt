00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,583
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,218
How the hell are you sleeping

NARRATOR:
New information...

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,890
It really just took the breath
out of me.

9

NARRATOR:
...startling revelations.

10
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,660
I always knew
that they were here.

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,179
NARRATOR: First...

12

She did die poorly.

NARRATOR:...where
an other-worldly evil...

NARRATOR:
...targets the young.

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,846
They definitely had their sights
set on the children here.

NARRATOR: Then...

21
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,914
Something's trying
to harm my child.

very violent things.

what it takes to fight back?

It's not a game.
It's not.

Or are they still
under attack?

00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,420
I see dead people.

36
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,041
It seems like a devil.

37
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:34,661
I speak to dead people.

38
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:35,659
He's pissed off.

39
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,262
And they speak to me.

40
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,796
I felt real fear.

41
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,934
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

42
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,902
I think she's being murdered.

I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,741
Serial killer pops
in my head.

47
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,045
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

48
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,213
Nobody believes me.

49
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,647
It's my job to reveal them.

50
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,018
Do you think
there's still bodies there?
I do.

51
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,651
But Steve and I never speak...

52
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,688
We never communicate
during an investigation.

53
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,021
...until the very end.

54
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,656
You got problems.
I got news for you.

When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

STEVE:
We get hundreds of submissions

60

every week
from people looking for help,

61
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,351
but when kids are in harm's way
like in Rome, New York,

62
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,386
I know it's a case
Amy and I have to take on.

63
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,554
And once I heard
that Joe's wife, Sue,

00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,158
had already moved out once
with the children,

65
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,093
I knew
that this terrified family

66
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,162
was at the end of their rope.

67
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,299
STEVE: Give me an idea
of what you're going through.

68
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,700
We hear banging.

69
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,668
I've seen apparitions.

70
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,371
I've been
physically touched.

71
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,142
I've tried to make up
every excuse in the book

72
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,194
other than
it being paranormal.

73
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,177
SUE:
We called Steve and Amy

74

because of everything
that was going on here.

00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,119
I wanted to pretend
that it wasn't there,

77

but we needed some kind
of answers.

78
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,740
What really made me
believe in it

79
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,489
was when
my 8-year-old daughter,

80
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,059
you know, she heard
people talking --

81
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,759
whispering.

82
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,097
You had actually left with
the kids at one point, right?

83
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,866
Yes, I moved out
for 11 months.

[ Sniffles ]

85
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,804
I just couldn't take it
anymore.

86
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,438
I don't want my kids

87
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,743
to grow up experiencing
anything I have.

88

AMY: Even though
every location I visit

89
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,463
presents
it's own unique challenges,

90
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:57,336
there was something very unusual
about this walk.

91
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,791
So, in my opening,
I saw all of these thick trees,

92
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:06,211
and there were all these
Native American warriors

93
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,148
standing with their
bow and arrow drawn.

94
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,814
This Native American guy says

95
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,719
that there is some kind
of a family of beasts,

96
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,823
and they think
that they're ghosts.

97
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,892
These things
are occasionally trying

98
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,028
to enter the house.

99
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,198
They're very dark,

100
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,804
and they look
kind of like human beings,

101
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,272
but they're definitely not.

102
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,240
I faced something

103
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,912
I've only encountered
one other time -- aliens.

104
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,746
Were they living?

105
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,680
I don't know yet.

106
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,686
They just look creepy.

107
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,558
STEVE: Sue had mentioned
she was physically touched,

108
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,691
which is bad enough.

109
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,728
But when she told me more
about what happened,

110
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,994
it made total sense

111
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,965
why she and her daughters
moved out for nearly a year.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,902
There was an incident
in the living room on the couch.

113
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:06,439
Okay,
what happened?

114
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,941
I felt this...grope.

115
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,411
So, I'm assuming
it was forceful.

116
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,314
Okay.

that dent thing is?

120
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,962
About that tall.

121
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,131
These dark creatures
looked menacing,

122
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,235
and as I was able
to make out more details,

123
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,435
the situation looked worse.

124
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,075
Their head kind of jets forward
on a long neck

125
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,775
and they're hunched

126
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,179
and you can really see
their shoulder blades

127
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,549
and then really long arms
with the long fingers.

128
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,503
The way they surrounded
the house was threatening.

129
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,456
And suddenly, I saw
what they were looking for.

130
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,225
They definitely have
their sights set

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,961
on the children here.

132
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,263
Maybe, these are what

are fending off?

inherited the house
from his grandparents.

138

a secure place
to raise his family,

Joe was gonna have to choose

between the safety
of his wife and kids

three packs a day.

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,533
NARRATOR:
...lost souls lash out.

179
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,199
She was mutilated.

180
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,635
NARRATOR:...trapped
in a gruesome Hell.

181
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,570
Her head got chopped off.

182
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,874
NARRATOR: And in our second
investigation...

183
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,375
I think that I was pushed.

184
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,846
NARRATOR:
...evil spawns a dangerous game
of child's play.

185
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,716
He was pretty **** powerful.

186
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,496
STEVE: Even though both his
grandparents died there,

187
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,430
Joe had a lot of good memories
in that house,

188
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,600
but he might have been
the only one that felt that way.

189
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,003
Turns out
Joe's grandparents' death

190
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,336
was just the tip of the iceberg.

191
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,674
There was a lot more tragedy
attached to this problem.

192
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,387
It all seems to center around
this guy -- Henry J. Kobler.

193
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:21,293
It started at the age of 9
when his dad died.

194
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,163
His father
was about 34 years old

195
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,999
and passed away
of unknown reasons.

196
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,398
34 is young.

197
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,836
It is very young.
Okay.

198
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,037
But it continues.

199
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,071
In 1901,

200
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,774
his grandmother
was picking berries

201
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,374
one day on the property

202
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,280
and was attacked by a bull
and killed.

203
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,615
She was mutilated.

204
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,318
All right.

205
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:52,425
AMY: There's this crazy lady
who does run around outside.

206
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,764
And she did die poorly.

207
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,065
What do you mean?

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,170
Her head, you know,
it got chopped off --

209
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,939
or ripped off more.

210
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,443
It's not a nice, clean cut.

211
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,379
Oh, my gosh.

212
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,283
It's messy, very messy.

213
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,956
STEVE:
One tragic death on a property
would be bad luck,

214
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,824
two, maybe a coincidence.

215
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,129
But after what I found out next,
I couldn't deny there was

216
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,196
some sort of pattern
happening here.

217
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,600
This is probably
the darkest part of his life.

218
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,970
He had a daughter.

219
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,270
Her name was Ella.

220
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,909
And in 1920,
she was 16 years old,

221
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,778
and she was struck
by a car.

222
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,681
Wow.

223
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,952
She was an only child.

224
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,251
Oh, geez.

225
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,920
This guy can't catch a break,
can he?

226
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,387
Correct.

227
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,525
The tragedy in this guy's life
is overwhelming.

228
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,135
This Native American guy
is saying,

229
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,870
like, how it's not safe here.

230
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,240
There's no place
that's safe here.

231
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,107
Everyone's at risk.

232
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,977
The dark figures
I'd seen earlier

233
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,777
had disappeared for the moment.

234
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,849
And for the first time,
the spirits protecting this land

235
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,086
were able to tell me more
about the location.

236
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,154
He is saying

237
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,591
that it's just
for ghosts to live.

238
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:38,630
So he just wants to help
and clear the area out.

239
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,665
Of what?

240
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,104
Living people.

241
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,983
STEVE: By the time
I hit the local library,

242
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,450
I didn't think
there was anything left to find.

243
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,388
But I caught a lead
on another family
that lived there.

244
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,822
As it turned out,
their time on the property

245
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,728
was filled with nothing
but death and heartbreak.

246
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,870
Now, Mary,
when I did my research,

247
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,472
I came across
a couple of deaths

248
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,774
associated
with the Jocelyn family,

249
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,041
but you said
there was a lot more.

250
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,608
There was a lot more,
yes.
Okay.

251
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,045
How many
are we talking about?
They had 10 children.

252
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,814
And four of those children
died as babies.

253
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,682
And then they had

254
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,603
two young adults die
from tuberculosis,

255
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:37,490
which was very prevalent
in that era.

256
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:45,430
AMY: I'm seeing
those weird creatures again.

257
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,766
A lot of children
they would eat.

258
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,537
I do see, like,
the kids are being bit.

259
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,475
Open their chests.

260
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,777
Kids?

261
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:59,044
Kids.

262
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:05,349
It's pretty gross and sad.

263
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,583
NARRATOR: Coming up...

264
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,619
I'm getting so ****
out of here.

265
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,322
...what happened
after the investigation?

266
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,558
To all the beings,
seen and unseen,

267
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,061
heal this family.

268
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,382
STEVE: Amy, I'd like you
to meet Joe and Sue.

269
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,651
The activity in the house
is ripping them apart.

270
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,451
It got so bad last year,

271
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,620
Sue actually left
with the three kids.

272
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:47,659
The night of the reveal was,
you know, full of anxiety.

273
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,226
I was very apprehensive,

274
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,598
very nervous to find out
what they actually found.

275
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,802
I met this
older Native American man.

276
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,702
What he said was that this place

277
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,372
was not meant
for the living to be in.

278
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,877
STEVE: The first white settlers
on your land

279
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,111
was the Jocelyn family.

280
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,930
They had 10 kids.

281
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,714
Six of them died.

282
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,650
1874-- the Koblers
moved into your property.

283
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,189
Most of the tragedy surrounds
a guy named Henry J.

284
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,060
His father drops dead --
34 years old.

285
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,593
He gets married.

286
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,030
His 16-year-old daughter's
coming home on a bicycle.

287
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,531
She gets hits by a car
and killed.

288
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,768
I got a picture of her.

289
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,170
AMY: Wow.

290
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,440
So, it's like
there's nothing but death

291
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,176
surrounding this property.

292
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,948
AMY: A bit later
when I went upstairs,

293
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,316
I encountered an older man.

294
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,282
He looked Italian,

295
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:50,021
and when I was around him,
I couldn't breathe.

296
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,690
Like, I felt that he was
a very heavy smoker,

297
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:58,496
and he either died
of a heart attack or emphysema.

298
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:03,268
And I think that he died
in the 90s or early 2000s.

299
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,036
JOE: Grandpa
was a heavy smoker,

300
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,406
worked construction
his whole entire life.

301
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,707
My grandfather passed away
in the kitchen,

302
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:14,512
and my grandmother passed away
in what is now our bedroom.

303
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,916
JOE: When Amy spoke to us about
Grandpa still being around,

304
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,416
it was beyond comforting.

305
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,454
It was like I always knew
that they were here,

306
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,457
but to hear it from somebody
that can actually see

307
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,791
is, you know --
it's reassuring for sure.

308
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,229
This is his grandpa,
and that's him as a baby.

309
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,196
AMY: Oh, okay.

310
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,969
I did do a sketch
of the person I met.

311
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,671
Oh, geez.

312
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,876
That's your grandfather.
Trust me.

313
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,079
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,582
I miss him.

315
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:55,437
He watches the kids.

316
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,222
I'm just glad to know

317
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,924
that he too watches over
the little ones

318
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,095
'cause that's how he was with me
when I was a little guy.

319
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,266
STEVE:
What else did you see?

320
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,771
I saw this thing, like,
trying to get into the house.

321
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,937
It was odd.

322
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,439
It was very, very tall.

323
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,910
It was kind of hunched
by its neck.

324
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:20,613
It did not look human.

325
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,281
I did do a sketch.

326
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,520
Oh, I'm getting so ****
out of here.

327
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,302
JOE: When Steve
pulled the sketch out,

328
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,235
I didn't even want
to look at it.

329
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,473
It was not something
that you normally see,

330
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,106
nor anything that I imagined

331
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,176
she would ever find
here on my land.

332
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,879
I think that these things
harmed children in the past --

333
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,946
like, way back when.

334
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:00,468
I was being told
that, in fact,

335
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:03,955
it was some type
of alien creature.

336
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,956
****

337
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,058
I know it's a lot,

338
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,061
and they're trying
through subtle ways

339
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:16,268
to have the living people
get out of the area.

340
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,974
Since Native Americans
are guarding your land,

341
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,743
I suggest
you contact a local shaman

342
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,477
who can help you
remove the dead

343
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,447
that have been attracted
to your property.

344
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,949
In the meantime,
this is black salt.

345
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,750
Take just a little bit
of this

346
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:37,555
and put it at the entrance
of each bedroom door.

347
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,289
STEVE:
So, Joe, I got to ask.

348
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,527
Are you gonna take Amy's advice
and do what she says?

349
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:03,280
JOE:
Since the investigation,

350
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,418
the paranormal activity
has stayed the same.

351
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,651
I'm fed up with it.

352
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:10,189
I'm just ready
for things to be taken care of.

353
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,230
WOMAN: Balance, peace,
harmony, love, and joy

354
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,765
be restored
to the home of Joe and Sue.

355
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,803
Sue and I definitely took
Amy's advice seriously,

356
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,471
and we contacted a local shaman

357
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,275
to come in and clear the dead
from the property.

358
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,161
I know you've been
through a lot.

359
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,977
You've been
through Hell and back,

360
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,746
but everything
that you're dealing with

361
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,514
can be resolved and healed.

362
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,785
JOE: To see somebody
with that kind of confidence

363
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,022
and with that kind of attitude
was very reassuring.

364
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:49,695
All my honorable ancestors
and spirit guides

365
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,927
are with me now.

366
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,296
I call into this space

367
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,698
the healing power
of God's white light.

368
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,500
JOE: Her plan of action
was to go outside

369
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,555
and start a bonfire
and do a blessing outside.

370
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,667
I call upon you great spirit,
great mystery,

371
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,709
and all the beautiful beings,
seen and unseen,

372
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:10,749
to assist us to heal this land,
to heal this house,

373
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,534
and to heal this family.

374
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,250
JOE: Her explanation was

375
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:16,922
that the bonfire's
gonna open up a portal

376
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,555
to let the dead pass through

377
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,894
and give an offering
to the Indian spirits

378
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,460
that occupy the land here.

379
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:28,132
If you could please make
an offering to the fire.

380
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,237
When you create a sacred fire,
it makes a vortex

381
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,623
and the spirits
are attracted to it.

382
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,975
And so, their souls,
their spirits

383
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,475
can transition and go on

384
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,113
and find peace and joy
and happiness.

385
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:47,550
Thank you to all the beings,
seen and unseen,

386
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:51,223
that have joined us here today
to help heal this family.

387
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,763
JOE: Then, her next plan
was to do a blessing inside.

388
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,601
I'm gonna begin
the cleansing of the house now

389
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:06,405
by opening sacred space
and calling in spirit

390
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,372
with my drum and my rattle.

391
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,959
STEVE: The shaman used
the rattle and her drum

392
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,477
to break up the residual energy
that was here

393
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:18,149
as a part of getting the dead
to pass on to the other side.

394
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,698
After the shaman
did her cleansing

395
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:39,137
of the house and the property,
it's definitely a relief

396
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,572
and just a sense
of peacefulness in the air

397
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,192
instead of how it used to be.

398
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,776
To have our house cleansed

399
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:50,381
makes me look forward
to happy times with the family

400
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,585
and sharing and spending
time together once again.

[ Laughter ]

402
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,726
AMY: It's a good thing
the Native Americans,

403
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,429
along with Joe's grandfather
were watching over the family,

404
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,047
or things could have been
a lot worse.

405
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,631
And I'm pleased
they followed through

406
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,533
and blessed their house
and land.

407
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,003
But, unfortunately,
since there's nothing

408
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,803
they can do
to remove the aliens,

409
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:16,674
Joe and Sue will have
to closely monitor the activity

410
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,077
for as long
as they stay in their home.

411
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,692
STEVE:
When I was on the NYPD,

412
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,896
there was nothing worse
than a mom telling me

413
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,066
she feels helpless
in protecting her kids.

414
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,765
So when a terrified mom
in St. Louis

415
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,002
called fearing
for her children's safety,

416
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,236
I knew we had to find out

417
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,806
what that hell was going on
and fast.

418
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,341
Three years ago,
me and my children

419
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:54,110
moved in the home
with my sister,

420
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,147
and little things
just started happening --

421
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,915
noises, footsteps.

422
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,720
And then everything
just started to get physical.

423
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,555
Okay, what happened?

424
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,927
Haley, my 10-year-old,
was hit with an object.

425
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,460
SHANNON: Being a parent,

426
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,231
you always want to protect
your children no matter what,

427
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,498
but under the circumstance,

428
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,035
I really did not know
what to do.

429
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,039
There was
so many crazy things going on,

430
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,341
I just had to call
Steve and Amy.

431
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,144
This a picture of them?
Yes.

432
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,410
And that's her?
Yes.

433
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:30,214
This brush
came from nowhere

434
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,984
and just hit her
in the back.

435
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,418
It terrified me

436
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,354
because something's trying
to harm my child.

437
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,987
That was the last straw.

438
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,156
That's why
I called you guys.

00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:44,029
Since we have moved out,
my sister is in more danger.

440
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,463
It's gotten worse.

441
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,299
Okay.

AMY: This was an extremely
complicated and dangerous case,

Someone here,

00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:14,357
and I think
it's this tall, scary man.

446
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,762
Right away, I saw what
this aggressive entity

447
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,262
was capable of.

He's able
to manipulate the living body.

Like, he can cause physical pain
in the body.

that whoever lived here

451
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,743

526
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:07,524
his intentions
were not as bad as I thought.

527
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,495
He's able to interact
like a living person.

528
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,582
He's, you know, kind of, like,
torturing people

529
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:17,635
to get them out of here
because of these kids.

530
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,504
So, he thinks
he's helping the living

531
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,003
to get them
to leave here

532
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,740
before something happens
to them?

533
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,442
Yes, he does.

534
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,445
He does believe that.

535
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,015
STEVE: I knew what I was about
to ask Crystal next

536
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,316
might be tough on her,
but it had to be asked,

537
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:37,422
both for her sake and the sake
of our investigation.

538
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:39,924
We haven't talked about
why I'm really here --

539
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,591
the staircase.

540
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,158
Yeah.

541
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:45,129
Take me through
what happened.

542
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,231
So, basically I just walked
up the steps,

543
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:53,669
and then all of a sudden...
I fell down the stairs.

544
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:58,909
And then I fractured my elbow
at the bottom of the stairs.

545
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,145
How do you think
you fell?

546
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,346
I think
that I was pushed.

547
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:07,717
At the time it happened,
I felt hands on my shoulders,

548
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,188
and I have no explanation for it
because no one else was here.

549
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:13,791
I'm really concerned
for you.

550
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,024
You were almost killed.

551
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,725
That would have killed
most people.

552
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,497
Yeah, one of the kids
probably wouldn't have made it.

553
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,038
AMY:
These little kids that are here,

554
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:31,326
I think that they...

555
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:35,580
are really damaged now.

556
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,652
MATT:
What do these kids do?

557
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:49,726
They cause really very, very,
violent, bad things to happen.

558
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,879
I don't like this.

559
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:53,623
I don't like this.

560
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:55,332
NARRATOR: Next...

561
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,300
They were buried
on the property.

562
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:01,339
...the hunt for answers
puts Amy in danger.

563
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:03,639
'Cause he's doing
some pretty bad ****

564
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:07,479
I don't really want
to be down here anymore.

565
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,943
STEVE: I had spent
enough time with Crystal

566
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:25,295
to know that underneath
that brave face,

567
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,863
she was scared and scared bad.

568
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,734
And she needed two things if she
was gonna save her home --

569
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,401
hope and answers.

570
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,938
I managed to trace the land
her house was built on

571
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,404
back to its first owner,

572
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,276
which then led me straight
to one of his descendants.

573
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:46,918
MARCIA: Basil William Alexander
was my third great-grandfather.

574
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,085
What can you tell me
about him?

575
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,554
He was a self-made man --
made a lot of money.

576
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,192
This is a picture of him
when he was in his heyday --

577
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,459
quite a prominent man.

578
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,726
He's a big guy.

579
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,898
Even though this looks like
he's a healthy, well-fed man,

580
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,069
death records show
when he finally died at age 79,

581
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:07,205
he actually died of marasmus,
which is malnutrition.

582
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,242
He wasted away
to nothing.

583
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:21,819
AMY: This tall, scary man,
he's very thin.

584
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,552
He's very lanky.

585
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,555
I think he, you know,
kind of did

586
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,160
maybe shady things, you know,
to make money, you know?

587
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:34,097
This is going pretty back.

588
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,701
You know, like, 1860s.

589
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:39,235
Sometimes in death,

590
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,270
people's personalities
will fracture,

591
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,808
and they'll appear to me
like different dead people,

592
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,241
but they're not.

593
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,446
They're simply different aspects
of the dead person.

594
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:52,015
When I started to get in there
to see things,

595
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:57,154
he got really sad and was, like,
kind of, like, vulnerable.

596
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,358
He didn't like that,
but now he's very angry.

597
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,661
1860 is what we show.

598
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,261
He bought 80 acres.

599
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,831
We have a map here
that shows his land.

600
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,064
He had a home there.

601
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,967
He had a rock quarry,
a vineyard.

602
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,468
He had slave quarters.

603
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,439
Now, do you know
how many slaves he did have?

604
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,808
Family records show
that during the Civil War,

605
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,277
he had up to 23 slaves.

606
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,676
That was families --

607
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,814
you know, men, women,
and, of course, their children.

608
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,114
And, you know, if they died,

609
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,751
they were buried
on the property.

610
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,889
AMY:
The tall, scary man,

611
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,042
he definitely has
a lot of control

612
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:37,159
over the other dead people here.

613
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:41,232
There's something about...
bad kids --

614
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,566
well, bad children.

615
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,403
And then I'm hearing
"head master."

616
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,256
You know, that they're,
like, **** demons

617
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,742
and, you know,
they don't have souls anyways.

618
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,543
I don't know
what's going on here.

619
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,613
This time,
I'm getting weird, man.

620
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,683
I want to say
that he lost a child.

621
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,417
I think he lost a son.

622
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,486
STEVE:
Turns out Basil's slaves

623
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:07,024
weren't the only ones
buried on his property.

624
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,527
Out of the 13 children
that were born to him,

625
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,663
only six of them
lived to adulthood.

626
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,236
He believes in Heaven
and Hell and God,

627
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:23,140
but he denounces them.

628
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,008
I finally understood.

629
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,379
This man was broken,
without faith,

630
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,380
and had nothing left to lose.

631
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:34,450
'Cause he's doing
some pretty bad ****

632
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,054
I don't really want
to be down here anymore.

633
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,422
NARRATOR: Next...

634
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:44,528
These childlike entities
orchestrate catastrophes.

635
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,830
NARRATOR:
...the shocking reveal.

636
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:47,062
Oh, ****

637
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:48,764
Are you kidding me
right now?

638
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,636
NARRATOR: Clients face
the terrifying truth.

639
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,437
It was shocking.
It scared me.

640
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:57,842
NARRATOR: And the living
determine the fate of the dead.

641
00:32:57,877 --> 00:33:01,646
Give us the strength
to destroy all of the evil!

642
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:25,101
STEVE: Amy, I'd like you
to meet Shannon and Crystal.

643
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,704
Now, they're sisters.

644
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,640
Crystal actually owns this home,

645
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,094
and Shannon was living here
with her four kids.

646
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,479
Activity got so bad here
a few months back,

647
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:40,449
she packed up herself
and the four kids and got out.

648
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,254
Crystal is still in the house,
but she's here alone.

649
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,487
I knew Amy
was gonna find something.

650
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,692
I mean, it wasn't a question
of whether or not she would,

651
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,095
it was just<i>
what</i> she was gonna find.

652
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,762
AMY: I met
an elderly gentleman.

653
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:58,469
He's very capable of interaction
on a physical level.

654
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:02,238
People
definitely see this guy.

655
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,960
I saw this person
push himself out of his skin,

656
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:10,840
and then he was just, like,
a skeleton with muscle.

657
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,685
This man can cause the living
to have hallucinations.

658
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,823
These girls talk about
hallucinations for both of them.

659
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,725
Mm-hmm.

660
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:28,499
These three images just came
to me one after another.

661
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,767
When Amy explained the entity,

662
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:34,905
it really just took the breath
out of me.

663
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,338
It terrified me so bad.

664
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:41,410
People were very afraid of him,
and after quite some time,

665
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:44,982
I got that he did lose a child,
and that it was a son.

666
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:46,481
Now, back in 1860,

667
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,186
this property was acquired
by a guy, B.W. Alexander.

668
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:52,756
1861,
he moved his entire family here

669
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,042
along with his 23 slaves.

670
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:57,259
Now, you said this guy

671
00:34:57,294 --> 00:35:00,096
was tough, smart,
and intimidated people.

672
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,899
Well, Alexander was
a pretty powerful man

673
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,233
in this neighborhood

674
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,701
and became
a self-made millionaire.

675
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,471
Now, this guy had 13 children
altogether.

676
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,008
Six of them died.

677
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,210
Four of them were boys.

678
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,814
You said he was skinny?
Mm-hmm.

679
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,383
He died of malnutrition.

680
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,317
Oh.

681
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:29,527
The other thing I got
was these childlike entities.

682
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:35,631
They like to orchestrate,
like, catastrophes.

683
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:40,238
I actually believe whatever
is in my house wants to hurt me,

684
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:44,092
so when Amy mentioned
the childlike demons

685
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,911
causing chaos in my home,
it was shocking.

686
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:52,348
To have it validated was scary.

687
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:57,254
I was seeing
a lot of different scenarios

688
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,656
that these kids
were planning,

689
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:05,562
and one of things was something
that I sketched.

690
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,497
STEVE: Okay.

691
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,569
Oh!

692
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,525
Are you kidding me
right now?

693
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,144
This is what
I was afraid of.

694
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,581
CRYSTAL:
When Amy showed me this sketch,

695
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:30,087
I literally just could not
control my emotions anymore.

696
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:33,188
It's an unbelievable feeling
to see

697
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:36,192
that someone else sees
what happened to you,

698
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,995
and they weren't even there.

699
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,998
It's amazing.

700
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,700
Stop it.

701
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:48,205
I was standing on the landing
at the top of the stairs,

702
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,342
and then I felt a push.

703
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,379
I tumbled, like, completely,
and I fractured my elbow.

704
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,053
Well, Shannon,
the big question is,

705
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,156
can she stay here safely?

706
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,378
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

707
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:14,597
So, you need to bring in
a chaos magician.

708
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,367
AMY: Chaos magicians
are very powerful and effective,

709
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,072
but I only recommend using them
in the most extreme cases.

710
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,307
So, everything would be
cleared out then?

711
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,274
Yes.

712
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,810
Including the kids?
Yeah.

713
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,346
But I do have a concern

714
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,017
for you being here
in the meantime

715
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:37,119
because
they're going to feel

716
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:41,825
extremely threatened
and very unhappy.

717
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,425
Basically, you're telling her

718
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,329
she should
go stay someplace else

719
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,231
until she gets this guy in.

720
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,064
I think you should.
Yes.

721
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,770
Would you be able
to swing that?

722
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,761
Since the investigation,
the activity has not let up.

723
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,494
Most nights,

724
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,830
I stay with my best friend
or my boyfriend.

725
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:25,435
And I come home to get clothes,
and I leave back out again.

726
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,741
I left my home
for a couple of days,

727
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,210
and I came back
to check things out.

728
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,810
I saw some weird things.

729
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,647
I came home one day
to find this empty space here.

730
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,049
See, it looks like
there's shoes missing.

731
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,584
See how they're all lined up?

732
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:46,755
Came back a couple says later
only to find this.

733
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,827
It looks like kind of a pyramid,
triangle sort of thing.

734
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,964
Why would someone do this?

735
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,598
It scared me,

736
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:59,035
and it was hard
for me to explain it away.

737
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:04,307
MAN: I feel bad
that so many atrocities

738
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,275
have happened around here.

739
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,945
But these people,
they are innocent.

740
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,652
So, I followed Amy's advice,
and I found a chaos magician.

741
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,720
I can feel the pain.

742
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:24,561
You know that you are done,
and it is time to go.

743
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,164
CRYSTAL:
I hope that the chaos magician

744
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,998
can take all these entities,

745
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,101
round them up,
and head them out.

746
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,701
I love my home,

747
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:36,440
but if this does not work,
I'm moving.

748
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,375
MAN:
Cross them through!

749
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,013
Let them cross
through water and altar.

750
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,780
Drag all the dead to the altar.

751
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,418
CRYSTAL: The first thing
the chaos magician did

752
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,752
was perform
a voodoo altar ritual.

753
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:54,424
It's to help the entities
cross over and leave my home.

754
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,695
MAN: Look at all we've brought
for you.

755
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,064
The Baron calls you home.

756
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,031
Let go of your pain.

757
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:06,101
Let go of your suffering.

758
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:10,508
CRYSTAL:
And then the chaos magician
told my sister and I

759
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,243
to let go of the anger
and the hostility

760
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,577
we felt towards these spirits

761
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:19,581
because it would help them
to cross over.

762
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,985
There are things here
that are not of the dead,

763
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,052
but forgive them.

764
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,921
Be at peace in your heart.

765
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,458
In your mind, you might
even say, "I forgive you."

766
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,425
Move on.

767
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,464
The next ritual was
the archangel cleansing ritual.

768
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,800
Those seven archangels
of creation,

769
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:43,473
walk with me
to make sure nothing remains.

770
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,609
The purpose
of the angelic ritual

771
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,711
was to remove
the demonic influences

772
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,244
that Amy had picked up,

773
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:52,014
to give them a choice
to leave on their own accord

774
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,820
or to get forced to be expelled
from the property and the area.

775
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,121
Descend into our space.

776
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,057
Descend down into our circle,

777
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,261
oh, Michael great angel,
the son --

778
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,997
he who vanquishes evil.

779
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,684
Surround great Marshall.

780
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,301
Marshall, archangel.

781
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:16,205
Archangel of Mars,
of victory and strength,

782
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,574
grant us that, today,

783
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:23,413
we shall have complete victory
over all the negative spirits.

784
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:28,486
Give us the strength to dispel
and destroy all of the evil!

785
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:43,734
CRYSTAL: When the chaos magician
was calling on the archangels,

786
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:47,270
I can't really explain it,
but it was kind of like

787
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:51,842
I was feeling a light,
so to speak.

788
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,178
My house feels comfortable.

789
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:56,479
I feel like it's my house.

790
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,050
I don't feel the eyes
on me right now.

791
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,651
At this moment,

792
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,922
I feel like the dead
and the entities

793
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,656
are out of my home.

794
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,560
I just hope they stay out,
and I'm gonna do everything

795
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:14,665
that Amy suggested to me
to keep them out.

796
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,035
AMY: I'm really glad

797
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,803
Crystal and Shannon
followed my advice.

798
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,090
Now that a chaos magician
has been in the home,

799
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,343
they should be able
to live in peace and quiet

800
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,346
for a long time to come.
