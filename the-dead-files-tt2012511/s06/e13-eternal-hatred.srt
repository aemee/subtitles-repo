1
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:14,220
It hurts to be in here.

2
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:18,291
I don't know how to protect my family.

3
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,286
If you go in that barn,
you're gonna die.

4
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,929
I hate this house.

5
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,442
I love my house, but I love my family more.

6
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:27,862
Ow!!

7
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:29,068
This is worse than a prison.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,288
That's very, very, very bad

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,696
and there's blood.

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:36,388
I think that the living
are caught in a war zone.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,410
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:42,627
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,735
What's happening?

14
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:45,841
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:48,290
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:50,778
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,948
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,117
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,290
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:58,279
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:00,295
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:01,906
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,177
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,185
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,295
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:10,497
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,698
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,168
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,449
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,195
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:19,235
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:20,439
...until the very end.

33
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,215
You got problems. I got news for you.

34
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:24,428
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,508
This is<i> our</i> house,
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,279
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,487
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,464
I'm in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania.

39
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:50,638
It's an upscale community about
40 minutes outside of Philly.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,316
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Carol.

41
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,189
Now she told me the activity
in her dream home is so bad

42
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:59,660
it's ruining her health and
tearing her family apart.

43
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,499
She got real emotional on the phone

44
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,870
and begged us to come out.

45
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,806
She says we're her last hope.

46
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:10,282
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:14,420
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

48
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:17,359
This house has a lot of family photos.

49
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:19,262
Once they're covered or removed,

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,932
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,888
I think I'm feeling, like, sick.

52
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,260
I have a fever.

53
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,102
Hot and cold at the same time

54
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,538
and heart's pounding.

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,739
I'm also getting this woman.

56
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,243
I think she causes...

57
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,146
sickness and, um,

58
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:52,647
extreme nausea.

59
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,453
But she always is moving
all over the [bleep] place.

60
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,160
She literally looks like a [bleep] blur.

61
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:01,031
And she likes to move things around.

62
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,304
Redecorating is what she thinks she's doing.

63
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,708
And she's very strange-looking.

64
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,849
She has spider arms and spider legs,

65
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,589
and then her head is more... just,
like, a skull.

66
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,725
She's scary and she scares people.

67
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,640
Uh, so, Carol, I'm glad I'm here.

68
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:28,611
You sounded really upset on the phone

69
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:30,380
and it sounds like you're
going through a tough time.

70
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:33,350
Yeah, I called you in
'cause I really need help.

71
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:36,723
I'm concerned for our physical safety,

72
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,294
emotional safety,

73
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:41,064
and I don't know how to protect my family.

74
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,666
Now how long have you lived here?

75
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,335
12 years.

76
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,938
Now who lives in the house with you now?

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,742
My husband and my son.

78
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:52,847
My daughter, who's in college,
used to, uh, be here.

79
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,551
And the older daughter
lives about 20 minutes away

80
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:56,887
with her daughter.

81
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,923
Now tell me what's going on in the house.

82
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:02,695
Noises, things being moved around,

83
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,568
seeing shadows,

84
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,471
and I definitely think
it impacts how you feel.

85
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:13,307
Within the first year of living here,

86
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,541
I ended up getting sick...

87
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,176
uh, fibromyalgia,

88
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,947
chronic fatigue, migraines.

89
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,283
You seem to think it has
to do with the house.

90
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,917
I think it can all be tied in.

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,721
Doctors, when they would test,
would say I look great on paper.

92
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,989
Okay, 'cause to look at you,
you look healthy.

93
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:31,190
Why don't you just move?

94
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:34,026
It's our home, and I don't wanna leave.

95
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:38,629
But I'm very fearful for my family,
for my kids,

96
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,064
and my grandchild.

97
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:48,100
The living, yeah, they totally see her,

98
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:50,099
the woman from outside.

99
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,401
I think they see her, like...

100
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:53,237
- like if the light was shining on her...
- Right.

101
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,806
and then there's a shadow.

102
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,971
Oh, she's goes [bleep] nuts in here, man.

103
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:02,574
She really makes you not feel good,

104
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,576
and the thing heart and the...fever.

105
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:08,981
You know, she just does... it's terrible.

106
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,350
She has too much energy.

107
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,952
What does that do to the living?

108
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,283
Probably give you a heart attack. Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,951
Okay, Carol,
so why are we up in this part of the house?

110
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:24,886
Upstairs here is when I
first came face-to-face

111
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,887
with a black mass.

112
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,655
Came up to about my waist level.

113
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,992
I came up on it from behind,

114
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:35,529
and the top of it turned
around and looked at me.

115
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:37,998
Okay, have... have you seen it again?

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,701
I've seen a shadow figure.

117
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:43,205
I think it's the same thing.
It's just in a different form.

118
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:47,811
More like a male adult, around 6-feet-9.

119
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,413
Now is anything else going on?

120
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,746
One of the things is that

121
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,747
the door will just close on its own.

122
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,815
You're talking about these doors right here?

123
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,050
Just...

124
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,852
- outta nowhere?
- Yes.

125
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:00,388
Do you hear it?

126
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,228
No. You don't hear it closing,
you don't hear it latching shut,

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,561
but it's closed.

128
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:07,830
Okay. Now what about it being on a tilt?

129
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:09,732
This is not off-kilter or anything?

130
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,706
No. It has a latch handle,
so you think you would hear it.

131
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,379
Like that. You'd hear that.
You would hear that.

132
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,713
I can't explain it.

133
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:20,914
Well, that's gotta scare the hell outta ya,

134
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,382
you turn around and see the door closed.

135
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,250
Yeah, I don't sleep very well.

136
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,195
There's somebody else in the house, uh,

137
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:35,533
that the woman from outside doesn't like.

138
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:38,399
Uh, and I think he kinda
torments her a little bit.

139
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,401
He is...

140
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,739
always looking for her

141
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,542
and won't let her alone.

142
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:50,921
She says that dude is up the stairs.

143
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,355
He's like a bull in a china shop.

144
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:58,795
He's not aware of, you know, his strength.

145
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:03,200
He's like, you think about a door,
and a door slams...

146
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,703
and then all the [bleep] doors slam.

147
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,003
But it's not like he meant to.

148
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,504
Do you know how he might
appear to the living?

149
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:13,808
I think they see him a
like a big black mist.

150
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,079
They might see him, like,
hovering over them,

151
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,315
like, lurking in the corner.

152
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,349
He's like,
"I'm trying to take care of that [bleep].

153
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,486
I'm trying to [bleep] control her ass."

154
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,891
Uh, he says that she
causes all the problems.

155
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,125
All the problems. Not him. It's her.

156
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,466
Sure as [bleep] wants to break things.

157
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,301
She doesn't wanna [bleep] be here anymore.

158
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:40,971
She's tired of the [bleep]
crazy-ass guy who's here,

159
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:42,439
[bleep] tortures her.

160
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,172
Uh, so she gets out occasionally.

161
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,542
Uh, but then, you know,
she ends up back here,

162
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:50,013
and then there he is, and she's upset.

163
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,687
Okay.

164
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,289
You had an experience here?

165
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,826
Yeah.
At one point, I did have horses. Okay.

166
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:09,432
So to help with, uh,
mice that come in with the food grain,

167
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,466
I had purchased some cats.

168
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:12,800
And to keep the wildlife out,

169
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,803
we would put cat food in a container.

170
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,305
And to make sure they
couldn't get into that,

171
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:19,007
we put a cinder block on top.
Okay, what happened?

172
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,276
One time, my son came out to feed the cats.

173
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,578
One of our cats was dead within the bin.

174
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,413
<i> Inside</i> the bin?

175
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:27,484
And the cinder block was on top.

176
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:28,885
Okay.
He must've been shocked when he saw that.

177
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,387
Yeah. Me, too.

178
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,021
It just floored me.

179
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:34,489
Is there any chance the cat
jumped in before he closed it

180
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,757
and didn't see the cat and
maybe suffocated this thing?

181
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,492
It's not a real deep food bin.

182
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,694
All right, so he would've seen the cat.
He would've seen it.

183
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,027
Well, I got news for you.

184
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,864
- If that's supernatural, you got a problem.
- Yeah.

185
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,034
I know you got issues here,
but what are you...

186
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,202
what are you trying to get out

187
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:48,571
of the investigation we're gonna do?

188
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,271
I need to find out what's going on here

189
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,907
for the safety of my family.

190
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,743
I think whatever this entity is,

191
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:58,513
it can impact people's personalities,

192
00:08:58,515 --> 00:09:01,214
like the behavior of Kelly in the past.

193
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,416
- Kelly's your daughter?
- Kelly's my daughter.

194
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,453
What are we talking about?
What kind of behavior?

195
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:09,556
When we moved in here,
she became just atrocious...

196
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,592
the things that she would say

197
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,896
and her physical violence against me.

198
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:16,164
It was almost as if

199
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,967
it wasn't even my daughter
saying the things she was

200
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,137
and doing the things she was.

201
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,305
But why do you think that's paranormal

202
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:23,238
and not just teenage nonsense?

203
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,675
Well, because when she then
moved out of the house...

204
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:29,513
we actually asked her to
leave because her personality,

205
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,983
the way she was acting
jeopardized my marriage,

206
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:36,017
jeopardized the rest of
the children in the house.

207
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,184
Okay.

208
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,418
And when we asked her to leave,

209
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,119
then she's done a complete turnaround.

210
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,387
Really?

211
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,388
No more explosive outbursts.

212
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,255
It's completely different.

213
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,265
I'm feeling that same woman.

214
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:59,166
Something, uh, she, uh...

215
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:00,499
She has been saying,

216
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,366
"Oh,
don't go in there 'cause you'll all die!

217
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,068
You'll all die!"

218
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,006
She's saying there's
something in here that's, uh,

219
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,172
not good.

220
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,505
It's done harm.

221
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:15,647
She thinks that no one
can take care of this.

222
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,582
That's very, very, very bad.

223
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,486
It's been here a long time.

224
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,987
This thing is, uh...

225
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,222
a blob.

226
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,158
It came...

227
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,393
like a snake

228
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,325
that, uh...

229
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:33,360
may be influencing people.

230
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,431
Because it talks to them?

231
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,370
It's made a lot of people...

232
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,504
angry.

233
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,807
It can make you do bad things.

234
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,843
But it does... it causes damage.

235
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,108
A lot of damage.

236
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,005
I don't like it in here.

237
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,775
It hurts to be in here.

238
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,904
So, Rob, I was talking to your wife,

239
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,442
and, uh, it was upsetting listening to her.

240
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,444
So, uh, how you taking all this?

241
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,843
It's been very stressful.

242
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,413
I'm an engineer, so, you know,
I believe in science

243
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,915
and I look for facts and I look for proof.

244
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,719
Things just kept happening
and happening that

245
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,489
I really couldn't explain.

246
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,827
It's very disconcerting,
and especially because of

247
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:34,793
all the different kinds of
things that have happened.

248
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,094
Have you had any experiences
while you've been here?

249
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,031
I've heard footsteps.

250
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,067
Laying in bed,
I've heard things outside in the hallway.

251
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,202
Now the footsteps... you sure it wasn't

252
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,872
- one of the kids walking around?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,041
Positive?

254
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,611
Yeah. Sure. Positive. Absolutely.

255
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:49,215
Okay, so now anything else happen to you?

256
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:52,715
I had an episode where I
woke up in the morning,

257
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,953
took a shower, and my back burned.

258
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:59,526
And I felt to the back,
and I had scratches on my back.

259
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:03,396
And my wife said,
"You have big gouges on your back."

260
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,500
And she actually ended up
taking a picture of 'em.

261
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:09,236
This is your back? That's my back.

262
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,204
Show me where these scratches would've been

263
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:14,072
and how you could've did it.

264
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:16,975
It would've been...

265
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,343
like...right here.

266
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,379
I- I mean... And I would've had to,
essentially,

267
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,847
- just do like that.
- Oh, I see where it was.

268
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:26,350
It was, like,
right into the meaty part of my back.

269
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:27,751
It is possible? Yeah.

270
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:30,220
But it's kinda pushing it
that you did it yourself.

271
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,855
I mean,
it's almost like you were in a straitjacket.

272
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:34,724
What do<i> you</i> think is going on in this house?

273
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:37,058
There's some sort of...

274
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,729
uh... haunting.

275
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,897
You know, I love my house,
but I love my family more.

276
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,766
And I'll... if I... if I need to move,
I'll move.

277
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,238
She's pissed. Oh, she's pissed.

278
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,577
He keeps saying he doesn't
mean to hurt anybody.

279
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:00,079
I think he, like, cuts people.

280
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,148
That's what sh... wait.

281
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,184
I think that's what <i>she's</i> saying.

282
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,123
So who the [bleep] knows who's cuttin' who?

283
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,726
I'm caught in the middle of a war

284
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,759
between the dead man and woman.

285
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,993
Both are telling me
completely different stories,

286
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,260
and it's impossible to know
who's telling the truth.

287
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:22,595
He's like,<i> "I'm</i> the one trying to protect."

288
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:25,200
He tries to stop her from
doing her crazy [bleep].

289
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:28,342
He's more... worried about her,

290
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:33,917
because she physically effects the living.

291
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:41,223
That's what he's trying to stop.

292
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:45,093
He feels like the problems he causes

293
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,731
are far less than if he was not here

294
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,568
and she was running amok.

295
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,567
So, Kelly,
I'm glad I got a chance to speak to you.

296
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,068
I was talking to mom,

297
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,670
and she told me you were having a...

298
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,438
kind of a tough time in this house.

299
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,376
I hate this house. Hate it.
It's just negative.

300
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,606
But she thought that

301
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:14,342
whatever's in this house
definitely influenced you.

302
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:16,546
I think it had an influence.

303
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,781
We were always just at each others' necks.

304
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,685
Even the little mistakes would
turn into a total blowup.

305
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,353
- You got violent.
- Yeah. It was bad.

306
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,222
Sometimes you just get so mad and,
like, black out

307
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:28,994
and not really be able
to put 2 and 2 together

308
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:31,365
about what just happened.

309
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,633
Let me just ask you.
Do you think it was the house

310
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,735
and what's in this house that did it to you?

311
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:35,971
Or do you think it was just

312
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,273
you were being a pain in the ass teenager?

313
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:40,441
Um, 100% believe with everything in me

314
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,779
that there is something here.

315
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:49,119
She's telling me everything that she does,
uh, to people.

316
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:53,123
She kind of harassed
someone that lived here.

317
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:58,028
There's a young girl... teenager, I think...

318
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,866
that she didn't have respect for her mom.

319
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,403
She had very bad thoughts

320
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,973
that were not good, pure.

321
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,507
She really, really hated her.

322
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,675
And she...

323
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,712
kind of really let her have it.

324
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,148
What did she do?

325
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,015
She kinda always jumped her <i>a lot.</i>

326
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:21,588
And it would make the kid very sick.

327
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,126
I think she kinda possessed her.

328
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:28,294
Why'd you wanna meet me in this room?

329
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,527
This actually used to be my first room here

330
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,863
when we first moved in,

331
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,004
and this is where I had my
first experience in the house.

332
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,639
Okay, what was that?

333
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,408
Uh, actually, this door right here.

334
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,411
Um, very first night we had moved in,

335
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:45,277
um, just, like, banging and knocking.

336
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,278
Now are we talking about like...

337
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,614
banging like a person was doing it?
As if there was

338
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,284
literally somebody stuck on the other side

339
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,851
trying to get through.

340
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:57,184
So...

341
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,352
Like that.

342
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,521
Exactly like that.

343
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:02,322
I'm 51 years old.

344
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:04,158
That would scare the hell
outta me if I heard that.

345
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,659
Yeah.

346
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,696
I don't have an explanation for it.

347
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,432
Anything else?

348
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,902
Most recently, my daughter actually was,

349
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,639
like, pushed down the stairs.

350
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,510
Legs went over her head,

351
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,281
and she landed on her head.

352
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:24,918
I... of course, like, complete shock.
Freaked out.

353
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,223
I was bawling my eyes out.

354
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,627
I wouldn't want her to
experience the things I have.

355
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,828
I worry about that every day.

356
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:40,266
He's not really aware of the space,
you know, around him.

357
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,372
Indirectly, I think he could hurt people,

358
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:46,207
like by trying to move them out of the way.

359
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,547
I think that the living are...

360
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,381
kinda caught in a war zone.

361
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,390
Some cases I've gotta do a lot of digging

362
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:11,359
before I find a death on the property.

363
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,129
Not this one. Took one phone call.

364
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm on my way to meet
with a sheriff who said

365
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,507
there was a murder right inside
of Rob and Carol's house.

366
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,814
Turns out there was a homicide
in the house I'm investigating.

367
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,383
Yes. Andrew Fedyck was killed in the house

368
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:32,183
in January of 1939.

369
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,653
So now what do we know about
this guy Andrew himself?

370
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:38,086
Andrew and his Bessie
were Austrian immigrants.

371
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:41,257
They moved into the house in 1929.

372
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:45,493
They were the parents of
five girls and one boy.

373
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:46,960
Andrew was a farmer,

374
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,228
and he was known to have a drinking problem.

375
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,796
The night of the homicide,

376
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,066
Andrew came in, and allegedly he was drunk

377
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,169
and had been drinking for several days.

378
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,938
And he was very abusive and boisterous and,
uh,

379
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,744
angry with his wife and
whoever else was in the house.

380
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,481
And, uh, the son, Michael, came in.

381
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:06,882
And when Michael came in,

382
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:10,385
it's alleged that his dad
came after him with a knife.

383
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,686
- Okay, so now how old was Michael?
- Michael was 19.

384
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:14,521
Now I do have a picture of Michael.

385
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:19,291
A struggle ensues,
and Michael is able to disarm his dad.

386
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:22,728
But at the time,
then his father turned his rage

387
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,066
toward Bessie, his wife.

388
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:27,769
She picks up a 12 gauge shotgun.

389
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,504
She gives him a warning.

390
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:30,504
In fact, she gives him several warnings

391
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,305
and asked him to back off.

392
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,106
He proceeds to come after her,

393
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:37,610
and she shoots once and
hits him in the chest.

394
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:40,679
I do have a copy of the death certificate

395
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,613
declaring him dead that night,

396
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,617
with information that he
died from a shotgun blast.

397
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,524
Okay. Homicide, murder by gunshot wounds.

398
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,291
I have the newspaper account.
It was headline news.

399
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:55,529
The newspaper report
said an autopsy performed

400
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,835
revealed that 156 pellets
of the shotgun shell

401
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,073
had pierced his chest.

402
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,145
So, sheriff, did she get arrested for this?

403
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,183
That night, she's taken into custody

404
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,918
and she's charged with both
homicide and manslaughter.

405
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,290
She's released on bail,
and three months later,

406
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,159
she appears in front of a grand jury.

407
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,895
- Okay.
- She alleges self-defense.

408
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:21,065
The grand jury believes that
and they don't indict her.

409
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:25,670
Did they have a relationship in life?

410
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:30,205
Yes. I'm gonna say she knew
him when she was alive.

411
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,975
I don't know if they were related.

412
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,448
With all this fighting going on,
it's hard to know

413
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,951
how this man and woman
knew each other in life.

414
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:39,486
But one thing's for sure...

415
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,921
they can't stand each other in death.

416
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,255
She seems afraid of him some,

417
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,657
thinking that he can do [bleep] to her.

418
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,562
Or has done [bleep] to her, you know.

419
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,264
I don't know if he, like,
beats her up or what,

420
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,399
but she tries to get the
[bleep] out of the way.

421
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,502
I am seeing a... it's a funeral.

422
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:04,176
A wife shoots and kills her husband,

423
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,479
and a grand jury does not indict her.

424
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,915
That just seems odd to me,
especially because it's 1939.

425
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,917
I'm heading over to meet
with a professor in Philly

426
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,588
who'll look into the case for me.

427
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,602
Well, Dr. Ruchti, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate it.

428
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:24,871
My pleasure.

429
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:27,574
All right,
so the reason I asked you to help me out

430
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:28,741
was that I found it odd,

431
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:29,741
especially as a homicide investigator,

432
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:32,045
that this woman did not get indicted

433
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,314
for murder charges.

434
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,249
Steve, it is a really interesting case

435
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:38,118
for the time period, given the fact that

436
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,221
the status of women was subordinate to men

437
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,821
during that time.

438
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:44,488
And... and that's why I thought it odd

439
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,922
that she didn't get indicted... Right.

440
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,657
'cause I figured, it's 1939.

441
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,396
There was no domestic violence
laws on the books yet.

442
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,732
No, there absolutely was not.

443
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,532
In fact, domestic violence wasn't even

444
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,831
part of our language at that point.

445
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,901
We just called these things "family feuds."

446
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,905
Well, it had to be pretty compelling
'cause I'm assuming

447
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,940
that it had to be an all-male grand jury.

448
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,441
Absolutely.

449
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:07,347
When you think of somebody as unequal to men,
less than men,

450
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,449
you might think of them as childlike,

451
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,118
not making the same decisions
that you would make.

452
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,489
And they're... looking at
her as if she was a kid.

453
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,425
- And how do you indict a kid?
- Right.

454
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:20,129
Maybe this grand jury just thought,
you know,

455
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,032
"Well,
she just didn't know what she was doing.

456
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,933
Maybe she lost her mind."

457
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,332
We still see some of this still today,

458
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:28,905
the argument that women are...
are crazy or irrational.

459
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:30,273
So, I mean, what's your opinion on it?

460
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,608
- What do you think about it?
- I think it's very clear

461
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,380
that she was being abused by
her husband severely over time.

462
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,081
She's trying to protect herself.

463
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,117
She's trying to protect her children.

464
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,219
And did not want to hurt or
harm or even kill anyone,

465
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,225
let alone her husband,
but felt she had no other choice

466
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,928
because he was coming for her.

467
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,296
He's like, "She was really angry."

468
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,965
I think he...

469
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,833
privately disliked her.

470
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,308
He thought she was nuts.

471
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:13,151
Yeah, she's done some bad things.

472
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:15,622
He gets angry at her.

473
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,424
He says that she's crazy.

474
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:32,012
So far,
I've got a family being terrorized

475
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:33,345
by unexplained activity

476
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:36,149
and a property that's been
the site of a homicide.

477
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:38,919
But there's gotta be something
else that can help my case,

478
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,457
so I'm at the local library.

479
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,193
Searching through old records,
I find a scandal

480
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:48,933
involving brutal mistreatment
of kids at an orphanage.

481
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,604
Turns out it's right next to

482
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:53,340
my client's original property lines.

483
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,311
I called the local historian,

484
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:58,982
and she says it was a scene of neglect,
abuse, and death.

485
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:08,258
Well, Dr. Giesberg, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

486
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,125
So the article I came across, uh,

487
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,496
mentioned scandal and abuse in an orphanage

488
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,730
not far from the property I'm investigating.

489
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:16,864
Uh, what can you tell me about the place?

490
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,469
It opened up, um, in 1868 on the property

491
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:22,371
of a former Revolutionary War-era hospital.

492
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:23,637
Oh. Okay.

493
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,476
And here's a photograph
of the school in 1870.

494
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:32,048
The orphanage in Chester
Springs was one of 35

495
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,251
- operating in the state of Pennsylvania.
- Wow.

496
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:38,156
Now the article I saw was
sometime in the 1880s.

497
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:40,224
So when did the scandal actually break?

498
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:41,892
There were a series of articles, actually,

499
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,861
- published in the 1880s...
- Okay.

500
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:46,430
uh, reporting abuse at the schools.

501
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,134
- Okay.
- Here are a couple of examples here.

502
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,373
One of these talking about,
uh, kids getting, um,

503
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,808
you know, water tortured

504
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,576
so they can confess to
pulling a prank at the school.

505
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:01,750
Another one, um, alleging, um, sexual abuse

506
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,919
- at the schools.
- Okay.

507
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,186
This is another article

508
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:06,652
that was published in a national newspaper

509
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,618
that talked about the
kids not being provided

510
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,850
with adequate food or clothing,

511
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:14,624
uh, children being neglected
without medical care

512
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:16,025
and dying in their cells.

513
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:17,924
- This is worse than a prison.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

514
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:19,591
The news stories, um,

515
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,959
reported deaths at many of these
schools in... over the years.

516
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,726
So what happens next?

517
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,329
This becomes a political hot potato.

518
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,429
So all the abuse and all
this is still going on?

519
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,761
- That's right.
- All right, so what happens?

520
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,131
So around 1906, um,

521
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,633
the Chester Springs, uh,
Civil War Orphan Home

522
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:38,801
is finally closed.

523
00:24:38,803 --> 00:24:41,472
Here's our article talking
about its last commencement.

524
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,539
Okay. Did anybody go to prison?

525
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,040
Or was it just basically
"you're out of a job now"?

526
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,074
These guys mostly just lost their jobs.

527
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:48,874
- That's it.
- That's right.

528
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,019
There's, like, some...

529
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:59,986
boys?

530
00:24:59,988 --> 00:25:04,459
These guys are, like, beating up this, uh...

531
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,792
you know, they're kids, though.
They're kids.

532
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:08,394
They're beatin' the [bleep] outta this guy.

533
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:12,598
Beatin' the [bleep] out of him.

534
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,436
This is bad over here.

535
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:20,010
Ow!!

536
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:21,848
Ohh.

537
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,486
Whoa, that hurt.

538
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,088
Somebody lost their hearing.

539
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,520
His whole body's on the ground.

540
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:29,320
I think he's dehydrated.

541
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,988
And there's blood.

542
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,122
He's young. He's young.

543
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,559
He's, like, a kid.

544
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,130
Oh, that [bleep] hurt, man.

545
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,333
I think he's delirious.

546
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,844
During my walk,
I was caught in the middle

547
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,313
of a feud between a dead man and woman.

548
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:58,881
I'm meeting with an artist to describe

549
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:02,018
how their battles affect the living.

550
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,054
Dead lady is kind of on the wall.

551
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:07,420
And she's weird. Very strange-looking.

552
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:11,589
She pretty much has a skull for a face.

553
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,460
And there's a dead man across the room,
screaming at her.

554
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:23,296
The living lady is freaking out.

555
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,166
Amy, is this what you saw?

556
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:31,104
Yes, that's what I saw.

557
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

558
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,414
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

559
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,318
and our clients for the first time.

560
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,987
Well, Amy, you're sitting across from, uh,

561
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,752
what I consider a family in crisis.

562
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,489
Uh, this is Rob, that's his wife Carol,

563
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,558
and this is their daughter Kelly,
their oldest.

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,093
Now Kelly doesn't live here anymore.

565
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:13,198
And these are their other two children.

566
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,102
This is Heather, who's away at college,

567
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:17,938
uh, and this is Kyle, who's...14 now?

568
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,442
- 14.
- Yep.

569
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,512
He still lives here.

570
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,714
You should know that the
activity is so bad here,

571
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:26,018
it's ruining Carol's health,

572
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,454
and it's basically tearing the family apart.

573
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,488
And they told me that
we are their last hope.

574
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,790
So now that Amy knows a
little bit about...

575
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,958
what's going on here,

576
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,995
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

577
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:44,001
When I first got here,
I encountered a female.

578
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:48,771
Her energy is just... off the charts.

579
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:51,707
She's absolutely in constant motion.

580
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:54,243
She looks... strange.

581
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:57,410
Her face was basically just a skull.

582
00:27:57,412 --> 00:28:01,348
Her arms and legs were extraordinarily long

583
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,750
and kind of spiderlike.

584
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:05,085
Definitely one of the...

585
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,253
the major things that I got from her

586
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:09,455
is that she can make the living by sick.

587
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:14,664
She... latched on to me.

588
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:18,764
I was sweating and I felt, like, the fever.

589
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,905
And I felt like I had, you know, a flu.

590
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:26,208
Oh. This is the...
one of the main reasons we're here,

591
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,211
because your health has deteriorated

592
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,913
since she's moved in.

593
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:33,251
Now you look at her,
she... she looks like the epitome of fit.

594
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,453
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,488
And even the doctors, on paper, say you...

596
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,689
there's nothing wrong.

597
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:39,422
I look great on paper.

598
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:42,893
But I just feel pains... migraines,

599
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,062
random pain, sometimes out of the blue.

600
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,230
Interesting.

601
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:49,533
And what about severe anxiety,
hyperactivity,

602
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:52,571
then feeling extremely drained?

603
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,041
- I would say that's...
- Kelly has a lot of anxiety.

604
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,845
that's actually more Kelly.

605
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,680
That sound right, Kel?

606
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:01,985
Yeah.
It's just hard to hear it.

607
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:06,557
The living should not be at all
interacting with this female

608
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,592
because her energy is so severe

609
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:13,030
and there's so much death
entangled in her energy.

610
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:15,966
At one point, I almost had to stop the walk

611
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:19,836
because I felt like I was gonna
have a [bleep] heart attack.

612
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:25,806
Carol gets these intense
chest pains from time to time.

613
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,745
Told Rob about 'em. He took me to the E.R.

614
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:31,180
Well, that's a smart move.

615
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,980
So it<i> is</i> a real threat

616
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:38,685
because she really can induce that.

617
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,151
Wow.

618
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,453
So that is making me very nervous.

619
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:46,424
Now would the living be able to see her?

620
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:51,262
Yes. They would see her
like a brown misty thing.

621
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:54,799
I've seen it as the mist now.

622
00:29:54,801 --> 00:30:00,137
I've seen it as a, like,
2 to 3 foot mass upstairs,

623
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:03,540
and I've seen it as a shadow figure walking.

624
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:04,874
Wow.

625
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,573
The other thing was,
the woman was talking about

626
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:10,208
torturing this... this girl.

627
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,772
Uh, she was saying it was because

628
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:19,043
she was disrespectful and
didn't have any manners,

629
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,508
so she was trying to teach her a lesson.

630
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,279
She kind of looked like you.

631
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:26,747
Yeah.

632
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:28,981
Those words hit it right on the head,
I'd say.

633
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:32,384
Yeah, our relationship deteriorated a lot

634
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:34,051
for several years...

635
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:36,018
- Mm-hmm.
- once we moved in here.

636
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,086
And a lot of times,
Rob would... it made it difficult

637
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,321
because he would ask
perhaps what I perhaps did

638
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:45,690
to set things off with Kelly.

639
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:49,760
Do you feel like she was
being kind of different

640
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:55,502
or overly controlling or
overly aggressive with you?

641
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:58,105
Obviously,
you guys are being influenced like crazy

642
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,672
by her.

643
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:02,875
And it affected your marriage as well, right?
The whole thing?

644
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:08,283
Un, during that time,
it affected the<i> entire</i> family.

645
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,817
It came to the point

646
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,118
where you guys actually asked her to leave.

647
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,389
Or basically told her to leave, right?

648
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:15,725
I didn't<i> want</i> to do it.

649
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:19,927
I- I love my daughter,

650
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:22,164
but it was overwhelming.

651
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,699
Here, baby.

652
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,369
Thank you.

653
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:31,012
Neither of them could figure
out a way to not escalate

654
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,450
from the smallest argument to a big,
gigantic...

655
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,719
nuclear war.

656
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,221
And as the dad,
I was caught in the middle of it.

657
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,125
It's just scary to think that, like...

658
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,796
something you can't explain
or you can't really see,

659
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:47,198
you don't know what it is,
can affect you that way.

660
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,466
Mm-hmm.

661
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,903
So one of the things

662
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:58,574
that this dead woman was indicating to me

663
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:01,044
was that...

664
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:04,648
she's being tortured by
another dead person here.

665
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,885
This deceased male,
she absolutely hates him.

666
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:13,390
I saw him standing at the top of the stairs,

667
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,427
by the master bedroom, just watching me.

668
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,997
I could hear doors slamming.

669
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,663
He does this.

670
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:23,268
That happens a lot.

671
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,305
The other thing... um,
you would also see him

672
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:29,540
as a large, black mist.

673
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:34,581
And she came back and was
saying how she hated him.

674
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,882
She's like, "He scratches people.

675
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,688
He's worse because he scratches people.
He torments me."

676
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,657
He's calling her a liar.
She's calling him a liar.

677
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,396
You know,
I don't know who... who to b... who to believe.

678
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,731
Well, your walk is nailing

679
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,701
about everything that's
going on in this house.

680
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,503
Rob, do me a favor

681
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:54,640
and just tell Amy how you
think you got these marks.

682
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,708
One morning, I came out of the shower

683
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,642
and I turned around, and Carol said,

684
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:03,913
"You've got big scratches on your back.
How did that happen?"

685
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:08,484
Could this thing also bruise?
Like, cause bruises?

686
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,389
Yeah. And the feeling of being shoved,
pushed, pulled,

687
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:13,958
you know...

688
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,061
does that resonate with you?

689
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:19,366
Tell Amy exactly what happened,

690
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:21,569
because the way you described
it to me did not sound normal.

691
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,104
Mnh-mnh.

692
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:25,341
Lila, my daughter,

693
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:28,143
we were going down the stairs
on that side of the house,

694
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:31,182
and it literally looked like someone, like,

695
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:33,187
put both hands, like,
on the back of her shoulders

696
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,286
and shoved her down, and, like...

697
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:39,992
she, like,
flipped and landed on her head on the stairs.

698
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,595
I... completely lost it.

699
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:48,067
That is probably coming from her.

700
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,438
- It explains a lot, actually.
- A lot.

701
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,173
Yeah, a lot.

702
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:56,612
Well, these two dead people
really hate each other.

703
00:33:56,614 --> 00:34:01,084
Unfortunately,
you guys get caught in the middle,

704
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:05,858
and some physical trauma is
caused by them inadvertently.

705
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,760
I had a-a sketch artist draw

706
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,732
kind of an example of a situation,

707
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,305
specifically in the master bedroom.

708
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,489
Oh,..

709
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,057
Holy crap.

710
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,996
It's creepy.

711
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,868
Kinda makes you feel sick.

712
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,106
Now how would they feel

713
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,672
with them two fight...
the two dead fighting...

714
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:41,109
Just like when I'm... like, they would feel,

715
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:43,677
you know, unsettled, uncomfortable, anxious.

716
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,245
It would kinda explain why I don't...

717
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:48,449
I don't feel at rest.

718
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:49,951
I'm never comfortable.

719
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:52,754
I always feel like there's eyes on me.

720
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:53,987
Mm-hmm.

721
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,653
Now did get anything from
when they were alive?

722
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:59,825
They somehow knew each other
when they were both alive.

723
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:05,129
He always... felt that she was a bitch,

724
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,197
that she was very mean to people.

725
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,966
But, you know,
she definitely has a fear of him

726
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:13,801
because he beat her when she was alive.

727
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:16,601
Well, listening to
everything you had to say,

728
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:18,803
I kinda have an idea already
who you're talking about.

729
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,041
In 1929, Andrew and Bessie Fedyck

730
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:25,611
moved into your house with their kids.

731
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:29,381
Andrew was a laborer and rumored
to be a pretty bad drunk.

732
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:31,383
There is evidence that suggests

733
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:33,586
that he may have been
pretty abusive as well.

734
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:36,988
On January 3, 1939,

735
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,927
Andrew came home drunk and
got into an altercation,

736
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,697
and his son came home... Michael.

737
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,798
And the fight he got into
with his son escalated

738
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,037
where Andrew had a knife
and tried to attack his son.

739
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,775
Michael was able to get the knife away,

740
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:56,011
and Andrew turned his rage
towards his wife Bessie.

741
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:59,381
Now she picks up a 12 gauge shotgun

742
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:01,182
and begs him to stop.

743
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,884
He continues coming at her...

744
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:08,059
and she fires one round...
12 gauge shotgun...

745
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:09,493
into his chest.

746
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:11,094
Wow.

747
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:13,395
That happened right here in this house.

748
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:15,163
Wow.

749
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:17,430
I have his death certificate here.

750
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:20,202
Now this homicide was front page news.

751
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:23,602
I actually have an article
about what happened.

752
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,739
Bessie was immediately arrested.

753
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:30,173
She testifies at the grand jury,

754
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:32,141
and they don't indict her.

755
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:33,642
Self-defense?

756
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:34,909
Yeah, basically.

757
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:37,977
You know,
in my experience working domestic violence

758
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:40,313
for over 20 years on the streets,

759
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,915
this is not something that just happened.

760
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,247
This was abuse going on for years.

761
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:47,616
This may sound just ridiculous,

762
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:53,351
but I was actually hoping
that there was something...

763
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:54,518
factual that could explain

764
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,823
a lot of this nutsy stuff that's going on.

765
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:59,993
I'm just shocked,
and that they're still fighting

766
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,161
and it's still happening

767
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:02,662
and they're still influencing people.

768
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:08,805
So anything else?

769
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,172
Just a quick question.

770
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:11,607
I mean, did you spend a
lot of time in the barn

771
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,744
or around the barn when you were younger?

772
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,880
Um, yeah, 'cause we had horses.

773
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:19,216
Okay. I got it.

774
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:22,621
Okay.

775
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,490
There's something else that's
also influencing this area,

776
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,027
and... and that might have something to do

777
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,129
with what happened here.

778
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,563
I was drawn right to the barn,

779
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:35,167
and the dead lady actually wrapped her...

780
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,105
her arms around my waist and pulled me back.

781
00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:41,139
And she's like,
"You<i> don't</i> wanna go in there."

782
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:44,043
And she goes, "You know,
if you go in that barn,

783
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,245
you're gonna die."

784
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,179
I did feel very unnerved.

785
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:50,247
She was telling me that, um,

786
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,184
there was something in the barn, uh,

787
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,487
that has done a great deal of harm,

788
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,753
that it absolutely was not good.

789
00:37:56,755 --> 00:38:00,355
What I saw was like this small black ball.

790
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:03,090
And then I saw it, like,

791
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,592
kind of go into, like, a snake form.

792
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:08,429
It did then take the shape

793
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:12,399
of a very solid kind of shadow person,

794
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,632
but it's not a shadow person.

795
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:17,669
What I would call it is a demon.

796
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,586
It did take the shape

797
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:40,823
of a very solid kind of shadow person,

798
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:42,158
but it's not a shadow person.

799
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,267
What I would call it is a demon.

800
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,573
The thing is, is that by you being, like,

801
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:56,943
so out there all the time,

802
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,978
like, it's something
that could've absolutely

803
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,314
influenced your behavior

804
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:03,451
and could've taken over slightly even.

805
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:08,224
Uh, it is something that could
have influenced these people.

806
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,275
Not feeling good about
what's going on right now.

807
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,376
No.

808
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:23,780
It's like Grand Central Station for evil.

809
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:27,280
Its mission here is to destroy
as many people as possible.

810
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,784
Now do you think the demon in the barn

811
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,186
was attached to Kelly?

812
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:34,721
- Yes, I think it was.
- You do.

813
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,330
Well, Lila spends a lot of time by the barn.

814
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:44,233
Al the time. She loves following the cats.

815
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:45,800
I think I'm in shock.

816
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,974
Well, guys,
your family's been plagued with questions

817
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:53,709
for years now.

818
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:54,744
Why have you been so sick, Carol?

819
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,980
Why did you act out, Kelly?

820
00:39:56,982 --> 00:39:59,517
And, Rob, you know, why you got scratched.

821
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,018
At least you have answers now.

822
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,854
But the big question is, can you stay here

823
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:06,055
in a calm, peaceful environment

824
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:07,390
and live your lives happily

825
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:10,458
and have you granddaughter
come over and be safe?

826
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,760
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to my partner Amy

827
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:14,396
and see if she has a resolution for us.

828
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,936
There are several things that you need to do

829
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:21,504
in order to make this a safer environment.

830
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:28,277
So in order to remove the
demon in the barn area,

831
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:31,986
I would like there to be a
Catholic priest who comes in.

832
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:37,392
He's going to do an exorcism
of the barn and the property.

833
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:42,500
He does need to make a very firm statement

834
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:45,535
that he is<i> not</i> including

835
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:50,041
the removal of any dead people

836
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:51,676
from this location.

837
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:56,949
So my hope is that he actually
gets rid of this thing,

838
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,478
but he may not.

839
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,549
Uh, he may just get rid
of it from your property.

840
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:07,784
The next day, I want there to
be a physical medium that comes

841
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:11,481
to remove the deceased male
and female from the house.

842
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:13,417
It could take several days,

843
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,514
uh, for it to happen

844
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:18,517
just because there's going
to be a lot of arguing

845
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,822
between the medium and probably
both of the dead people.

846
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:25,389
Now with all that said and done,

847
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,325
will she start feeling better and...

848
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,828
Yes. The difference will be insane.

849
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,865
It'll be a huge, <i>huge</i> difference.

850
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:38,671
We're all highly motivated
to move all this on.

851
00:41:38,673 --> 00:41:41,039
It'd be so nice to be able to come home

852
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,042
and feel like it's a home,

853
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,715
because I don't have that feeling.

854
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:49,417
It's nice to have some answers.

855
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:52,553
Kinda gives you some closure
to that chapter of your life.

856
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:55,626
I really hope Carol
and Rob follow my advice

857
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:58,627
and deal with the entities
terrorizing their family.

858
00:41:58,629 --> 00:42:00,629
With the help of a priest and a medium,

859
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:02,032
they should be able to free themselves

860
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:04,703
of the darkness surrounding their home.
