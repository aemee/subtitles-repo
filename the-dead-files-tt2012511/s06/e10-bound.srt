1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,489
"This is the room, the room of death."

2
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,559
I can't have that in my home.
I can't have that going on.

3
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,760
It scared me to death.

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:20,963
It's coming after this kid.

5
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,465
I love my family. I will fight for it.

6
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:26,068
This is dark and bloody ground here.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,703
It could hurt her.

8
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,105
I'm worried for the safety of his kid.

9
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:33,141
He says, "They broke my bones."

10
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:37,446
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

11
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:40,280
"You're mine. You can't escape."

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,643
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,776
What's happening?

14
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,877
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,313
It seems like a devil.

16
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,949
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,950
He's pissed off.

18
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,118
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,253
I felt real fear.

20
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,223
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,225
I think she's being murdered.

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,827
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,095
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,097
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,199
Serial killer pops in my head.

26
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,402
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,603
Nobody believes me.

28
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,071
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,340
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

30
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,075
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,111
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,312
Until the very end.

33
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,114
You got problems. I got news for you.

34
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,282
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,351
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

36
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,020
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,689
This is their house, the house of the dead.

38
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,541
I'm in Fort Barnwell, North Carolina.

39
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:53,512
It's a very small town about
two hours outside of Raleigh.

40
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,815
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Laura.

41
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,201
She says things are so bad in the house,

42
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,621
she's ready to pack her bags,
grab her 2-year-old, and leave.

43
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,258
The problem is, her husband
wants to stay and fight.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,360
She told me she's running out of options

45
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,594
and we're her last hope.

46
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:15,050
Before Amy arrives,

47
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,903
I look for any leading information.

48
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,673
This house has a lot of
artwork and family photos

49
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,509
that need to be covered or removed.

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,578
When I'm done,

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,997
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,097
Oh, boy.

53
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:55,941
There's a big problem in one of rooms here.

54
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,177
There's a lot of dead people there.

55
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,581
And they can't see each other,
but they can see the living.

56
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:06,151
So, whenever they see living people,

57
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,786
they all jump on them.

58
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,239
They want out of there.

59
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,593
It's like a way station
for the dead or something.

60
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,630
Whatever it is, it's a problem.

61
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,173
Well, Laura, you sounded like

62
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,909
you were ready to pack up
and leave when we spoke.

63
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,077
So, what's going on?

64
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,412
Pretty much as soon as we moved in,

65
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,015
we noticed small things started happening.

66
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,585
And it's gotten to the point
where it started to get

67
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,120
a little bit more aggressive.

68
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,090
And as a parent to a 2-year-old,

69
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,391
I can't have that in my home.

70
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,592
I can't have that going on.

71
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,394
Why don't you just move?

72
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,296
I don't want to be here.

73
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,064
But my husband's
grandfather built this home,

74
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,333
so he will not leave.

75
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,068
- He's refusing.
- Refusing.

76
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,703
I want to protect my daughter,

77
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,440
but I love my husband as well,
and I don't... You know?

78
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,576
- I can't just leave.
- Okay.

79
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,828
So, what are some of the
things that are happening?

80
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,147
Electronics do crazy things.

81
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,651
Things have moved on
their own across the room.

82
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,586
People physically touched.

83
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,756
People feel like they're
being watched sometimes,

84
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,525
and there's things my 2-year-old has said

85
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,327
that has been very shocking.

86
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,498
She's been in her room and
been talking to someone,

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,600
and my husband's gone in there and just,

88
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,468
"Who are you talking to?" "The man."

89
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,636
- Really?
- Yeah.

90
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,372
How'd you feel when she said that?

91
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,674
I was petrified.

92
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,642
For her to just come up
with that out of nowhere

93
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,946
was very strange to us.

94
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,015
It seems to be drawn to her.

95
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,895
What the hell?

96
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,032
They're thinking that they're seeing,

97
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,102
like, a shadow person.

98
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,904
Who's "they"?

99
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,707
The living people here.

100
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,910
And there's a kid, definitely a kid.

101
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,684
And it's very aware of the kid.

102
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,952
And it's, like,

103
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,455
the way it's moving is very... like this...

104
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,828
To, like, grab the kid.

105
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,933
And, uh, there's, like,
stuff coming off of it.

106
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:39,404
Like, it has all this stuff
dripping off of its body.

107
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,239
What do you mean?

108
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,543
It almost looks like, like, um, tar, or...

109
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,847
you know, some kind of liquid.

110
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,066
What the [bleep]

111
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:54,519
It's coming after this kid.

112
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,131
This is where I kind of had
my final breaking point,

113
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,667
and why I wanted to call you guys in.

114
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,768
Okay.

115
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,037
I was actually sitting in the living room,

116
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,838
and I heard a very... very odd noise.

117
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,057
And when I walked around the corner,

118
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,309
I came through here,

119
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:23,481
and this playroom door had opened.

120
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,484
And it was shoving all
of this out of the way

121
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,154
so that this door was completely opened

122
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,488
against this wall.

123
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,326
Okay. So, you hear...

124
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,794
Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,263
I mean, I can't even really
do it without pushing it.

126
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,731
Yeah.

127
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,783
So, you got dogs?

128
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:44,035
Yes. They were going bananas.

129
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,004
But were they the ones that
caused the door to open?

130
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,006
No, they were all sitting on my lap.

131
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,441
We were just watching TV.

132
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,577
And you're sure nobody broke
into the house and then split?

133
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,679
I got a gun out and did a whole
walk-through of the house.

134
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,115
Now, do you get anything else in this room?

135
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,000
Sometimes people have felt watched

136
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,385
in this area of the house.

137
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,220
What areas are we talking about?

138
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,456
Well, that bathroom.

139
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,642
I won't go in.

140
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,327
Geez.

141
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,512
I just don't like it at all.

142
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,530
- So, it's uncomfortable.
- It's very uncomfortable.

143
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,799
Creepy, yeah.

144
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,668
All right.

145
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,240
There's also a male here.

146
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,010
He likes the bathroom.

147
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,448
It makes him very happy.

148
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,184
It doesn't make any of
the living people happy,

149
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,619
but he likes it in here.

150
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,820
Why?

151
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:42,177
I think most of them feel, like, a presence.

152
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,829
Everything they do, they're being watched,

153
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,798
and it makes them feel uncomfortable,

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,367
like somebody's...
somebody's standing behind them.

155
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,605
For some reason, the dead men I'm seeing

156
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,341
are projecting themselves
as shadow people...

157
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,511
but they're not.

158
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,479
They're just conscious entities.

159
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:07,419
There's a female who
definitely sees this guy.

160
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,722
She has dark hair. It's fairly long.

161
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,942
Like, say she's washing her hands,

162
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:17,278
he'll, like, suddenly be behind her.

163
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,564
It just is constant,

164
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,468
and she hates it.

165
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,476
So, what's going on in here?

166
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,479
There's one time where I was here by myself,

167
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,814
sleeping right here.

168
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,783
And I just kind of felt and heard, you know,

169
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,986
someone kind of smoothing out the comforter

170
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,155
and, you know, tugging on the edge.

171
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,292
Really?
Did you see the blanket being tugged?

172
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,661
No, but I definitely have heard it,
and I felt it.

173
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,696
I probably would've been swinging at the air

174
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,565
if I would've heard something like that.

175
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,700
No, I think, um, at this point,

176
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,170
there was so many little
things that had been going on,

177
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,705
where we had just started

178
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,974
to almost, in a sense, ignore it.

179
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,443
- So, you got numb to everything
that's been happening. - Mm-hmm.

180
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,795
After we had our daughter,

181
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,547
we kind of couldn't turn a
blind eye to things anymore.

182
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,016
Well, picking on an adult is one thing.

183
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,067
Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,969
Picking on a baby is another story.

185
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,171
And even with all this,

186
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,306
moving's not an option for your husband?

187
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,475
He just feels, you know,

188
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,795
"This is my home, and I'm staying."

189
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,070
Ah

190
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,538
What?

191
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,141
This room is the way station for the dead,

192
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,610
and all of the activity

193
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,079
is tormenting a woman who lives here.

194
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,714
If the dead are around,

195
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:48,453
this woman gets horrible pain in her head.

196
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,223
It's because of her ability.

197
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,292
I think she can hear people

198
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,996
talking to her,

199
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,098
whispering to her.

200
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,935
They're coming out of the bed.

201
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,371
Touching, touching, touching.

202
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,976
It's, like, messing with her mind.

203
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,844
You know, "Hey!"

204
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,196
You know, "Hey, I'm here."

205
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,484
If she's around this room
all the [bleep] time,

206
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:24,188
it could hurt her in the long run, you know?

207
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,323
How?

208
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:30,662
Feeling, like, defeated. Defeated.

209
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,799
There's no hope. There's no hope.

210
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,051
So, Chris,
I was talking to your wife,

211
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,888
and she says there's no way you're leaving.

212
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,104
Correct.

213
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,840
I love my family, but this is our place.

214
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,358
I will fight for it.

215
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,911
She told me that you may not be so serious

216
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,095
about what's going on here.

217
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:11,714
I mean, is she accurate about that?

218
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:13,515
In a way, yes, and in a way, no.

219
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,117
I do write things off.

220
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,418
Okay, what are we talking about?

221
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,921
Me and my wife were in our bedroom,

222
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:21,757
asleep, and it was after
4:00 in the morning.

223
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,825
TV just came on.

224
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,394
I mean, it had to scare the hell out of you.

225
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:26,395
Absolutely.

226
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,663
Okay.

227
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:29,398
- And there was nobody here?
- No, no one here.

228
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,066
Anything else?

229
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,335
I've been touched, physically.

230
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:34,877
I stood up out of the recliner one night,

231
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,494
and just plain as day,
felt someone touch my shoulder

232
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,579
and felt like they shook it a little bit.

233
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,715
It wasn't a muscle spasm,

234
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,717
it wasn't drinking or anything like that.

235
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,718
It happened.

236
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,219
- You got a 2-year-old here.
- Yes.

237
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,220
A baby girl.

238
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,022
Yes.

239
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,124
And can you imagine her being
touched like you were touched?

240
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,759
No.

241
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,977
I take it seriously,

242
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,396
because I take my daughter's
welfare seriously.

243
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:59,199
If it wasn't for her,
we wouldn't be talking.

244
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,668
Okay. Uh, well, that being said,

245
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,205
what do you know about any
history on the property?

246
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,507
My grandfather built this house in '74.

247
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,077
His great-grandfather
purchased this property.

248
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,378
Wow. Okay.

249
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,146
- So, your family's been here a long time.
- A long time.

250
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,883
And there was a very major
Indian war fought here.

251
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:20,754
These supposedly have been repurposed

252
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,924
from Fort Barnwell from
the Tuscarora Indian War.

253
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,092
Wow.

254
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,627
This is my family's legacy.

255
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:30,831
I'm gonna fight for my house.
I'm gonna fight for our legacy.

256
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,238
There's this old person.

257
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,476
It's a man.

258
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:47,814
This person, I believe, is a former owner.

259
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:51,651
He seems to know his way around here.

260
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:57,591
He's still very sick from
whatever he died from,

261
00:12:57,593 --> 00:13:00,277
which was a long-term illness.

262
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,697
Like, he possibly has a little dementia.

263
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,937
And...

264
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,741
there's some kind of
race thing going on here.

265
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:20,080
He's desperate to stop it,

266
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:26,119
but he's not okay to do that.

267
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:34,428
He can't stop time enough
to stop the things he did.

268
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:44,104
So, Amy, I was talking to Laura
about the stuff going on here.

269
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,540
She says you guys have been
friends since high school.

270
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,643
Right. We've been friends
for a really long time.

271
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,545
So, I assume you spent
time here in the house.

272
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,512
Well, I used to.

273
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:54,281
Last time we were here,

274
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,549
terrifying things happened,

275
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,317
and we haven't been back since then.

276
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,718
Okay. Tell me the first thing.

277
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,454
I woke up in the middle of the night,

278
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,355
and those curtains over there were moving.

279
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:04,291
It was like someone was standing behind it.

280
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,226
What about the windows? Were they open?

281
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,260
No, they were closed.

282
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,129
Did you have the fan or anything else on?

283
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,947
No, there's nothing that could explain it.

284
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,199
So, what else has happened?

285
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,135
Early that morning,
my husband was going hunting,

286
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,171
and I thought that he was
sitting on the corner of the bed

287
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,372
putting his boots on.

288
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:22,542
And this edge dipped down,

289
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:25,412
and I looked over and
there was no one in here.

290
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:28,248
Now, when you felt this thing on the bed,
I mean,

291
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,883
how much pressure are we talking about?

292
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:33,320
I mean, it was like a grown
man was sitting on it.

293
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,807
I don't know that I'll
ever feel safe coming back

294
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,625
- with a child.
- Really?

295
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,094
Do you think Chris is taking it too lightly?

296
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,631
I do. I'm worried for the safety of his kid.

297
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,099
So am I. That's why I'm here.

298
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,951
I think he should take it more seriously,

299
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,636
before other things start happening.

300
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:59,513
Uh, there's been bad incidents in here.

301
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:05,485
Something lives in the closet.

302
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:11,157
I don't know what this is.
I don't know why it's here.

303
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,227
I just see something
coming out of the closet,

304
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:18,932
and, uh...

305
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,668
laying on someone

306
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,439
so the person can't move or anything.

307
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,278
Someone says, "Well, this is the room,

308
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,446
the room of death."

309
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,030
Chris told me he thought his house

310
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:53,065
was built on the site of some Indian wars.

311
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,467
I'm on my way to meet

312
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:56,235
with a local author who says it's true,

313
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:59,105
and those battles were some of the bloodiest

314
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:00,773
in North Carolina history.

315
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,681
So, Doc, what you said on the phone,

316
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:09,849
my client was right.

317
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:12,184
There were Native American
wars on the property.

318
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,452
All around it...

319
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:16,489
very serious wars back in the early 1700s.

320
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,207
Okay. So, what exactly happened?

321
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,025
What started the whole damn thing?

322
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:21,360
Settlers came in and took land.

323
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:22,795
That meant less land for Indians.

324
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,231
They're being abused by the settlers.

325
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:29,034
Indian women would be raped,
and men murdered.

326
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:34,206
There's also a vibrant
Indian slave trade by 1711.

327
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,376
They'd just grown fed up
with what was happening.

328
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,845
And for a three-day rampage,

329
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,231
they were attacking all these plantations,

330
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,750
these farms, killing men,
women and children,

331
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,219
also killing black slaves, too.

332
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:49,722
Okay. And this is all around
the property I'm investigating?

333
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:50,673
Yes.

334
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,491
So, how many did they wind up killing?

335
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:56,362
Well, about 140 people are
killed in the three days.

336
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,030
They are taken totally by surprise.

337
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,182
In fact, one settler who survived said,

338
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:01,567
"It's people that we knew.

339
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,103
We see smiling faces,
and then they attacked us."

340
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,037
How brutal was it?

341
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,840
A lot of them are hatcheted,

342
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:10,142
knifed, and often, their bodies

343
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:14,180
were put in, like,
positions of prayer in some cases.

344
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:16,115
We also have stories of pregnant women

345
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,650
having the babies ripped out.

346
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,418
Some of them are impaled.

347
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,554
I mean, this is pretty brutal right there.

348
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:26,926
What the [bleep]

349
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:29,829
There's, like,
people all lined up against the wall.

350
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:34,166
They're all fresh, like, fresh corpses.

351
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:36,969
They're all white. Quite a few women.

352
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:39,839
All I can get is, like, they're running.

353
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,560
I don't see what the [bleep]
they're running from.

354
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,545
I feel like it's unexpected.

355
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,281
I think it was a normal
day to start out with,

356
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:52,718
and then this sudden panic,
and then running,

357
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,421
running for your life.

358
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,189
And then they're here like this.

359
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:01,293
These are all people
this happened to that day

360
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:06,699
and probably didn't have a good burial.

361
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,987
I'm curious about the white settlers.

362
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,939
What happened with their bodies?

363
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,141
They complained about,
"We can't bury our dead

364
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,977
"until the wolves are eating our dead

365
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,879
and the vultures are eating our dead."

366
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:23,782
People were too afraid to
leave those fortified houses,

367
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:26,085
and the Indians kind of
go back to their villages

368
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,887
to wait and see what's gonna happen.

369
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,089
They're expecting a response.

370
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,993
So, North Carolina calls
on South Carolina for help.

371
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:36,862
They send Colonel John Barnwell.

372
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,898
He goes to this place called Core Town,

373
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,634
and he turns it into Fort Barnwell.

374
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:44,203
My client believes the
bricks from his fireplace

375
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,504
came from Fort Barnwell.

376
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,839
Well, it's possible.

377
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,307
So, what happens next?

378
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,644
John Barnwell,
he's willing to sign a peace treaty.

379
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,647
And so the Indians said,
"Great, we'll sign one."

380
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,017
Over 400 Indians show up,
men, women, and children.

381
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,536
They're expecting to sign a treaty.

382
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,855
And then, at a surprise moment,

383
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,990
Barnwell and these militia attack.

384
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:09,094
About 50 Indians are just killed right off,

385
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:11,397
and most women and
children are then enslaved.

386
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,532
This is dark and bloody ground here.

387
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:17,469
I don't know why

388
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:20,205
they're all stuck in
the wall here like this.

389
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,440
How many?

390
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,379
About 18.

391
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:31,550
They can't move. They can't speak.

392
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:35,254
It feels like something bad happened,
whatever.

393
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,355
They all die right...

394
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:38,524
They're all together like this,

395
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,260
and why they're kind of, like, bound...

396
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,296
Like, this would be a binding on the dead...

397
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:45,831
is very [bleep] weird.

398
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,368
Someone put some sort of
spell on these dead people.

399
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,271
They can think and see,
but they are all stuck together,

400
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,839
unable to move or communicate.

401
00:19:53,841 --> 00:20:00,613
I want to say that they were
put together even after death.

402
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:05,351
This is, uh...

403
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:10,322
terrible.

404
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,474
With hundreds killed

405
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,777
during Native American wars in the 1700s,

406
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,111
my client's land has seen

407
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,681
more than its fair share
of death and violence.

408
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:36,383
But something tells me the
tragedy didn't end there.

409
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,786
Digging through the archives,

410
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,823
I find a local farmhand
burned to death in the 1940s.

411
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,391
Turns out he worked

412
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:47,595
for my client's great-great-grandfather.

413
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:49,663
Fires are always suspicious,

414
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,799
and I want to know more
about the worker that died

415
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,133
on Chris and Laura's property.

416
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,553
I'm heading over to meet
with a history professor

417
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,004
who's looking into it for me.

418
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,380
I found out during my research

419
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,515
that my client's great-great-grandfather

420
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,752
had a farmhand who burned to
death right on the property.

421
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,787
What do you know about
this guy and what happened?

422
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,290
William Loften was a farmhand

423
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:20,828
who lived on Hugh Lane's Farm in the 1940s.

424
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,797
He was a World War II veteran.

425
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,765
Okay.

426
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,134
And when he returned from the war,

427
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,803
he went back to work on the farm.

428
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,438
So, what happened?

429
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,374
March 14, 1949...

430
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:37,011
Sometime in the night, he was asleep.

431
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,512
The house caught on fire.

432
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:41,332
His wife came home to
see the house collapsing.

433
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,416
Geez.

434
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:43,684
I have a death certificate,

435
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:47,788
and it says that he died from extreme burns.

436
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,858
Okay. Do they know what might
have caused the fire then?

437
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,426
What the newspaper, the<i> Sun Journal,</i> says

438
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:56,313
is that the fire was started
by a stove that overheated.

439
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,033
Now, Kate, according to the
article I came across,

440
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,517
it said five black farmhands

441
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,736
were killed within a week from burning.

442
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,772
It sounds suspicious to me,

443
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:05,397
'cause when you read the article,

444
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:08,064
right away I'm thinking there's
racial undertones to it.

445
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:11,610
Was the Klan active back in
'49 in the Fort Barnwell area?

446
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,811
Well, there were pockets of Klan activity,

447
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,080
but there wasn't anything

448
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,316
that indicates that it was suspicious.

449
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,686
So, Kate, looking at this case,
as far as the victim goes,

450
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,290
it's a fire that can be
easily made to look accidental

451
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,392
and be a crime, or just accidental.

452
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,661
I mean, I don't think we'll ever know.

453
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,162
It's something to think about.

454
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:38,902
Those corpses are
still kind of in the wall.

455
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:42,973
Yeah, they're bound. They're bound.

456
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,945
I don't think that any of these people

457
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:50,013
deserve to be like this.

458
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,416
But that shadow,

459
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:57,354
it thinks that they do
deserve to be like this.

460
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,324
But this is the same person
that the kid was seeing?

461
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:04,561
Yes. He's saying, "Oh, you know,
'cause they're white people,

462
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,797
then that's why you're siding with them."

463
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,933
He's crawling.

464
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,837
So, he can't stand up
because it hurts too much.

465
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,908
He says, "They broke my bones."

466
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,843
Do you know when he's from?

467
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:22,246
It feels more recent to me.

468
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,848
It doesn't look like he died very well.

469
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,785
It was at night, but also warm.

470
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,922
This is uncomfortable.

471
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:35,926
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

472
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,697
So, we've got brutal Indian wars

473
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:43,934
and a worker who burned to
death on my client's property.

474
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,736
But one other thing caught my attention

475
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,137
while I was doing my research...

476
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:51,041
a murder-suicide that involved one of Chris'
ancestors.

477
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,810
I'm heading over to meet a historian

478
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,813
who says it's a case of obsessive love.

479
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:05,622
I came across this article
during my research,

480
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:09,593
and it looks like a
distant cousin of my client

481
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,061
was involved in a murder-suicide.

482
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:12,279
This guy Lonnie Lane.

483
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:14,631
Now, do you know anything about this guy?

484
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,601
He was a young man. He was born in 1879.

485
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,870
When he was 20 years old,

486
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,673
he apparently began a
relationship of some sort

487
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:25,542
with a young girl named Glennie Sauls.

488
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,011
This was in the spring of 1899.

489
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:30,647
But she was only 14 years old.

490
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,115
Her parents objected to the relationship

491
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,216
because of the age difference,

492
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:36,019
so they basically forbid him to see her.

493
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,989
In March... March 24, 1899,

494
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:40,407
he apparently went to her house

495
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:41,992
while her parents were out of town.

496
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,794
And they were seen leaving the house

497
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,629
and going on a walk toward the woods.

498
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,597
Okay. So, what happens next?

499
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,200
They're not seen for the
rest of the afternoon.

500
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,135
And when nightfall comes,
people become concerned

501
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:53,570
and they begin to search for them,

502
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:54,938
and their bodies are found in the woods,

503
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,306
both shot in the head.

504
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:00,110
So, here's one of the articles that appeared,
and it gives

505
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:02,346
the details of their relationship

506
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:04,648
and what may have happened that afternoon.

507
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,083
There's been some speculation

508
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:07,951
that he wanted to propose marriage to her

509
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:10,287
and that she may have rejected him

510
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,122
and then he just couldn't
deal with that rejection.

511
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,257
And the speculation was that

512
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,727
he had shot her and then
turned the gun on himself.

513
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:24,801
This guy who's always in the bathroom,

514
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:31,575
I think somehow he's
related to the living here.

515
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:37,748
He had said that he died outside.

516
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,585
He has something that's,
like, hanging off of him.

517
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:44,187
Like, if it's moss.

518
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:47,391
I don't think it was a good death.

519
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:59,569
During my walk, I saw a group of dead people

520
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,472
trying to get the attention of the living

521
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,040
in the master bedroom.

522
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:08,178
I'm meeting with an artist to
describe this horrifying scene.

523
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,515
There's two people sleeping in the bed.

524
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:16,052
There's a bunch of dead people,
like, holding their legs...

525
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:18,488
Four on one side and
like three on the other.

526
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,462
Is this what you saw?

527
00:26:26,664 --> 00:26:28,445
Yes. That's what I saw.

528
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,652
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

529
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,928
it's time to reveal our findings
to our clients and each other

530
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,360
for the first time.

531
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,071
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Chris and Laura.

532
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:04,606
The activity here is pretty bad,
up to the point where

533
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,408
Laura's ready to pack up her bags and leave.

534
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,712
Now, this property has been in Chris' family

535
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,014
- for generations.
- Okay.

536
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:16,034
So, he does not want to leave,
no matter what.

537
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:17,318
But one thing they both agree on,

538
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,187
they're worried about
their 2-year-old daughter,

539
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,889
and that's why we're here.

540
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:23,425
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

541
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:27,095
I'm gonna have her tell us about her walk.

542
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:33,701
There were a couple of individuals

543
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:38,339
who initially showed
themselves like shadow figures,

544
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:40,158
but they're not.

545
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,195
One of them loves the
bathroom because it's quiet.

546
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,147
It's like his sanctuary.

547
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:47,816
And there was a living woman

548
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:52,253
that I saw that he keyed in on,
and she had dark hair.

549
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,055
And he's standing right behind her.

550
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,708
And one of the things in the bathroom

551
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,527
was this sense of always being watched.

552
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,997
When we first moved in, I hated the bathroom

553
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,165
I hated it.

554
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,202
Like, the first two years we lived here,

555
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,937
I wouldn't go in there.

556
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,288
Interesting.

557
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,875
And, uh, my daughter,
she'll stay in that bathroom.

558
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:16,344
She's mentioned talking to a man before.

559
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,363
She has mentioned
talking to a man before.

560
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,214
Wow.

561
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:20,348
Okay.

562
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,717
Now, do you know
anything about this guy,

563
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,536
who he was in life?

564
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,122
Well, he was about 6 feet tall, thin.

565
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,924
He indicated that he died outside.

566
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:33,595
He had something kind of hanging off him,

567
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:35,296
like a moss or a mold or something.

568
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,933
I got that this was not a good death.

569
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:41,603
I kind of think that he was murdered.

570
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:44,105
It does bring to mind one story

571
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:45,740
that took place right near here,

572
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,043
and it involves a distant relative of yours.

573
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:53,348
His name was Lonnie Lane.
He was 20 years old.

574
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,250
He got involved with a 14-year-old girl,

575
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:57,952
this girl Glennie Sauls.

576
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,421
Now, her parents were not happy
about them being together.

577
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:02,490
They didn't like the idea
of the age difference,

578
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:07,896
but one day in March of 1899,
the parents were away.

579
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,247
Lonnie came to Glennie's house.

580
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,499
They both left and walked into the woods,
never came out.

581
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,836
They were both found later,
one shot to the head each.

582
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,273
Here's the article from it.

583
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,741
So, when she said the moss,

584
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:21,320
the only thing I'm thinking
was they were in the woods.

585
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,386
They did die outside.

586
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,021
I've heard of
Lonnie Lane in our family.

587
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:26,589
- Really?
- Yes.

588
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:27,724
I didn't know about this.

589
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:32,946
That's one of the people
that's presenting themselves

590
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:36,686
- kind of like a shadow person, but it's not.
- No.

591
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,452
Okay. So, who's the second guy?

592
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:42,940
I walked in, went into this
area by that door in the hall,

593
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:45,342
and he was, like, covered

594
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,648
in, like, a black ooze, oil, tar substance.

595
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,320
And he was actually
interacting with a child.

596
00:29:56,322 --> 00:30:02,126
And the kid was freaked out.

597
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:03,327
And it's, like,

598
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:06,130
the way it's moving is very... like this...

599
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:10,701
To, like, grab the kid.

600
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:14,738
It's coming after this kid.

601
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,911
I did get that he was black,
and he hates white people.

602
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:26,250
I also got that he died outside,
and it was nighttime.

603
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:29,887
And one word that I was hearing was "warm."

604
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:31,822
"Warm"

605
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:34,592
All right, well,

606
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,944
there was an incident where a guy got killed

607
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,696
on this property back in 1949.

608
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:40,898
He was a black guy. He was 35 years old.

609
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,435
His name was William Loften.

610
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:46,737
Now, Loften was a tenant farmer

611
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:49,506
for your great-great-grandfather Hugh.

612
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,042
Now, you had mentioned
that he died at night.

613
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:53,978
- You heard "warm?"
- Yep.

614
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,714
On March 14, 1949,

615
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:58,682
his house caught fire,

616
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:02,553
and he was burned to death inside the house.

617
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:04,021
This is the guy's death certificate.

618
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:06,590
Now, the official cause listed is burns.

619
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:09,493
Police say it was a stove
that caused the fire,

620
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:13,631
but what I found odd,

621
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:17,902
there was article that says
"Fifth Negro Burns at Farm."

622
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:23,361
The historian said there was
Klan activity here at the time.

623
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:24,647
There was.

624
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:28,182
But a fire like that's easily
done to make it look accidental.

625
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:29,250
Mm-hmm.

626
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:37,792
When I walked in the living room area,

627
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:40,161
I look at the wall,

628
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:44,632
and there was about 15 to
18 corpses standing upright.

629
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:48,319
All of these people were together,

630
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:52,640
and for some reason, somebody bound them.

631
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,375
What does that mean?

632
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:57,712
Someone at some point put a spell on them.

633
00:31:57,714 --> 00:32:01,883
So, they can see everything that's going on,

634
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:05,319
but they can't speak and they can't move.

635
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:10,141
Who would've been in the
house that would've bound...

636
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:12,260
Well, that's the thing.

637
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:15,863
The other part of what I got was that

638
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:18,749
most of these people were female.

639
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,468
They were all white.

640
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,671
All of them seemed to have
died at the same time.

641
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:26,841
I saw it was, like, a nice day.

642
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,910
All of a sudden, everybody's running.

643
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:31,379
I know that they were
running for their lives.

644
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:37,118
Something was done with their bodies.

645
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,390
Like, I don't know if it was a mass grave,
desecration.

646
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:43,524
That sounds spot-on

647
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,126
for something that happened
here 300 years ago.

648
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:51,332
In 1711, the Tuscarora Indians went,
basically, nuts

649
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,234
and started attacking everybody and killing
'em,

650
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,336
'cause the white settlers that were here

651
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,804
were stealing from them.

652
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,973
They were raping their women.

653
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:04,045
So, they decided to attack
them in a three-day rampage.

654
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:08,182
They killed 140 men, women, and children.

655
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:09,784
They mutilated the bodies.

656
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:12,119
They ripped babies from
pregnant women's stomachs.

657
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:13,454
Oh, my goodness.

658
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:15,189
So, now, they were so scared

659
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:18,292
they couldn't even go and
get their bodies to bury 'em.

660
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,861
So, after this attack happened,

661
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,631
North Carolina decided to
reach out to South Carolina

662
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,299
for help.

663
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:27,318
They sent a guy named Colonel John Barnwell.

664
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,638
So, what Barnwell wound up
doing is setting up a fort,

665
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,940
Fort Barnwell, right near here.

666
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:35,626
So, what he did was try
to sign a peace treaty

667
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:37,912
and said, "All right, come to the fort

668
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:41,082
and we'll sign this treaty,
and everything will be nice."

669
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,683
So, 400 Native Americans came,

670
00:33:42,685 --> 00:33:44,885
thinking it was gonna be a celebration.

671
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,455
So, they came with kids, women.

672
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:48,656
Barnwell attacked.

673
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,341
They weren't expecting it.

674
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:52,159
50 of them died right away,

675
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,428
and the rest,
they basically took into slavery

676
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,314
and sent them down to South Carolina

677
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:58,833
to be put in the slave trade.

678
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:02,269
Matter of fact, see this fireplace here?

679
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:04,789
That was built from bricks

680
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,708
that was from the fort that Barnwell built.

681
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,910
Oh, gosh.

682
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:11,912
My grandfather built this house.

683
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:13,748
- Your grandfather built this house?
- In '74.

684
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,216
Wow. Okay.

685
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:19,553
Well, I wasn't sure if he lived here or not,

686
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:25,359
but I saw this elderly
man in the living room.

687
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,796
He was very attached to this location,

688
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:32,433
and I got that he died
from a long-term illness.

689
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:37,405
The other thing was there were things

690
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:41,325
that happened that he felt responsible for,

691
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:44,812
that had possibly led to some deaths,

692
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:47,748
and it involved racial issues.

693
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,403
And he was like, "It's all my fault."

694
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:55,439
So, I don't know if the illness affected him

695
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,725
or if he also had, like,
a little bit of dementia

696
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,959
or something like that,

697
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:02,313
because he's very lost, very confused.

698
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:05,232
You're talking of my grandfather.

699
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:09,937
He had Parkinson's,
and he had a lot of dementia.

700
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,239
Okay.

701
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:16,477
This was his dream home.

702
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,445
Take that.

703
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,647
This was his pride and joy.

704
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,165
Sorry.

705
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:25,519
But why would he blame himself
for the racial tension, though?

706
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:30,758
Yeah, I'd really rather not talk about it.

707
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:38,432
Some of these people
that would be brought into this

708
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,284
are still living,
and I don't want to hurt feelings.

709
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:42,703
No, no, no. It's totally understandable.

710
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,272
But you are talking about my grandfather.

711
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:48,576
This is crazy.

712
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:55,800
Anything else?

713
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,953
I went into the master bedroom,

714
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:01,021
and I saw a living woman there...

715
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:03,457
thin, dark hair.

716
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:06,994
And she looked defeated.

717
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:09,563
She was sitting on the side of the bed,

718
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,432
like [bleep]

719
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:15,803
I got that she's having a lot of pain,

720
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:17,605
really bad headaches.

721
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:20,541
In that area, a whole bunch
of dead people came out.

722
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:25,079
They can't really see anything,
but they can see living people.

723
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:28,048
And I saw two people in the bed

724
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,786
and the dead people surrounding
them and touching them.

725
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:37,224
They were trying to, you know,
get people's attention.

726
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:40,127
You were telling me about it
happening in the master bedroom.

727
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:41,962
Mm-hmm. I remember laying in bed,

728
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,298
and it was just, like, fluttering

729
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,933
over the end of the bed,

730
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:49,503
like, maybe smoothing it out,
pulling the corners down.

731
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:50,938
Okay.

732
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,239
But you've been grabbed.

733
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:54,208
Definitely.

734
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,178
It was just, like, you know?
Like, "Hey, I'm here."

735
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,746
Wow.

736
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:04,185
Well, I did do a sketch of what I saw.

737
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,261
That looks like you in the bed.

738
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,225
I don't like it.

739
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,084
You okay?

740
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:48,000
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

741
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,177
That looks like you in the bed.

742
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:07,419
I don't like it.

743
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:13,325
You okay?

744
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:30,629
I have countless times sat on that bed

745
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:33,463
and cried on that bed

746
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,515
and just been like. "[bleep]"

747
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:38,234
Like, "Why did I move out here?

748
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:41,104
But what do they want? What do they want?

749
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:43,273
They don't want to be here anymore,

750
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,374
because they're stuck.

751
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:49,312
And the female in particular has abilities.

752
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:55,952
And so the dead are very attracted to that.

753
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:58,588
And they want help,
and they don't want to be here anymore.

754
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,156
I mean, did you have any idea?

755
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:01,174
I knew it was me.

756
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,258
Deep... I knew...

757
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,561
in the back of my head, it was me.

758
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:05,729
I knew it.

759
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:08,865
I didn't want to say it ever, out loud,

760
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,166
but I knew it.

761
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:13,169
So, now, what's got me
concerned is the baby.

762
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,238
The baby sees stuff and talks to stuff.

763
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,374
I'm 100% positive of that.

764
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,009
I'm 100% positive of that,

765
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:21,811
and that's the only
reason why y'all are here.

766
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:25,115
Well, when we spoke,
you said you'd do anything,

767
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:27,000
short of selling this house,

768
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:29,219
- to protect your family.
- Correct.

769
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:31,438
Okay. So, now we're gonna
find out what it's gonna take.

770
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,856
So, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

771
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:34,924
and see what she's got for us.

772
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:43,533
So, there's a few steps,
and it'll take a little while.

773
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:45,295
What needs to be done first

774
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:49,497
is a male who's black who's also a medium

775
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:55,436
needs to come in and make contact

776
00:39:55,438 --> 00:40:00,107
with the male that's in
the living room area.

777
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,710
He needs to talk to him and listen to him

778
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:06,047
and work with him to move him on.

779
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:09,917
Then, the second day, he needs to come back

780
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:13,487
and deal with the master-bedroom situation,

781
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:14,855
which he needs to seal.

782
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,857
When he's doing the sealing,

783
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,693
the last thing I do want him to do

784
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:21,295
is to use tar water at the end.

785
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,747
This is something

786
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:26,167
that completely negates
the space for the dead.

787
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:28,636
So, there will never be another dead person

788
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:30,538
that comes in that room, ever.

789
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,008
After that,

790
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,846
a shaman needs to be
contacted from the tribe.

791
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:39,980
Tuscarora tribe.

792
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:42,113
- Yeah.
- Okay.

793
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:45,247
So, they need to come and do a release

794
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:48,016
for the people that are trapped in the wall

795
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:51,353
'cause they are the only ones
who can undo what they did.

796
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:54,189
Once that's done,

797
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:57,125
the elderly gentleman, your grandfather,

798
00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:01,330
will leave of his own accord
'cause he'll feel good.

799
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:03,158
So, now, what about her
abilities and the baby?

800
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:04,925
Her bedroom is going to be

801
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:10,664
completely sealed forever
from any dead coming in.

802
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,834
What happens if one day your
daughter comes to you and says,

803
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:16,069
you know, "All this stuff is happening."

804
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:17,587
Would you want her to close up?

805
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:19,272
Yeah.

806
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:21,908
You guys won't know until
she's a little bit older

807
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,811
if she's going to be open

808
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:28,181
or if she's going to close down or repress.

809
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:31,251
So, it's kind of a waiting game right now

810
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,753
to see which way she's gonna go.

811
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:36,556
So, I want to ask you straight out,

812
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:39,492
are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

813
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:40,527
Absolutely.

814
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:41,361
Okay.

815
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:42,379
100%.

816
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,130
Okay, good. I'm glad to hear that.

817
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:45,799
Yeah, I want this house to be ours...

818
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:48,869
me, her, my daughter's.

819
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:51,938
I'm concerned for Laura and Chris,

820
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,076
as the dead within their home
pose a very serious danger.

821
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:58,111
But I believe if they follow my advice,

822
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:00,981
they'll remain safe and
live a peaceful life,

823
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:04,451
keeping their home in the
family for generations to come.
