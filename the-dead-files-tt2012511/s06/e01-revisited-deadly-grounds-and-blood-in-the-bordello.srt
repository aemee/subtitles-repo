NARRATOR: Tonight
on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,776
Oh, he's pissed now.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,210
NARRATOR:...a second look

5
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:15,181
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases...

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,833
Looks like scratch marks.

...new information...

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,917
We wanted him out of here.

NARRATOR:
...startling revelations.

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,455
You wonder
if they ever will stop.

11

NARRATOR: First, a return
to Wabash, Indiana...

12
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,329
I don't know how
to make it better.

13
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,964
...where a mysterious portal...

14
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,199
There is a doorway here.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,652
...releases an ancient evil.

16
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,105
They're all **** mental.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,372
Then...

18
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,474
There's something attacking
my wife.

19
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,545
...we travel back
to an Ohio restaurant...

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,245
They're all crying
in the corner.

NARRATOR:
...where disturbing spirits...

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,751
They deserve
to be punished.

...threaten the living.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,989
There's a female
that he wants to kill.

00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,556
Did they face their fears...

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,591
You guys are definitely
gonna do this.

27
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,626
...or does the nightmare
continue?

28
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,096
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

29
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:08,233
and the Holy Spirit,
amen.

30
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,670
They're being watched.

31
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:13,073
My name is Amy Allan.

32
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,275
This thing likes death.

33
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,075
I see dead people.

34
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,779
This thing's, like,
a monster.

35
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,530
I speak to dead people.

36
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,247
And he's pissed off now.

37
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,767
And they speak to me.

38
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,251
His head was cracked.

39
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,056
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

40
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,122
This guy was murdered.

41
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,875
I rely on my partner.

42
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,592
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

43
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,862
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

44
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,666
I cannot help you
unless I know the whole story.

45
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,435
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

46
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,802
You saw her?

47
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,954
It's my job to reveal them.

48
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,037
Why would you
stay here?

49
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,239
But Steve and I never speak...

50
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,142
We never communicate
during an investigation.

51
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,778
...until the very end.

52
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,344
[ Echoing ] Stop it.

00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,314
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

WOMAN:
I want to know the truth.

55
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:57,717
I want to know
what's happening.

56
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:58,983
Or time to get out.

57
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,254
[ Crying ] I told you
there were ghosts in this house.

58
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,570
When I got the call from Suzanne
and B.J. in Wabash, Indiana,

59
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,774
I knew right away that those two
were paralyzed by fear.

60
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,943
And as soon as I entered
the home to hear their story,

61
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,646
I was determined to help.

62
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,617
Now that I'm here, why don't you
explain what's going on?

63
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,186
Well, we've been having
a lot of experiences here --

64
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:38,756
myself, my husband,
my three kids.

65
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,594
Okay. Like what?
Give me a for instance.

66
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,632
[ Crying ] Sorry.

67
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,465
It's okay.

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,685
[ Sniffles ]
It really gets down deep.

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,871
My children
were being severely affected

70
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,671
by what was going on here.

71
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,274
It's hard enough
just to raise kids,

72
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:01,113
let alone when they're seeing
and hearing things

73
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,816
and you don't have an answer
for them.

74
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,052
We've seen an apparition.

75
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,620
Footsteps, voices.

76
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,561
I just don't want my children
to be scared of their own house.

77
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,966
I don't know
how to make it better.

78
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,634
[ Sniffles ]

79
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,333
AMY: As I pulled up
to the location,

80
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,485
I could already sense
a serious threat,

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,118
and it was so overwhelming,

82
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,953
I didn't even
have to walk inside

83
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:46,226
to know that the problem was
there long before the house.

84
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,829
There is a doorway here...

85
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,697
for -- for dead people.

86
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:58,805
But I opened it, and it was,
like, endless darkness.

87
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,907
And it's a darkness

88
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,045
that's layers of depression.

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,219
These dark, black hands
came out to grab me.

90
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,223
And it wanted to wrap me in it.

91
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,993
Okay, Suzanne, why did you
bring me in this room?

92
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,346
There was a time
when I woke up

93
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,629
in the middle
of the night to a --

94
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:28,817
what I thought was
a man's voice yelling, "Hey,"

95
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,970
on the baby monitor,
and then she started screaming.

96
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,273
I ran into the bedroom
to get her,

97
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,344
and that's when I walked
into a black mass,

98
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:43,681
like if you would
walk into blackness.

99
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:49,305
It's just...dealing
with this every single day

100
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,894
for the past seven years --
it's been very trying.

101
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:58,965
It just...
is very overwhelming,

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,001
and you wonder
if it ever will stop.

103
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,145
AMY: There's a big, solid,
black mass.

104
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,118
And a bunch of people
that are halfway in the walls.

105
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,918
And they're see-through.

106
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,421
Could this maybe
be the portal?

107
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,889
Yeah.

108
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,359
It's been here
for...ever.

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,664
A portal typically allows
the dead to pass in and out

110
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,864
of our world with ease.

111
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,636
But that black mass had
a different plan for the dead.

112
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,374
And what about
the -- the big mass?

113
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,743
It's keeping them trapped.

114
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,516
STEVE: Suzanne's home had been
in her husband's family

115
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,882
for three generations.

116
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:56,121
These days, that's an impressive
track record for any homeowner.

117
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,822
But after speaking
with her husband,

118
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,259
it was apparent that he was
ready to throw away

119
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,195
the family legacy
to protect his kids.

120
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,370
STEVE:
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about what's going on?

121
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,173
The thing that's happened with
the kids, first it was Macy.

122
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,374
She's the oldest,
and when she was about 3,

123
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,613
she started saying that she's
seeing monsters and ghosts.

124
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:24,817
I thought it was kind of odd,
but now that Andy is 3,

125
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,686
Andy has said
the same thing.

126
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,091
As a parent, you're supposed
to protect your children,

127
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,592
and not really knowing
what's going on

128
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,130
and how to protect them,
it gets stressful.

129
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,165
Are they experiencing
anything else?

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,566
In this room,

131
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,504
we had something that would
mimic what was being said.

132
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,407
So, whatever you guys are
talking about, something's...

133
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,376
- Repeating it.
- Like a parrot. - Yes. - Okay.

134
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,028
I want my children
to be able

135
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,645
to feel safe in their home,

136
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,784
where they don't have to worry
about monsters.

137
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,373
AMY:
There is a lady here.

138
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,558
She rules this structure.

139
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:17,135
This lady -- she is able
to manipulate sound waves.

140
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,140
So she could make noise, noise.

141
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,327
I do feel like
people see her, though.

142
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,346
- Like, the younger people
in the house. - Uh-huh.

143
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,217
It would be, like,
a white mist, you know?

144
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:34,053
You know, she's
very smothering, you know?

145
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,295
She wants to make clear
that she's a protector.

146
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,963
Why do you say that?
Like --

147
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,101
'Cause she thinks that
the adults here are satanic.

148

NARRATOR: Next...

149
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,603
She died of a broken heart.

150
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,624
...a lost soul
unleashes her wrath.

151
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,611
She thinks she's here
to do God's work.

152
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,746
And in our second
investigation...

153
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,281
My wife was assaulted here.

154
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,099
...a dangerous presence...

155
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,883
He would like them to die.

156
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,652
...just won't leave.

157
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,522
"Be gone, accursed Dragon."

158
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,957
Amen.

159
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,005
STEVE: After talking
to Suzanne and B.J.,

160
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,373
there was no question
they were terrified.

161
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,110
But all I knew was that B.J.'s
family had lived on the property

162
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,509
for over 100 years

163
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:35,746
and nothing questionable
happened during that time.

164
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,717
So I had no choice
but to dig a little deeper.

165
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,759
So, Heather,
what were you able to find out

166
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,212
about the property
I'm investigating?

167
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,630
I found that
Maggie and Edwin Williams

168
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,263
were the first
white settlers.

169
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,765
What do you mean,
"white settlers"?

170
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,835
Well, the land was actually
owned by a Miami Indian tribe.

171
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,822
Okay. So what can you tell me
about the Williamses?

172
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:03,809
They were devout Christians.
They were Presbyterians.

173
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,077
They were active
in their small church.

174
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,311
How many kids
did they have?

175
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,645

00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,166
So, the first thing
I want you to do

349
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,332
is to find a deacon

350
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:27,003
who can do a blessing
for Margaret,

351
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,642
the pious woman
and tell her she can go now.

352
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,111
The second thing
is to seal the pathway

353
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,212
with tar-water
and brick dust.

354
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,651
Now, the last thing you need
to do is deal with Poqua.

355
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:45,088
You're gonna have to go
to the Miami tribe,

356
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:48,193
and you're going to ask them
to send a medicine man.

357
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,994
STEVE:
Will this get rid of him?

358
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,129
Yes.

359
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,764
So, once they do all this,

360
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,603
will these guys be able
to raise their kids here safely?

361
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,687
So, when Amy left,
the activity really increased.

362
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,622
The kids were
seeing things daily,

363
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:23,495
and the noises in the house
were just unbearable.

364
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:30,668
DEACON: Leave those who live
in this house in peace.

365
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,305
The deacon came in,
and he did a house blessing.

366
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,908
DEACON: We wish for you
to enter into the light

367
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,543
for all eternity.

368
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,647
Leave those who live
in peace, amen.

369
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,716
SUZANNE:
And then I went to the basement

370
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,186
and took the tar-water
and the brick dust

371
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,686
that Amy had given us

372
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,325
and sealed both sides of
the pathway as she instructed.

373
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,565
We had some challenges
getting the Miami tribe here.

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,767
The first shaman
got very, very sick

375
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,571
and put into the hospital
and never came.

376
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:12,511
The thought did cross my mind
that Poqua could be interfering.

377
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,681
Fortunately, the tribe was able
to send another member

378
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,482
to come help us out.

379
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,785
WOMAN: We ask the spirits
to leave this place.

380
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,858
SUZANNE: She started off by
burning sage through the house.

381
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,977
We cleanse this home.

382
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:31,027
Let them have their home.

383
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,630
B.J.:
She was almost in a trance

384
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,968
as she was walking around
blessing the house.

385
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,272
WOMAN: We ask the spirits
to leave this place.

386
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,808
SUZANNE:
Then she went into the backyard

387
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,945
and started the tribal ceremony.

388
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,047
WOMAN:
Leave these people in peace.

389
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,018
SUZANNE:
We don't know what happened,

390
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,618
but when she came back,

391
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,189
she informed me that Poqua
was seen running away.

392
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,592
Leave this place.
You are not welcome here.

393
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,397
Now that everything's done,

394
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,099
things in the house
have been quiet

395
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:13,271
and the kids are not having
any experiences.

396
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,074
I think there will always
be a concern

397
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,276
that things might stir up again,

398
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,043
but only time will tell

399
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,047
that everything we've done
for the children

400
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,716
is gonna make it better.

401
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,419
AMY:
I know the cleansing process

402
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,956
has been extremely stressful
for Suzanne and B.J.,

403
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,892
but the most important thing
is they've taken back control.

404
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,113
And now they have the tools
to keep their home

405
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:41,300
a safe environment
for generations to come.

406
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:56,464
STEVE: I'm sure that owning
a restaurant is hard work,

407
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:59,418
but for our clients at the
Jury Room in Columbus, Ohio,

408
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,484
their business
had gotten dangerous.

409
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,855
Unexplained activity in
the place was so out of control,

410
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,424
the owners were considering
shutting down.

411
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,326
But the moment
Amy and I walked in,

412
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,728
their luck started to change.

413
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,131
STEVE: So, Harold, you sounded
really concerned on the phone.

414
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,666
What's going on?

415
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:20,154
My wife and I just bought
the restaurant.

416
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:23,608
And recently employees
have started reporting

417
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,342
seeing apparitions,

418
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,610
seeing things moving around
on their own.

419
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:30,315
When we were given the keys
to the restaurant,

420
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,768
we were told that something
was here.

421
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:35,187
But it wasn't until we opened
the doors

422
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,121
that things began to happen.

423
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,725
A restaurant is
a dangerous enough place

424
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,159
with fire, slippery floors,
knives,

425
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,097
and that's without malevolent
forces threatening my staff.

426
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,699
Harold, I got to ask you,
what would you do

427
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,468
if Amy told you
you got to get out?

428
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,835
I hope that's not
the answer.

429
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,139
We have everything tied up
in this restaurant.

There's too much
going on.

AMY:
Walking into that restaurant,

432
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,468
it was like a wave
of negative energy

433
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,503
smacked me
right across the face.

434
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,890

And it's him.

I think it's a shadow man.

439
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:45,256
AMY: I've always been open about
my fear of shadow people.

440
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,458
It's something I've dealt with
my entire life,

441
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,364
and to start an investigation
this way was very disturbing.

00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,296
He's been here before.

447
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:09,147
Just was this really violent
push to the ground.

Oh, he's pissed now.

00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,167
STEVE: The owner of the Jury
Room had serious concerns

451
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,069
about what was happening
to his restaurant,

452
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,535
and once I got him talking,

453
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,704
it was apparent
that his biggest fear

454
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,392
was not being able to protect
the love of his life.

455
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:42,046
My first experience came
when we opened the bar.

456
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,180
I was standing
under the bar here,

457
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:48,485
and one of the pictures
fell off of the wall

458
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,888
and hit me squarely
on the head.

459
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:51,988
But the breaking point

460
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,757
was when my wife
was assaulted here.

461
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:58,129
We were bothered enough by what
was happening to the staff,

462
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,132
but the most frightening
episode for me

463
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,101
was when my wife
experienced a force

464
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,271
which pushed her to the ground.

465
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,371
That's when it began to turn,

00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,908
and I became
very, very concerned

467
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,542
and worried for my wife.

00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,246
There's something here

working behind the bar,

00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:12,036
so to say she's got a thick skin
was an understatement.

about this building,

00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:29,946
Holy ****

522
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,817
I'm trying to get
into his head,

523
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,152
and he doesn't like that.

524
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,590
AMY: Shadow people are all
about mind control,

525
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,257
so I decided to fight fire
with fire.

526
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,293
And what I ended up discovering

527
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,762
was that the shadow man
was a phony.

528
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:50,001
So this man isn't actually
a shadow person?

529
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,167
No.

530
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,303
He's a dead person,

531
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:58,176
but he looks like
a shadow person.

532
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:02,312
He does follow people.

533
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,048
He's, like, stalking them.

534
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,784
He would like them to die.

535
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:11,756
STEVE:
In addition to housing one of
Columbus' oldest restaurants,

536
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,625
the building also had several
business offices.

537
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,128
So, I decided to knock
on a few doors,

538
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,994
and what I wind up finding out

539
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,700
was that the things upstairs
were even worse.

540
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,406
Did you ever
experience anything?

541
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,173
I was downstairs
in the conference room,

542
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,579
and all of a sudden I could
feel, like, a burn on my arm.

543
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,215
And when I pulled up
my sleeve,

544
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,817
you can see the scar
on my arm.

545
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,386
Looks like scratch marks.

546
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,289
So, is there anything else?

547
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:46,455
There's a young girl.

548
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,026
I feel like she's, like,
trying to get my attention.

549
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,395
It's almost like
you can hear her,

550
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,728
and she's, like,
really sad.

551
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:56,333
But I feel like she died
a very tragic, sad death.

552
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,339
AMY:
There's a lot of sadness.

553
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:08,310
[ Whispering ]
I don't like it back here.

554
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:12,182
[ Normal voice ] There's
something very bad up here.

555
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:16,020
There's quite a few of 'em
he's got trapped up in there.

556
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,754
A few of what?

557
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,323
[ Whispering ] People.

558
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,227
[ Normal voice ] They're
all crying in the corner.

559
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:28,065
He says, "Don't pay attention
to the ****

560
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,465
crying in the ****
corner."

561
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,868
Can you take me through
what happened?

562
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,301
NARRATOR: Next...

563
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:33,704
WOMAN: Within two minutes,
he's dead on the street.

564
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,107
NARRATOR:...Steve unearths
a grisly murder.

565
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,675
Would she have
gotten hung?

566
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:53,622
STEVE: Without question,

567
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,442
the Jury Room
had a colorful past,

568
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,286
and years of rumors made it hard

569
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:59,061
to distinguish fact
from fiction.

570
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,382
But there was one lead
I couldn't ignore.

571
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,668
At one time,
the building was a bordello,

572
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:04,901
and a confrontation

573
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,072
between one of the prostitutes,
Frances Miller,

574
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,507
and a potential john
ended in bloodshed.

575
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,417
Can you take me
through what happened?

576
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,018
It's the end
of March, 1859.

577
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,339
3 guys in their 20s,
friends, meet up.

578
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:27,590
They've been drinking
way too much,

579
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,360
and they're gonna go off
to the bordello.

580
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,964
There's dark things
coming up from the ground,

581
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,998
from the floor.

582
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,769
There's these men that are
coming up from the floor.

583
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,139
They're trying to come up
from the floor.

584
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,492
You have these
intoxicated young men,

585
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,775
which one of them,
Paulus Ruprecht,

586
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,546
he's definitely gonna get
his way into the bordello,

587
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:51,148
even though
it's past midnight.

588
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,649
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

589
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:54,686
What's wrong?

590
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,157
People are yelling.

591
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,294
Now, what
about Frances Miller?

592
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,361
So, it's not unusual
to think

593
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,498
that she has to take the matter
into her own hands,

594
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,534
pick up a gun,
and scare him off at least.

595
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:14,704
AMY:
There's blood on the floor.

596
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,207
Why is there blood
on the floor?

597
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,643
Because there was
this murder.

598
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,745
She turns him away.

599
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,498
Then he says, "I'm gonna kick
down the door."

600
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,217
And at that point,
she's definitely threatened,

601
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,550
and she shoots him,

602
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,121
And within two minutes
he's dead on the street.

603
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,226
He's like,
"Well, now you've got blood

604
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,312
on your hands, too ****"

605
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:39,329
STEVE: By most accounts,

606
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,531
Frances Miller's actions
were justified,

607
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,668
and many women in her situation
might have done the same thing.

608
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,902
But back in those days,

609
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,773
women in her line of work
had no rights whatsoever.

610
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,273
And according to a local author,

611
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,510
the case against Frances
ruined her life.

612
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,454
This Frances Miller trial,
what can you tell me about it?

613
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:09,694
Well, uh, I can tell you that it
started in the mayor's court.

614
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:12,861
Lorenzo English.
He was mayor of Columbus.

615
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:18,168
And he presided in mayor's court
over the witness testimony.

616
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,371
And then transferred it
to the common pleas court.

617
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,404
Okay.

618
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,473
What was her defense
in the case?

619
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:28,979
Well, her defense is that Paulus
was banging down the door

620
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,380
and threatened
to kick it down

621
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,282
and enter her bordello
establishment.

622
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:36,487
So her claim was
self-defense to shoot the guy.

623
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,120
And what winded up
happening?

624
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:41,591
Well, uh, she was tried
for first-degree murder.

625
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,362
And, um, she was convicted
of manslaughter

626
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:47,529
and sentenced to 11 years
in prison.

627
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,900
Now, had this guy, English,
done her trial,

628
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,434
would she have gotten hung?

629
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,455
Mayor English
was very, very strict

630
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,617
and a very, very
religious man,

631
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,433
It's my belief
that he would have

632
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:03,214
really thrown the book
at this woman.

633
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:10,188
The shadow man,
he's really pretty powerful.

634
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:14,225
Religious man, very.

635
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,661
Oh, I'm just getting
bits and pieces.

636
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:23,067
Huh?

637
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,604
He doesn't want me
to get into his mind.

638
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,338
Aah.

639
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,940
AMY: Even though
I'd already proven

640
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,444
that I could see through
his shadow person disguise,

641
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,312
the dead man continued
to try and block

642
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,847
my attempts to connect with him.

643
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,514
But once I broke through,

644
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,619
what he showed me
was absolutely disturbing.

645
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,321
AMY: Somebody's saying,

646
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,959
"And they deserve
to be punished,

647
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,525
"because...

648
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,300
"They were all, uh,
"evil, uh,

649
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,468
"doing very bad things,

650
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:03,674
uh, like,
against, uh, God."

651
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,043
Is he, like, the threat?

652
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,713
Yeah, I mean,
he can hurt you.

653
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,412
He hurt me. Yeah.

654
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:13,382
I think he can do that
to others. Yeah.

655
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,951
Do you think he wants
to kill the living here?

656
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,321
Yes.

657
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,890
NARRATOR: Next...

658
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,010
I saw him
coughing up blood.

659
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,061
...the shocking reveal...

660
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,098
There's a female
that he wants to kill.

661
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,131
...and the clients...

662
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,166
We wanted him out of here.

663
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,920
NARRATOR:
...struggle for survival.

664
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,604
I cast you out,
unclean spirit,

665
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,241
along with every satanic power
of the enemy.

666
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,096
STEVE: This is Harold
and Elizabeth.

667
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,865
They bought the place
a few years ago,

668
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,633
and they've had trouble
ever since.

669
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,134
Going into the reveal,

670
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:08,072
we knew that Amy
was gonna find something,

671
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,838
but what we did hear from her

672
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:12,910
was much more than we
would have ever imagined.

673
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,509
STEVE: This is Brenda,

674
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:17,214
and she had a pretty frightening
incident happen to her.

675
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:20,315
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

676
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,419
AMY: The first person
that I encountered

677
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,590
was a very, very sad,
lost woman.

678
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,727
She was hysterical,
um, crying.

679
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,060
Wow.

680
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:34,131
I sense her.
I don't see her.

681
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,298
She's just very sad,

682
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,335
and she died
a very tragic death.

683
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,136
Well, back in the 1850s

684
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,307
there was a bordello
run out of the building.

685
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,276
The woman that ran
the bordello here,

686
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,009
her name was Frances Miller.

687
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,344
She shot and killed a young man

688
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:52,850
who was attempting
to get into the bordello.

689
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,251
She was sentenced to 11 years,

690
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,586
came out, and her life
was basically destroyed.

691
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:01,291
Could that sad woman you
encountered be Frances miler?

692
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,725
Yes.

693
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,729
ELIZABETH: As a fellow
female business owner,

694
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:09,732
I can absolutely empathize with
Frances Miller, why that happened.

695
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,100
She was defending her staff.

696
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,501
She was defending her business.

697
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,572
So the next conscious
entity that I encountered,

698
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,958
he's in his 20s.

699
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:20,275
He is a braggart.

700
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,213
He hates
the depressed woman.

701
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,116
I saw him
coughing up blood.

702
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,752
Well, it sounds like the guy
that Frances Miller murdered.

703
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,089
He was 26 years old.
His name was Paulus Ruprecht.

704
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:35,392
He was treating the women
like they were animals.

705
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,127
He also has an issue
with the living,

706
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:40,596
because he wants the place
for himself.

707
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,784
Right now I know
that he can touch and push.

708
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,938
Back towards that office
I was actually pushed

709
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:49,340
pretty -- pretty violently.

710
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,673
Definitely a forceful push.

711
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,177
He's, like,
at the end of his rope

712
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,647
with the other
dead people here.

713
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:00,415
Will this guy get worse?

714
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,686
Oh, yeah.
He wants to trash the place.

715
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,390
ELIZABETH: My whole life, I've
waited on people like Paulus,

716
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,658
just an obnoxious,
drunken bar customer,

717
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,144
and I didn't want him
in my bar,

718
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:11,594
and I certainly didn't want him

719
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,948
harassing the women
who worked here.

720
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,593
This is my business,
and I built it up,

721
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:19,203
and this man wants
to destroy it -- no way.

722
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:26,577
So, the next entity
I see is this shadow person.

723
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:29,145
But it's actually
a dead person

724
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,015
who is projecting that image
around him.

725
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,020
He was an extremely
powerful person.

726
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,773
He was<i> very</i> religious.

727
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:41,768
He felt the people
who were here

728
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,694
were doing things
against God.

729
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:48,399
There was a mayor here,
Lorenzo English.

730
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,567
He was very religious
and rigid.

731
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,071
He presided over
the witness testimony

732
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,671
for the case
for Frances Miller.

733
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,443
Do you think the shadow being
is this guy Lorenzo?

734
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,609
Yes, I do.

735
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:03,346
Why would he be here,
though?

736
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,033
He didn't get to do what
he wanted to do to her in life.

737
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:10,720
ELIZABETH: We didn't know why
Lorenzo English would be here,

738
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,557
but we knew that our staff
had seen a shadow person

739
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,526
and we knew that
he was bothering them.

740
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,460
And then the fact
that Amy saw him

741
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,031
made us certain that we wanted
him out of here.

742
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,634
I was, um, finishing up
some paperwork,

743
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,202
and all of a sudden
I felt this, like,

744
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:26,602
burn go down my arm.

745
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,673
STEVE: She still has
the scarring from it.

746
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,940
Oh, my God.

747
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,578
I think he probably did
harm you.

748
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,447
- This guy?
- Yeah.

749
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,118
There's a male
that he wants to harm,

750
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,756
but there's a female
that he wants to kill.

751
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,627
So I did something a little bit
different with my sketch.

752
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,698
I sketched him
attacking me.

753
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:58,868
AMY: He'd probably be
about 6'3".

754
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,122
You can see, like,
his arms,

755
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:05,376
and there's bricks
on the floor.

756
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,278
STEVE:
Take a look at this.

757
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,751
ELIZABETH:
He's grabbing at you.

758
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,519
AMY:
What I wanted to show

759
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,022
is what he's capable of doing,
like causing pain.

760
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:25,062
HAROLD: Seeing the shadow figure
attacking Amy in the drawing

761
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:28,063
really brought home
that this force

762
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,933
could do that to my wife
and to my staff.

763
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,567
That was scary.

764
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:36,205
STEVE: Is there any way
that Harold and Elizabeth

765
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,908
can save the restaurant
and save lives?

766
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,680
I was initially concerned
about the shadow man,

767
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,214
because he does have
a lot of power.

768
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:48,316
But he's just a dead guy,

769
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:54,656
so with him, his main weakness
is his religion.

770
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,394
Using the religion is
bringing in a man of the cloth

771
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,731
to do a blessing
of the entire location.

772
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,364
Once you do this,

773
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:05,134
there will be no dead
that can enter this place

774
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:06,569
and no dead that remain.

775
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,439
And you guys
are definitely gonna do this?

776
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:26,056
HAROLD: While I'm not
particularly religious,

777
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,689
Amy's the expert.

778
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:31,194
When she told us that a priest
would get rid of the spirits,

779
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,696
we trusted her.

780
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,868
ELIZABETH:
We had to come in late at night

781
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,401
with the priest to face this,

782
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,273
and we were frightened,
but we knew we had to do it.

783
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:43,939
PRIEST:
I arrived at the restaurant

784
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,845
and began the normal routines
of a blessing for a building.

785
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,545
Heavenly Father,

786
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,514
we ask for your blessings
on all those who enter the door

787
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:56,619
in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

788
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,686
Didn't feel bad at all,

789
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,654
but when I went
into the basement,

790
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:02,426
there was a feeling
of a heavy presence,

791
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,392
had a very dark tone to it.

792
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:08,198
ELIZABETH: It got really cold,
and the lights were flickering.

793
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,969
It was unlike anything else I've
ever felt in this restaurant.

794
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:13,535
PRIEST: At that point,

795
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,273
I felt it necessary to move
from just a simple blessing

796
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,542
to an exorcism.

797
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,445
I cast you out,
unclean spirit,

798
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,748
along with every satanic power
of the enemy.

799
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,815
ELIZABETH:
The priest's energy changed.

800
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,054
Be gone and stay away far
from this creature of God.

801
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,720
He became more aggressive.

802
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:37,094
The blood of the martyrs of all
holy men and women command you,

803
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:38,894
"Be gone, accursed dragon."

804
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,998
ELIZABETH: There's more prayers.
There's more holy water.

805
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,297
It was scary.

806
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,366
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

807
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,704
and the Holy Spirit,
amen.

808
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,481
When everything was finished
and things settled down,

809
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:01,250
we finally all felt
just at peace.

810
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,819
HAROLD: Now things have gotten
much better.

811
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,589
We haven't had
any more experiences here,

812
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:11,662
and the future looks bright
for the Jury Room.

813
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:15,598
AMY: When dealing
with powerful entities,

814
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,101
sometimes the only way
to get rid of them

815
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,768
is by taking extreme measures.

816
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,839
But now that the sins of
the past have been absolved,

817
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,960
Harold and Elizabeth should take
comfort in knowing

818
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:29,046
that their customers and staff
have nothing to fear.
