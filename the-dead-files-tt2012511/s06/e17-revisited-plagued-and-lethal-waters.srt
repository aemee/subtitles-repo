1
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:07,505
There is a lot of death.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,276
NARRATOR: Tonight on
"Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,876
You can feel the fear.

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,879
...a return to Pennsylvania...

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,881
I'm gonna square off with that
son of a **** on his own.

6
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,684
He wants a piece of something?
Come and **** me.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,883
...for a second look

8
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,022
at two of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

9
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:23,456
So, basically,
they suffocated to death.

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,656
New information.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,093
We knew it was bad,
but we didn't know how bad.

12
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,959
NARRATOR:
Startling revelations.

13
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:32,298
And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?"

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,799
NARRATOR: First, in Cressona...

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,736
How do you protect them
against something like that?

16
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,469
...a dangerous presence...

17
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,806
I think the devil
is down here.

18
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,874
...stalks a family.

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,077
He said, "I'll see you soon.
I can't wait."

20
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,277
NARRATOR: Then...

21
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,646
You can feel
that you're being watched.

22
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,300
...we travel back
to nearby Cambridge Springs...

23
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,919
This is going to be
a difficult walk for me.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,887
NARRATOR:...where
a hotel's troubled past...

25
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,425
I think that there were
a lot of ill people here.

26
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,493
NARRATOR:
...could seal its fate.

27
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:04,830
Nobody wants to go into a hotel
that they don't feel safe.

28
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,698
Did they listen to Amy...

29
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,185
STEVE: Do you think
they'll be okay?

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,638
...or does the nightmare
continue?

31
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,876
Take the negative energy
and just go away.

32
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,611
It's time for you to leave.

33
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,214
It's really bad in here.

34
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,517
My name is Amy Allan.

35
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,786
Something is not right.

36
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,352
I see dead people.

37
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:30,690
This person might have been
a serial killer.

38
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,358
I speak to dead people.

39
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,991
You get those chills.

40
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:35,459
And they speak to me.

41
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:37,929
He is darkness.
He is evil.

42
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,000
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

43
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,801
I think she broke her neck.

44
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,303
I rely on my partner.

45
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,771
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

46
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,340
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

47
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,807
You telling me the truth?

48
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,079
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

49
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,547
I think the devil
is down here.

50
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,932
It's my job to reveal them.

51
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,842
Who the hell would do this?

52
00:01:57,877 --> 00:01:59,683
But Steve and I never speak...

53
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,787
We never communicate
during an investigation.

54
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,139
...until the very end.

55
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,422
Who's he looking to kill?

56
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,625
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

57
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,794
You need to get out of here
right now.

58
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,926
Or time to get out.

59
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,530
It was, like, endless darkness.

60
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,644
STEVE: As soon as I heard

61
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,848
that two veterans
in Cressona, Pennsylvania,

62
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,314
needed our help,

63
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,684
I knew the situation
had already gotten out of hand.

64
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,419
Having served myself,

65
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,856
I know you never call for backup
unless you absolutely have to.

66
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,859
By the time we got there,
the battle was in full swing,

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,428
and I was just hoping
we weren't too late.

68
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,466
STEVE: Now, Randy, I understand
you and your fiancée, Angela,

69
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,403
have got some pretty serious
things going on here.

70
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:52,304
There's apparitions.
There's shadows.

71
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,373
There's been things moved

72
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,275
that I know
nobody has touched.

73
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,043
RANDY:
It was getting to the point

74
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,614
where it was causing animosity
between myself and Angela.

75
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,918
There's constant fighting.
There's constant tension.

76
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,753
It was just getting
worse and worse.

77
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,320
Who lives in the house?

78
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,790
Myself, Angela,
my two daughters,

79
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,290
and my stepson.

80
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,027
Are they frightened
to be in the house?

81
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,428
Samantha is.

82
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,197
Samantha actually lived here
with me last year

83
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,083
and moved out
because she's so afraid.

84
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,899
- That's got to be heartbreaking
for you. - It is.

85
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,501
That's my little girl.

86
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,773
It's hard to be a father
and protect your children

87
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,106
when you can't --
how do you protect them

88
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,440
against
something like that?

89
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,310
Did you guys ever consider
moving out of here?

90
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,413
It's not an option.

91
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,192
AMY: Without question,

92
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:51,130
this was one of the worst walks
I've ever done.

93
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,397
The physical impact
lasted for days

94
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:57,170
and made every step of the
investigation almost unbearable.

95
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:02,692
There's this really tall,
crazy guy.

96
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:08,180
He has, like,
a long cape and a hat.

97
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,453
He is very excited
for us to be here tonight

98
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,755
because he thinks
he's all that,

99
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,893
as far as being able
to mess with people

100
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,695
and scare them.

101
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,548
He said, "I'll see you soon.
I can't wait."

102
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,401
Like, "You'll know
when you get there,"

103
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,271
you know, "what I'm all about."

104
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,441
STEVE: This is
your youngest daughter's?

105
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,507
RANDY: Yes.

106
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,210
She had described to me
a large, dark figure

107
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,046
with a cape
and a hook hand.

108
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,581
She won't even go in the closet
by herself.

109
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,052
That's scary for anybody,
let alone an 8-year-old.

110
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,488
The way I understand it,
she sees it pretty often.

111
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,823
Something or someone
was in Samantha's room.

112
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,744
And we knew it was bad,
but we didn't know how bad.

113
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,606
And I actually wasn't sure
if I could protect the home.

114
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,433
I don't even know the kid,
and my heart's breaking for her.

115
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,304
If I think about it, I get
emotional. That's my daughter.

116
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,179
AMY: You can feel the fear
that these people feel.

117
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,447
He likes the closets.

118
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,752
He doesn't really care
for children.

119
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,020
They're easy mark.

120
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,854
Bottom line,

121
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,125
the tall man was simply a coward
who fed off the vulnerable.

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,491
And over the years,

123
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,227
this approach had only
made him stronger.

124
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:33,015
And now he was ready
for a new challenge -- me.

125
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,768
He's like, "Oh, I'm gonna
**** with your head

126
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,604
if you're gonna ****
with my head."

127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,705
MATTHEW:
And what is he doing?

128
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,709
He's just making me dizzy
and feel like I want to vomit.

129
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,245
I feel like someone's
pushing my throat in.

130
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,098
Right here.

131
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,875
Like that.

132
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,617
Really hard.

133
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,722
STEVE: It was clear the activity
was hitting Randy pretty hard,

134
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,957
but what his fiancée witnessed
in the basement

135
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,495
was enough to make anyone uneasy
in their own house.

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,169
You all right?

137
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,873
What are you feeling
when you come down here?

138
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,706
I just feel evil.

139
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,478
One night, I heard banging
and growling and scratching

140
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,964
coming from
the basement door.

141
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,241
What do you think's
down here?

142
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:25,449
I think
the devil is down here.

143
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,986
I was concerned
that this evil entity

144
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,921
was going to hurt the children,

145
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,425
and I just wanted
to get rid of it.

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,031
One of the things that I feel
that may be behind it all

147
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,231
is my mother.

148
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,118
My mother passed away
in '98.

149
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,912
She died
of bone-marrow cancer.

150
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,637
STEVE: Being a veteran myself,

151
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,575
I knew I'd have a lot in common
with these clients.

152
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,709
But what Angela shared with me
next

153
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,413
hit home in a way
I just didn't see coming.

154
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,615
I had some issues
with my mother.

155
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,753
We'd try to make amends,
but it didn't happen.

156
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,353
I feel tremendous guilt.

157
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:06,392
I absolutely understand
what you're talking about.

158
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,260
Same thing happened to me
with my father.

159
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,594
I didn't get
to say goodbye.

160
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,464
We had an argument
the night he died.

161
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,133
[ Sniffles ]

162
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,836
I still have guilt
about it.

163
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,072
And if I can
do that night over...

164
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,942
[snaps fingers] I'd do
that night over in a minute.

165
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,276
Unfortunately,
before she died,

166
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,214
we never had a chance
to say goodbye to each other,

167
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,419
so I do believe
that my mother is here.

168
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,990
AMY: I want to say
that this lady

169
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,995
is related to the people
in the house now.

170
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,866
She keeps saying
that she's very sorry

171
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,169
about everything
that's happened.

172
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,309
Oh, my God.

173
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,396
Something about cancer.

174
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,557
I think she died from it.

175
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,683
Do you know
when this was?

176
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,350
Late '90s.

177
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:10,289
She might be death
come to this house.

178
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,825
She's coming
to take the lady.

179
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,158
NARRATOR: Next...

180
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,197
Cressona was absolutely hammered
with death.

181
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,364
...evil is exposed.

182
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,219
He does not want anybody to know
who he is.

183
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,040
NARRATOR: And,
in our second investigation...

184
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,143
The lights flickered,
doors slammed.

185
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,713
...death lurks
beneath the surface.

186
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,248
It was agony --
absolutely just agony.

187
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,793
STEVE:
When Cressona was first settled,

188
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,114
the construction of the railroad
helped put it on the map.

189
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,401
And back then, many of those
workers lived in Randy's house.

190
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,088
Obviously, a life
of manual labor isn't easy,

191
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,774
and a local historian
told me about one man

192
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,010
who only made things worse.

193
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:12,118
John Chapman Cresson
was the founder of Cressona.

194
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,819
His contemporaries
describe him

195
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,454
as quite a tall man.

196
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,824
He was a very shrewd
businessman.

197
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,728
STEVE: And how's it go
from the land into a town?

198
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,062
What John Cresson did

199
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,566
is he broke the land up
into individual plots

200
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,886
and had homes built
on the plots.

201
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,136
He sold them
to the railroad workers.

202
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,474
So, on one hand, he was
putting money into their pocket,

203
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,376
and on the other hand,
taking it out.

204
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,580
So, it sounds like
this guy's kind of ruthless.

205
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,183
He was.

206
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,089
AMY: I think that this is
the tall, creepy guy.

207
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:56,461
He does not want anybody to know
who he is.

208
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,398
Do you know how he looked
in life?

209
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,300
He had, like,
kind of a slender face,

210
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:06,471
a kind of a hook nose,
dark eyes.

211
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,839
He's saying, "Stop, stop,"

212
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,077
'cause I'm, like, trying
to get into his head.

213
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,944
Instead of attacking me,

214
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,447
the tall man
started to resist me.

215
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,117
That's how I knew
he had something to hide.

216
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,019
And, in the end, I was right.

217
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,624
I think he sells
a variety of merchandise.

218
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:29,194
And I know
he was a very, very bad person.

219
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,670
STEVE: In 1918, the Spanish Flu
struck the town of Cressona,

220
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,040
and the only doctor there
lived in Randy's house.

221
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,608
I was about to find out

222
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,479
that doctor's work
followed him home.

223
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,759
Can you tell me anything
about Dr. Gray?

224
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,128
He was
the only doctor in Cressona

225
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,662
during the Spanish Flu,

226
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:08,300
and his clinic and his residence
were in the same building.

227
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,903
Okay, so did he practice out
of the house I'm investigating?

228
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:12,969
Yes.

229
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,738
How bad did Cressona get hit?

230
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:17,809
Cressona was absolutely hammered
with death.

231
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,711
Wow.

232
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,543
Yeah.

233
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,480
You would feel
like your chest

234
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,347
was being compressed
or squeezed.

235
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,782
So, basically,
they suffocated to death.

236
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,216
Yes.

237
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,954
They would have been
convalescing in his house

238
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:29,988
and dying there.

239
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,490
Wow.

240
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,531
AMY: It's ridiculous
how many dead people are here.

241
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,840
There's, like, illness in here.

242
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,542
Oh, my God, it's bad.

243
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,477
This had already been
a difficult walk,

244
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:58,449
and now a mob of sick
dead people were coming at me.

245
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,387
I wanted to help them all,
but it was just too much.

246
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,587
Oh, God.

247
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,026
I can't breathe again.

248
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:12,264
I feel **** terrible.

249
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,134
NARRATOR: Coming up...

250
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,068
I want this guy.

251
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,370
I'm gonna get this guy.

252
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,240
...what happened
after the investigation?

253
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:26,212
Ye who are unwelcome
are to leave.

254
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,536
STEVE: Amy, I want you to meet
Angela and Randy.

255
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,571
I've never met a medium before,

256
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,040
so I was a little bit
apprehensive.

257
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,378
I was very nervous of that, and
we had seen something evil here.

258
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,846
The activity in this house
is so intense

259
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,416
that it's literally
ripping their family apart.

260
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:10,304
AMY: There were just
so many dead people,

261
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,233
and they were all trying
to talk at once.

262
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:16,127
Pretty much every room upstairs
made me sick.

263
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,064
Some of the symptoms
I felt that night

264
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,266
was dizziness, vomiting.

265
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,299
- That's why you sound sick?
- Yeah.

266
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,034
That's interesting.

267
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,204
Back in 1918,
the Spanish Flu hit here.

268
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,710
Approximately 20% of the town
died from this flu.

269
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,430
James Gray,
the guy that lived here,

270
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,081
happened to be
the only doctor in town.

271
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,685
And he treated a lot
of those patients
right here in this home,

272
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,654
where a lot of them
probably passed away.

273
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,253
Oh, my God.

274
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,858
I went through exactly
what you just described

275
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,725
on many occasions.

276
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,126
Yeah,
that makes sense.

277
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,528
The residual here
is very thick.

278
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,598
I didn't know how many people
have died in this house,

279
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,903
and here we find out that it was
giving me the same symptoms.

280
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,336
It blew me away.

281
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,807
I mean, that's not something
you hear every day.

282
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,610
STEVE: So, how did the rest
of the walk go?

283
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,529
This guy shows up.

284
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,379
He was extremely tall,

285
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:13,117
had a hat on, cape --
shadowy.

286
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,337
He's very creepy,
very powerful.

287
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,522
I know he bought
and sold things.

288
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:24,763
And I know he had a hook nose
and dark eyes.

289
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,631
Really?

290
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,430
Yeah.

291
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,867
Kind of reminds me of somebody
who's important to this town.

292
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,469
It turns out it's a guy
named John Chapman Cresson,

293
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,970
hence Cressona.

294
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,174
This guy ran the railroad here,
and he had some shady dealings.

295
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,275
If you look at his nose,

296
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,445
he's got this hook nose
that she had...

297
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:44,116
Interesting.

298
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,337
I did do a sketch
of the man.

299
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:53,025
He had a long,
thin, pointy nose.

300
00:14:54,826 --> 00:15:00,032
His eyes are rounded on top,
straight at the bottom.

301
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,669
Wow.

302
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,640
Take a look at that.

303
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,412
Wow, that's freaky.

304
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,113
It looks spot-on to me.

305
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,316
So, basically,
the guy that built Cressona

306
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,784
is hanging out
in our house.

307
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,819
Yes.

308
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,123
And I think he's<i> an</i> evil
presence in your house.

309
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,360
He likes
to mess with people.

310
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,060
Wonderful.

311
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,332
RANDY:
I wasn't very happy to hear
that there's something evil here

312
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,099
and it's scaring everybody.

313
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,035
I was thinking, "Oh, my God.
We can't move.

314
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,601
What are we gonna do?"

315
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:42,624
The other thing that I got
was he hates kids.

316
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,612
And then I saw
one of the things he was doing,

317
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,146
which I thought
was very disturbing,

318
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,015
and I did sketch it.

319
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,814
- Where did you see this?
- This.

320
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,787
- Oh, so it's in Samantha's room.
- Samantha's room.

321
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,228
I don't even know
if I want to show this to you.

322
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,138
That's the closet.

323
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,212
I want this guy.

324
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,650
I'm gonna get this guy.

325
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,300
RANDY:
When I saw that sketch of John
Cresson standing over Sammy,

326
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,436
I just wanted to kill him.

327
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,569
I wanted revenge.

328
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,006
And when I meet him
in another afterlife,

329
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,007
it's gonna be me and him.

330
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,409
That John Cresson ****

331
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,411
him and I are gonna have
some dealings.

332
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:55,614
I'm gonna sit down,
and I'm gonna square off

333
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,280
with that son of a ****
on his own.

334
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,683
He wants a piece of something,
come and **** me.

335
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,288
STEVE: All of our clients handle
our findings in different ways,

336
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,856
and Randy's angry reaction
made me understand

337
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,595
just how hard he was willing to
fight to protect his family.

338
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,038
I hate to even ask this
right now,

339
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,040
but was there anything else
you saw?

340
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,473
I saw a lady,

341
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,342
and I got
that she might have been

342
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,346
a relative of someone
who lives here...

343
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,117
...that she died of cancer
in the late '90s.

344
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,419
Oh, my God.

345
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,489
Her mother
died of cancer.

346
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:43,994
She felt guilty.

347
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,696
She's back to take the woman
of the house.

348
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,934
Death was gonna come
to the house, but she came,

349
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,703
for her
to take death's place

350
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,437
so that she'll be
comfortable.

351
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,804
Whoa.

352
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:57,476
When Amy said that my mom
was always going to be there,

353
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,161
that really freaked me out.

354
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,812
But it did give me comfort

355
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,949
knowing that she felt guilty
for not making amends with me.

356
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,419
Well, listen,
it's been a tough night,

357
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,756
and I think you guys got a lot
more than you bargained for.

358
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,623
But the reason you called us

359
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,658
is to see if you and your family
can live here peacefully

360
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,678
and straighten out
what the hell you got going on.

361
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,698
If it's at all within
your means, I would move.

362
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,432
We went through everything
we went through so far.

363
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,403
I'm not gonna just roll over
and say, "Go ahead and take it."

364
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,838
No, I'm fighting
for what's mine.

365
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,203
They're getting
the hell out.

366
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,672
Is there anything else
they can do?

367
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,444
Because it seems to be
encompassing the town,

368
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,111
you need
to build your fortress.

369
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:38,115
First, get bags of salt,

370
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,186
and go around
the entire property line.

371
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,725
Then, with a holy person --
They're gonna bless the house.

372
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,327
And after they're done
blessing each room,

373
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,160
sprinkle brimstone.

374
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,231
It'll get rid of the dead people
here.

375
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,500
What about her mom?

376
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,699
That woman will stay.

377
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,819
That process
cannot stop.

378
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,613
It's natural, organic.

379
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,337
Now, I'm gonna ask you,

380
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:04,276
are you gonna
follow Amy's advice?

381
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,224
RANDY:
After the investigation,

382
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,693
I was very concerned
for my family's safety,

383
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:27,232
and I just wanted
to move forward with our lives.

384
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,908
First, I had to spread
a salt line around the property

385
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,140
for protection

386
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,044
and to help clear
residual energy

387
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,047
that was already here.

388
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,685
SHAMAN:
I call the spirits and helpers
of the northwest

389
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,120
to come.

390
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,190
Ye who are unwelcome
are to leave.

391
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,190
RANDY:
When the shaman arrived,

392
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,293
she was kind of like
a guiding spirit.

393
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,694
I banish
that which is unclean.

394
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:03,168
She had burned sage
from the attic to the basement,

395
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,136
cleansing the house.

396
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,239
She could feel John Cresson
in Samantha's room,

397
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,310
and the shaman proceeded
to do chanting and drumming

398
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,413
to push the negativity
out the doorway.

399
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,683
[ Chanting ]

400
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:25,422
Yee-ooh!

401
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,724
The last step
was the fire ceremony

402
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,860
to bring peace and serenity
to the whole property.

403
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,698
Let it be known that those
who are unclean are not welcome.

404
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,868
You are not
to bother this family.

405
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,669
It was pretty powerful.

406
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,307
I ask you now
to bless this family, this land

407
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,774
and help them
now and always.

408
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,580
Let there be love and happiness
and protection of this house.

409
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,184
Purify this house, this land.
Protect it now and always.

410
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,396
After the ceremony, there has
been virtually no activity.

411
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,264
Samantha is not afraid
to be in her own bedroom,

412
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,332
and me and Angela feel safer.

413
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,235
We're gonna be maintaining
and blessing

414
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,191
to make sure
no evil can penetrate the house.

415
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:20,112
RANDY: So, I hope what we did
is gonna last.

416
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,001
It's been hard here.

417
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,387
It's been real hard.

418
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:35,358
AMY: When I first arrived,

419
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:38,312
I was concerned for anyone
who lived in this house.

420
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:41,232
But after meeting Randy
and seeing his determination,

421
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,899
I'm confident
that he'll continue

422
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,370
to do whatever it takes
to protect his family.

423
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:01,420
STEVE:
As a business owner, a bad
reputation can ruin everything.

424
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,555
And that's exactly what happened
to our clients

425
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,922
in Cambridge Springs,
Pennsylvania.

426
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,393
Word had spread that
the Riverside Inn was haunted,

427
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,762
and they were on the verge
of shutting down.

428
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,262
But Amy and I were determined

429
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,499
to make sure
that wasn't gonna happen.

430
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,503
STEVE: Brenda?

431
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,437
BRENDA: Yes.

432
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,072
How long
you owned this place?

433
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,341
This is the beginning
of our fourth year.

434
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,745
So, at what point did you
realize you have a problem here?

435
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,180
Well, after we talked to
some of the employees,

436
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,281
I realized
that we had a couple

437
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,385
that were afraid to work
in the dish room by themselves.

438
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,254
Talking to different customers,
I realized

439
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,622
that there are
quite a few things.

440
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,277
BRENDA:
It was starting to escalate,

441
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,294
and we didn't even know
what to do.

442
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,998
When you know that there's
something going on at your hotel

443
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,598
that you have no control over --

444
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,802
I was close to tears
most of the time.

445
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,269
- Is it hurting business?
- Absolutely.

446
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,872
I think there are people
that really would be afraid

447
00:22:55,907 --> 00:23:00,477
to come and stay at a place
that they think is "haunted."

448
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,581
And you got how much savings
invested in this place?

449
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,147
Everything.

450
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,716
So, for you to shut it down
would --

451
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,151
I'd go bankrupt.

452
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,637
This is going to be
a difficult walk for me.

453
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,042
I'm still amazed that I was able
to make it through the night.

454
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,976
The location was huge,

455
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,213
and the activity
was overwhelming.

456
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:39,015
I feel dizzy and...

457
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,336
confused -- very confused.

458
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,622
There's a lot of death.

459
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:54,566
Someone did suffer
major head trauma here.

460
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,571
It was agony --
absolutely just agony.

461
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,974
Mm.

462
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,645
They are plotting and planning
in here.

463
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,911
NARRATOR: Next...

464
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:12,082
It would destroy
my reason for living.

465
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,885
...lives are caught
in the crossfire.

466
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,724
There's a lot of inner conflict
with the dead people here.

467
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,638
STEVE: As I walked around
the Riverside Inn,

468
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,239
our client, Brenda,
made it clear

469
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,672
that her main concern

470
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:39,542
was the safety of her customers
and employees.

471
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,447
But it was her own experience
that really got my attention.

472
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,114
Why'd you
bring me in here?

473
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,817
This is where,
at one point in time,

474
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,183
my husband and I came up,

475
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:48,903
and the lights flickered,
doors slammed,

476
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:50,553
and we were the only people
in the hotel.

477
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:52,356
Okay, did the breaker go
or something like that?

478
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,890
Nope. Nope.
Not at all.

479
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,361
BRENDA: There are definitely
certain areas in the hotel

480
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,896
that are more prone to activity,

481
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,201
and nobody really cares to go
in there if they don't have to.

482
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,304
Anything else
going on up here?

483
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,337
Well,
I always feel watched.

484
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,041
Just a general feeling
of eyes being on you.

485
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,842
Do you feel that way now?

486
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,310
I always have that feeling

487
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,448
that there's always
somebody watching me.

488
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:26,157
There's a lot of inner conflict
with the dead people here.

489
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:31,362
I'd say there's about three
cliques of dead people here.

490
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,999
And they fight a lot.

491
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,804
The dead here
had banded together

492
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,404
into three distinct groups --

493
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,542
old people, young adults,
and juvenile delinquents.

494
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,944
Each group
presented its own threat,

495
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,411
but there was one entity

496
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,014
that none of them
would dare mess with.

497
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:53,851
There's this old man here
with a cane.

498
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,585
He's a very dominant presence.

499
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,025
And he beats the younger people
with his cane

500
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,692
when they fight.

501
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,231
The living actually
can hear or feel this.

502
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,000
It would be really scary
to them.

503
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:14,072
STEVE:
It was obvious to me that Brenda
wasn't managing her stress well,

504
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,239
and her husband
wasn't doing any better.

505
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,444
But somehow, he found the
strength to put on a brave face.

506
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,986
Larry, your wife said that
you've been experiencing stuff

507
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,321
down here
in the theater.

508
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:31,487
LARRY: Absolutely.

509
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:33,791
Mostly things disappearing
here.

510
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,025
Like what?

511
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,692
Props, shoes.

512
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:40,231
They disappear for two weeks,
and then they reappear.

513
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,166
LARRY: I was so concerned

514
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,621
because my wife spends nights
here alone.

515
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,900
If something ever happened
to Brenda,

516
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:53,109
it would destroy
my reason for living.

517
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,447
You sure it's nobody
borrowing this stuff
and bringing it back?

518
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:59,149
Positive,
because I have the key.

519
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,221
I personally had a costume
go missing backstage,

520
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:05,488
and three months later,

521
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,091
it appeared
at the front desk.

522
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,662
And nobody could explain
how it got there.

523
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:19,070
The younger people
are far more rambunctious

524
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,607
and angry
than the old people.

525
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,073
They get all pissy.

526
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:27,344
They work each other up,
and then they run amok.

527
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,498
So, to the living people,
it seems constant.

528
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,618
There's always something
that's been moved.

529
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:37,420
You can feel
that you're being watched.

530
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,756
In what way, though --
like, somebody's peeking
around the corner at you?

531
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,827
Like maybe just standing there,
watching.

532
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,096
It can be disturbing.

533
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:53,772
These are where the
juvenile delinquents hang out.

534
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:02,480
They're like little spies
around and watching people.

535
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,583
You know,
a little inappropriate behavior.

536
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,650
Like what?

537
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,253
Like shower watching

538
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,023
or people
going to the bathroom.

539
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,758
Of the three cliques,

540
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,994
the juvenile delinquents
were the hardest to figure out.

541
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,100
Yeah, what they were doing was
disgusting but mostly harmless.

542
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:27,172
Unfortunately, I sensed things
weren't going to stay that way.

543
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:33,077
They are plotting and planning
in here.

544
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,563
And I think
they're the bad seeds.

545
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,015
All right.
So, this was an accident?

546
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,348
NARRATOR: Next...

547
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,319
French Creek
has taken a lot of lives

548
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:42,620
up and down its length.

549
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,254
...no one is safe.

550
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:48,426
She's trying to get me
to go in the water.

551
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,174
STEVE: The one piece of history
I had on the Riverside Inn

552
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,707
was so bizarre

553
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,512
I was almost certain
it would lead to a dead end.

554
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,612
But after years
of working with Amy,

555
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,283
I knew it was just the type
of clue I had to chase down.

556
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,460
STEVE:
So, my client said

557
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,795
that the property
I'm investigating

558
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,366
might have been
a fountain-of-youth
type of a place.

559
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,533
It was.
Dr. John H. Gray.

560
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:33,370
He was the one who discovered
the mineral waters.

561
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,206
He was out probing,
looking for oil on his property.

562
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,208
He discovered not oil
but rather a spring.

563
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:42,312
So he had it tested,
found it was high in iron,

564
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,014
sodium, magnesium,
potassium,

565
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,801
so he starts prescribing
to the locals.

566
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,096
Okay. What kind of people
went to him?

567
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:52,411
A lot of these people
would have come

568
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:54,657
with pre-existing
medical conditions.

569
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,227
So, did anybody get cured
from this stuff?

570
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,628
Large amounts of magnesium

571
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,165
can actually lead
to serious issues

572
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,668
to the point of even death
for some.

573
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,591
AMY:
Something is not right here.

574
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:13,945
And there's, like,
this wetness...

575
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,081
like oil or water.

576
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:24,155
It caused the misfortunes.

577
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,660
And then I do hear
convalescent?

578
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:38,668
It seems like this place
did serve a lot of purpose.

579
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,203
What do you mean?

580
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,107
I literally see,
like, gurneys?

581
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,045
It seemed like
every time I turned around,

582
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,112
a new dead person would appear.

583
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,783
And each one
was sicker than the last.

584
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,785
[ Door creaks ]

585
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,058
I think that there were
a lot of ill people here.

586
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,893
[ Exhales deeply ]

587
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:03,859
You okay?

588
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,046
I just feel sick.

589
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,199
I'm a **** mess.

590
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,688
STEVE: Expanding my search
of the property,

591
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,940
I found an article
about a kid that drowned

592
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,408
right behind the hotel.

593
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,544
And after speaking to
a local author,

594
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,549
I learned that tragedy
was just one of many.

595
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,392
So, I came across
this kid that drowned

596
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,228
right here on the property
I'm investigating.

597
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,432
That happened
in August of 1979.

598
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,398
Okay.

599
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,769
Young man's name
was Robert Griffith.

600
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:46,368
Here you go.

601
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,173
He was swimming with
some friends in the river here

602
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,506
and drowned.

603
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,208
All right.
So, this was an accident?

604
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,312
Yeah, and they were kind of
common in French Creek,

605
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:57,914
as a matter of fact.

606
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,515
What do you mean
by common?

607
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,518
Well, there was a young man
who drowned in the river

608
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,554
almost in the same spot
the very next year.

609
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,573
His name
was Michael Catalano.

610
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,967
It was
similar circumstances.

611
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,292
Now, is the river
that bad?

612
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,396
French Creek
has taken a lot of lives

613
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,732
up and down its length.

614
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:23,140
There's some people
in the water.

615
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,808
They're bloated.

616
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,511
I think they're dead.

617
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,145
And there's a woman.

618
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,550
She likes to jump people.

619
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:35,017
She's, um...

620
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,654
trying to get me
to go in the water.

621
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,457
Can you describe it
at all?

622
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:43,811
She's in me...

623
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:46,364
was inside of me.

624
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,068
Right then, that dead woman
tried to jump me.

625
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,136
And as I struggled
to fight her off,

626
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,370
her intentions became clear.

627
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,375
She wants to make people
go in the water.

00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,077
NARRATOR: Next...

629
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,144
Oh, my gosh.

630
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,213
...dark secrets are exposed.

631
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,848
People might have
killed themselves doing it.

632
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,253
I could feel my heart racing.
I could hardly swallow.

633
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,387
NARRATOR:
Can this hotel be saved?

634
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,759
So, take the negative energy,
and just go away.

635
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:42,320
STEVE: Amy, I want you to meet
Larry and Brenda.

636
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,690
I was on the edge of my seat.

637
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,056
All I could think of

638
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,027
was if Amy's advice would have
been that we had to leave.

639
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,297
I don't know if I could.

640
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:57,300
STEVE: Their dream
was to own the hotel,

641
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,603
but it came with a price.

642
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,606
AMY:
I was out on the grounds,

643
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,842
and I was seeing
this substance,

644
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:08,376
like oil or water or both.

645
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:14,917
I felt like it had caused
a lot of problems here.

646
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,019
That's interesting.

647
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,205
The original owner
of the hotel itself

648
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,357
was a guy
by the name of Dr. Gray.

649
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,795
Back in 1859,
when he acquired the property,

650
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,327
he started looking for oil.

651
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:29,466
But what he did discover
was mineral water.

652
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,534
He decided that,
with the mineral water,

653
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,871
to make this place
into a wellness sanitarium.

654
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,640
- So, they'd just come here
and drink it? - Yeah.

655
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,611
The people that did come here,
they were all sick.

656
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,744
Interesting,

657
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:46,350
because I saw
a lot of sick people,

658
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,749
and I saw
a lot of gurneys.

659
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,688
So, most of the people
were kind of O.D.'ing on this?

660
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,588
Yeah. Instead
of getting better,

661
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:54,757
people might have
killed themselves doing it.

662
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,093
Oh, my gosh.

663
00:34:57,994 --> 00:35:01,848
We knew that the inn
had be founded as a sanitarium,

664
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:05,703
but we didn't know
that these sick, dying people

665
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:07,169
were still here.

666
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,572
This is not the place for them,

667
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,711
and they need to move on
and find peace.

668
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,712
STEVE:
So, what else did you see?

669
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:19,016
There were three different
cliques of dead people --

670
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:21,885
elderly people,
young adults,

671
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,153
and juvenile delinquents.

672
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,992
The leader of
this elderly group of people

673
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:31,346
was this guy
who had white hair,

674
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,357
and he was just
very authoritative.

675
00:35:34,392 --> 00:35:37,334
You get a good look
at this guy?

676
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,336
I sketched the man I saw.

677
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,203
AMY: He has a cane.

678
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:44,507
He has a mustache
and a beard,

679
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,246
and he has
very light, intense eyes.

680
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,218
You guys take a look.

681
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:57,437
To me,
this actually looks like

682
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:58,989
a younger version
of Dr. Gray.

683
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,923
BRENDA: Yeah.

684
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,759
LARRY: The expression
looks the same.

685
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,596
So, do you think that the guy
with the cane is Dr. Gray?

686
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,565
I think so, yeah.

687
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,499
When I saw the sketch

688
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:13,237
and I compared it
to the picture of Dr. Gray,

689
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,005
I could feel my heart racing.

690
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,874
I could hardly swallow.

691
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,041
Why was he here,

692
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,346
and were we doing something
to upset him?

693
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,580
Now, do these cliques
do anything

694
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,249
that can affect
the people that are living?

695
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,217
Oh, well, yeah.

696
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,587
It'll just get worse
and worse and worse.

697
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,323
BRENDA:
I'm thinking, "Oh, my God.

698
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,158
What are we gonna do?"

699
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,662
I've always wondered
if I was truly safe here,

700
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,066
and now I know
that we're in big trouble.

701
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,500
STEVE:
What else did you see?

702
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,471
I saw people on the ground,
and they were dead.

703
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,874
And their bodies
were bloated,

704
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:52,208
so I got that they drowned.

705
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,045
Well, that's easy enough
to explain.

706
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,677
This is French Creek
out here.

707
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:58,180
And there's been a lot of
drownings associated with it.

708
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,185
Two of those drownings
actually took place
right on the property.

709
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,585
I saw this woman.

710
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,920
She jumped inside of me.

711
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:08,625
She was trying to make me
go in the water and drown.

712
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,326
Oh.

713
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,029
What about the guests
that go near the water?
Could they be at risk?

714
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:15,831
Yes.

715
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,302
She's capable of jumping
other people.

716
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,536
BRENDA:
I'm not afraid of water,

717
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,508
but for some reason, I've never
gone that close to French Creek.

718
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,542
Now I know why.

719
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:30,047
And we have canoes that
we allow people to take out.

720
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,083
We need to stop doing that.

721
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,550
STEVE: Larry and Brenda,

722
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,737
You got hit with a lot
of information today.

723
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:38,815
The big question is,
is it safe for you guys,

724
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,139
your employees, and your guests
to be here?

725
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:45,736
Obviously, I think
that the woman outside,

726
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:49,299
she is possibly a threat
to the living.

727
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,553
So, what I would recommend

728
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:55,737
is to find
a psychotherapist.

729
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:59,377
But this psychotherapist
also needs to be a medium.

730
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:02,947
This individual
should find out what's up,

731
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:06,482
what's going on,
why is she here, all of that.

732
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:09,719
The second thing is to do
a cleansing of this building

733
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,956
to help with the removal
of the three main cliques

734
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,024
that are here.

735
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,096
Then, teach the housekeepers
how to do this basic cleansing

736
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,730
and that one time per week

737
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,500
they incorporate it
into their regular duties.

738
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,603
Let me ask you --
What about Dr. Gray?

739
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,738
I wouldn't try
to move him on.

740
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:33,977
But if he chooses to go,
then he can leave.

741
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,244
- He's not a threat?
- No.

742
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:39,583
Once they do all this,
do you think they'll be okay?

743
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,165
BRENDA:
When the reveal was over,
we had to make sure

744
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,171
that anything that was negative
would see its way out the door.

745
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:08,412
We hit roadblocks right and left
trying to find mediums,

746
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,879
but then I got a lead
on two ladies

747
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,518
who not only are sisters
but they also counsel the dead.

748
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:18,087
She said, "I'm crying.
I'm sad.

749
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:22,190
My child is gone,
and I want to hurt people."

750
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,178
They said the woman
down by the water was hurting.

751
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,123
Everyone goes through pain.
Everyone has loss.

752
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,034
We have to heal from that.
We have to move on.

753
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,968
You're just going to have to
find peace

754
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,139
and know that God is with you
and to go into the light.

755
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,241
And we're gonna help you
with the power of the prayer.

756
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,178
LARRY: The psychics made certain
she doesn't suffer anymore

757
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,813
and she doesn't
make anybody living suffer.

758
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:48,619
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

759
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,521
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

760
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,125
on Earth
as it is in heaven.

761
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,595
It's time for you to leave.

762
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:03,533
BRENDA:
And then, it was time to get rid
of the three different cliques.

763
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:08,539
I'm going to send some
healing energy and some sage

764
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,272
to cleanse.

765
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,942
They started walking through
the common-area rooms

766
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,443
and doing blessings.

767
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,546
The negative energies
who are here,

768
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,351
please cross into the light
and please go in peace.

769
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,138
I'm asking
that the bad spirits go out

770
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,890
and that the good spirits
come in.

771
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,992
Positive energy, stay.

772
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,030
Feel the love.
Feel the white light.

773
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,998
Then,
they went up to the guest rooms,

774
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:40,304
and they used holy water and a
clapping method with vibration

775
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,689
to get the cliques to leave.

776
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:45,040
Vibrations,
I'm asking you

777
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,276
to attach the vibrations
to the spirits

778
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:52,483
and to just keep them moving
into the light.

779
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:55,350
LARRY:
It was intense not knowing

780
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:59,306
if the cleansing would get rid
of those negative forces.

781
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:03,227
So, we're asking the elders
to just leave this room.

782
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,427
Take the negative energy
and just go away.

783
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,365
In the name of the father,
the son, and the Holy Ghost.

784
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,502
Just go into the light
and be at peace.

785
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:18,742
Because this building
is so old and so large,

786
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,610
the mediums
taught me and my staff

787
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,547
how to do the cleansing
on a continual basis

788
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,115
so that it becomes
a weekly ritual.

789
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,386
You're asking them
to go into the light,

790
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,586
to attach to the smoke.

791
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:33,489
So, say,
"attach to the smoke."

792
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,659
Attach to the smoke.
Go into the light.

793
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,293
There's still
some activity here,

794
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,231
but when I walk through
the front door,

795
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,701
I can feel
a more positive energy

796
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,620
in this building.

797
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:48,470
But my concern is

798
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:52,409
can we keep those negative
energies from coming back?

799
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:58,248
BRENDA: People that come here
come to stay and relax.

800
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:02,417
And the dead
need to respect that.

801
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:07,824
I honestly feel that this place
is a wonderful place

802
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,060
and we belong here.

803
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,734
AMY: The Riverside Inn
had attracted a lot of dead,

804
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,635
but only a few of them
posed any real threat.

805
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,873
Now that Brenda has the tools
to help move them on,

806
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,640
she should be able to make sure

807
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:29,046
any unwanted guests
don't overstay their welcome.
