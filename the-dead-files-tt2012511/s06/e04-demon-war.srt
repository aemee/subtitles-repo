1
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:14,187
Those creatures are here.

2
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:16,413
They can take your soul.

3
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:18,154
It was a man, but he didn't look human.

4
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:19,761
That had to scare the [bleep] out of you.

5
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:22,133
They have, like, pointed ears, sharp teeth.

6
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:24,036
Seems like she's possessed sometimes.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,833
A lot of [bleep] pain in this room.

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,218
I live in constant fear we're being haunted.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,193
What is going on here?

10
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:36,569
"You're mine. You can't escape."

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,740
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,643
What's happening?

13
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,046
I see dead people.

14
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,089
It seems like a devil.

15
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,028
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:48,550
He's pissed off.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,182
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,001
I felt real fear.

19
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,412
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:56,687
I think she's being murdered.

21
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,489
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:00,192
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,196
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:03,904
Serial killer pops in my head.

25
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:07,608
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,810
Nobody believes me.

27
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:10,278
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,056
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

29
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,590
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,831
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,535
Until the very end.

32
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:19,091
You got problems. I got news for you.

33
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:21,314
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:22,885
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

35
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,823
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,366
This is their house, the house of the dead.

37
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,405
I'm in the heart of the rust belt...
Toledo, Ohio.

38
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,543
I'm heading over to meet
with a woman named Angie.

39
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,784
She says everyone in the
family's being affected.

40
00:01:55,786 --> 00:02:00,024
They're being pushed, scratched,
burnt, and even molested.

41
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:02,497
When I heard this on the phone, I got upset.

42
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,099
And I'm really hoping we can help her out.

43
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,148
Before Amy arrives,

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,918
I look for any leading information.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,790
This house is filled with
photos and religious symbols.

46
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,061
Once they're covered or removed,

47
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,831
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

48
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,829
What the hell?

49
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,770
There's a male here who...

50
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:57,044
knows how it used to be and is disturbed,

51
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:01,214
so he's very much
functioning in that reality,

52
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,582
and he's angry.

53
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,982
He's [bleep] pissed.

54
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,384
There's something wrong with his head.

55
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,956
Mm.

56
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,591
The head pain is so bad.

57
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,608
So, Angie, I'm glad I'm here

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,844
'cause you sounded pretty
upset on the phone.

59
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:32,212
So,
just give me an idea of what's happening.

60
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,584
- We've been here about 12 years.
- Okay.

61
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,355
Shortly after we moved in is
when the activity started.

62
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:40,854
At first, it just started out as noises.

63
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:44,056
It increased to apparitions.

64
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,256
It's getting now to the point
where it's getting violent.

65
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,825
We've had a couple of episodes
where we've been burned.

66
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,761
We've been scratched,

67
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:55,761
we've been pushed, we've been shoved.

68
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:58,595
I live in constant fear here.

69
00:03:58,597 --> 00:03:59,864
Who do you live here with?

70
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,699
I live here with my partner, Leslie,

71
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,100
my daughter, Maggie,

72
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:06,372
and my 2-year-old grandson, Nathan.

73
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,676
Oh, he's precious.

74
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:11,879
It seems like it got
worse after he was born.

75
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,186
- Is he being affected by this?
- He is.

76
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,821
We were sitting in the living room,
watching TV.

77
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,661
He was sitting on the floor,
playing with his toys,

78
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,495
and we seen him literally
lift up off the ground

79
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,463
and was shoved a good foot and a half.

80
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,503
I fear greatly for him

81
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:32,239
because he's unable to protect himself,

82
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,641
and I feel like we can't protect him,
either.

83
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:37,780
- Why don't you just move?
- We're into it financially.

84
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,016
We put all of our money
into buying this home,

85
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,183
and we can't afford to move.

86
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,317
Do you know any history of the house at all?

87
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,384
Me, personally, no.

88
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,520
I don't know any history of the house.

89
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,654
Have you ever had paranormal activity

90
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,824
- prior to moving into this house?
- Never.

91
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,324
- I was never a believer.
- What about now?

92
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:56,890
I believe it wholeheartedly.

93
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:58,258
We're being haunted.

94
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,963
There's something here,

95
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,766
and it came in through the front door.

96
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:15,033
These things...
they look like little [bleep] demons,

97
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:17,502
and they're getting too out of hand.

98
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:22,039
That's what this older dude was saying.

99
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,574
And he says, "I can't handle that.

100
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,607
"I can't get involved in that.

101
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,940
I can't do anything about that."

102
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:34,244
Things have just gotten too bad.

103
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,478
He can't fight anymore
because they're gonna get him.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,814
They can take your soul.

105
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:50,898
Okay, what's going on in here?

106
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,334
I've seen various apparitions in here.

107
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,269
There was an older gentleman I seen in here,

108
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,036
wearing kind of like a suit.

109
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,470
Grayish hair.

110
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,173
He startles me at first,
but he doesn't seem threatening.

111
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,043
Okay,
what time period do you think he's from?

112
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:07,277
I would say early 1900s.

113
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,715
If you saw a photo,
would you be able to identify him?

114
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,250
I would.

115
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:12,417
Now, what else are you seeing in here?

116
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,253
One time in the stairwell,

117
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:18,025
there was an apparition of a little boy.

118
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,327
Can you describe him?

119
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,630
He appeared to have been in a fire.

120
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,566
He had a burnt face, burnt arms.

121
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:27,770
Angie, I got to do my due diligence and ask

122
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,672
questions you're not gonna like, but...

123
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:32,574
Okay. Medications? Alcohol abuse?

124
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,277
Anything that may cause you to hallucinate

125
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,144
and see these things?

126
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,578
No, sir.

127
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,710
- I seen one other one.
- What's that?

128
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,412
This one bothers me
'cause it really scared me.

129
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,750
It was a man, but he didn't look human.

130
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:51,021
He was in the mirror.

131
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:54,589
He had two horns off the top of his head.

132
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,723
Big teeth.

133
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,258
I would say at least 6 foot,

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,794
and I seen him kind of let out a growl,

135
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,665
and it came right at me.

136
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,765
"Foof," right through me,

137
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,602
and I immediately broke out into tears,

138
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,470
felt like I was gonna faint.

139
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,138
I was sick to my stomach.

140
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,040
- That had to scare the [bleep] out of you.
- It did.

141
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,241
All I can tell you, Steve,

142
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:17,311
it was the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

143
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:27,821
Those demons...
they are very [bleep] weird-looking.

144
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,558
They kind of have, like, bat faces.

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,693
They have, like, pointed ears, big eyes,

146
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:39,133
sharp teeth,
kind of centered on this female.

147
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:46,778
Okay, what's going on in here?

148
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,014
I've had things move around in the room.

149
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,787
I've had my glasses moved.

150
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,256
You sure it's not your
grandson maybe playing games

151
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:55,458
or just moving stuff on you?

152
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,493
Probably not.

153
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,630
He's two, and most of it's up high...

154
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:02,567
the stuff that's moved...
and I put my glasses up high,

155
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,669
- so no, it's not him.
- All right.

156
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,104
Anything else?

157
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:08,472
I was laying in bed, sleeping one night,

158
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:13,240
and I had a physical presence come over me.

159
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,441
I felt like I was being pinned to the bed.

160
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:21,678
My shirt was pulled up around my chest area.

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,213
- Okay.
- I felt like I was being

162
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:25,619
physically assaulted at the moment.

163
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,853
Talking about sexually assaulted?

164
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,886
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:33,960
I just remember feeling... violated.

166
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,260
I was just crying.

167
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,496
Okay. So, how long did it last?

168
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,600
It seemed like it lasted forever,

169
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,304
but I started praying,

170
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,436
and within a couple of minutes, it stopped.

171
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:52,252
There's a lot of things

172
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,889
that went on up here.

173
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,830
There's, like, panic.

174
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:06,599
Oh, geez.

175
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,236
Uh...

176
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,375
Oh.

177
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:14,679
I am seeing a woman.

178
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,745
She's being...

179
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:23,450
physically attacked by nothing... like,
dragged.

180
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:27,120
What the [bleep] is going on here?

181
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,292
She's not the only one.

182
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,600
Holy [bleep]

183
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:42,304
This is, like, one of the worst rooms.

184
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,006
Why?

185
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,910
There's definitely an agent here

186
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,915
who's [bleep] very unhappy

187
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:54,087
and not stable and lashing out.

188
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,796
It's a poltergeist.

189
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,437
Maggie, I was talking to your mom,

190
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,706
and she was telling me about everything
that's going on in the house.

191
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,243
Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,779
- Now, this is your son's room?
- Yes.

193
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,982
Apparently,
your mom said she actually saw him

194
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:35,916
get picked up and kind of thrown or pushed.

195
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:37,617
Yeah, it has happened.

196
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,087
He was playing in his room.

197
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,356
I was cleaning up,
and I heard him hit the ground,

198
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:45,629
and when I came into his room,
he was flat on his back,

199
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,531
and his face was bloodshot red.

200
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,931
- Now, was there anything he
could have jumped off of? - No.

201
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,168
He wasn't climbing on anything.
He didn't trip over anything.

202
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,738
As a mother, I know his cries,

203
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,938
and it was definitely something
I've never heard before.

204
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,638
Okay, so, this was a terrifying cry?

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,677
Yeah,
this was... he wanted to get out of here.

206
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,580
Something scared him.

207
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,614
Okay, anything else going on up here?

208
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,614
Yeah, actually.

209
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,380
One day, it was just me and him here,

210
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,583
and I came up to check on him,

211
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,450
and he was leaning out of his window,

212
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,687
throwing his toys out,
and this window's never unlocked.

213
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,757
There's no way he could unlock the window.

214
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,160
He can't open doors, like doorknobs.

215
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:27,899
I got really scared because he
could have easily fallen out.

216
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,067
- You said it's always locked?
- It's locked right now.

217
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,237
So, who would have unlocked it?

218
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,509
It's only me and him here,
and I definitely didn't do it.

219
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,845
- But it was closed when you last saw it?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:42,185
And there was nobody else around?

221
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,055
Nope.

222
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,659
That's a problem.

223
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,505
This is not good.

224
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,144
There might be someone here,

225
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:07,846
at a very [bleep] young age,

226
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,648
figured out that they were capable

227
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,582
of manipulating their environment,

228
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:16,051
and those are why those creatures are here.

229
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,688
There's a relationship there

230
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,823
between this thing and this living person.

231
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,894
The older man was trying to stop this,

232
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:32,364
then it changed, and now there's more.

233
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,032
There's more of them.

234
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,247
Leslie,
I was talking to your partner, Angie,

235
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,348
and I spoke to her daughter, Maggie,

236
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,115
they seemed pretty upset

237
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,682
- about the things that are happening here.
- Yes.

238
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,617
- I mean, she's your partner.
- Yes.

239
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,386
- I mean, she looks like she's taking it hard.
- Yeah, she does.

240
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:58,189
Hard on her and makes it hard on me

241
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,492
- to watch her go through some of the stuff.
- Right.

242
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:04,227
The fighting, and, just... it's hard.

243
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,493
- The mood swings.
- Especially Maggie.

244
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,728
Nothing.

245
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,498
I swear,
it seems like she's possessed sometimes...

246
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,737
just angry and mean and hateful she gets.

247
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,306
I don't like the drama.

248
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:18,341
Just want everything to go back to normal.

249
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,677
Well,
that brings me to a question I have for you.

250
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,681
I mean, everybody's experienced something.

251
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:23,917
- Have you?
- Yes, I have.

252
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,418
Okay, like what?

253
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,854
My cross on my neck got ripped off

254
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,054
and thrown across the floor.

255
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,790
- You mean, you had a necklace?
- Yes.

256
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,356
And it ripped off your chest?

257
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,690
Ripped off. Yes. Broke.

258
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,793
Thrown across the hardwood floor and slid.

259
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:42,957
That's...

260
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,327
It was strange.

261
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:47,129
- Strange? It's a little bit scary.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,732
- Was anybody else home?
- No.

263
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,465
So, what did you end up
doing when that happened?

264
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,533
- Did you get your cross again?
- Yeah, I sure did.

265
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,401
I picked it back up, and I said,
"You think you broke it?

266
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:57,870
You didn't 'cause I got another
clasp I can put it on,"

267
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,672
and I stuck it back on another one.

268
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,173
I don't know what my partner's gonna say.

269
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,043
She may tell you that whatever's here,
you can't fix.

270
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,415
You got to get the hell out of here.

271
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,885
I mean, how would you feel about that?

272
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,318
I'd probably get the hell out of here.

273
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,153
- You would?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,859
There's the battle.

275
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,925
There's this [bleep] battle going on

276
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:20,397
between the living and these things.

277
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,230
Do you know what these things are?

278
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,299
I don't believe they were ever alive.

279
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,538
I guess you would call them,
like, some kind of demons.

280
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,041
They're kept out.

281
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:34,978
They can be kept at bay because
they respond to religion,

282
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,715
but it doesn't matter because
the poltergeist is always here.

283
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,020
There's a lot of pain in this room.

284
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,823
A lot of [bleep] pain in this room.

285
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:53,325
The living... they're fighting,

286
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,160
and they're crying, and it never stops.

287
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,631
These people...
what they're doing to each other, it's awful.

288
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,432
I can't stand it anymore.

289
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,500
Would you say it's dangerous
for the living to be here?

290
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,301
The house isn't the issue.

291
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,434
What is?

292
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,671
They are.

293
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,175
They who?

294
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,977
The living people.

295
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:27,017
Angie didn't know any history about her home,

296
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,586
so I made a few calls.

297
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,955
And a retired homicide detective tells me

298
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,957
a famous criminal used to live there.

299
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,359
He did some research into it for me,

300
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,094
and he found some information he says

301
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,863
will definitely help my investigation.

302
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,005
Well, Bob, thanks for meeting me.

303
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,505
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

304
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:54,072
Now, you mentioned on the phone
there was an actual criminal

305
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:55,871
that lived in the property
I'm investigating.

306
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,272
Right. Yes, there was.

307
00:15:57,274 --> 00:16:00,510
Clarence Brown had moved into
that home with his family.

308
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,311
He was young.

309
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:04,813
He was 17 at the time in 1930.

310
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,982
Of course,
the Depression hit the family real bad,

311
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,820
and they lost most of everything they had,

312
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:14,159
even though they had had a
lucrative printing business.

313
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,293
Clarence especially took it pretty hard.

314
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,993
He didn't think the government

315
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:20,627
put enough money into the local economy,

316
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,231
and he was gonna do his part to help out,

317
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,467
and he got this idea about
counterfeiting bills.

318
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,602
He kind of felt like he was a Robin Hood.

319
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,238
Here's a picture of him.

320
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,441
He was just a clean-cut,
ordinary-looking kid, you know.

321
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:38,178
Now, was he operating out of
the house I'm investigating?

322
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,747
He operated out of the house,
and then, I guess,

323
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,117
part of it moved over to
the family printing business

324
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,222
across the river on Huron Street.

325
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,057
How big of an operation
are we talking about?

326
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,757
Well, they got to the point

327
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,792
of being considered international.

328
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:54,529
There was a lot of their
money showing up in Indiana,

329
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,464
Michigan, the surrounding states,

330
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:59,236
Illinois, even into Windsor, Canada.

331
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:02,407
- So, who was all involved?
Was it just this guy, Clarence? - Well, no.

332
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:05,244
Clarence and Sherman,
his dad, and his brother,

333
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,379
and two other associates.

334
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,882
Okay, so, he basically ran it.

335
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:10,452
- Yes, he did.
- So, what happens next?

336
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:13,821
Eventually, he got caught.
They were busted in 1935.

337
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:17,529
They raided the Huron Street plant

338
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:20,897
and seized probably $20,000 there

339
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:22,831
- and a bunch of equipment.
- Okay.

340
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,231
That led them over to

341
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:27,065
the house that you're
looking into on east side.

342
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:30,099
Got another 6 grand there
and a lot of equipment.

343
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,036
A lot of money back then.
That's a lot of money today.

344
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,568
Yeah, in today's figures,
it would be about $340,000.

345
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,940
Now, when all is said and done,
how many people got arrested?

346
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,474
There were five total, yes.

347
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,545
It was Clarence; his father, Sherman;

348
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:46,382
brother Louis; and two other associates.

349
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,648
But when it came to trial,
according to this article here,

350
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,985
Clarence took the heat for the entire family

351
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:55,557
and got a 31/2-year sentence,

352
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,393
and he did about 21/2 years.

353
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:04,103
The older male,

354
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,574
I feel him very much
involved with the structure.

355
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:09,109
Do you know anything about
what he was like in life?

356
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:13,780
I would say that he was a...

357
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:16,148
no bull[bleep] kind of guy.

358
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,586
I would guess that he might have been,
like, a boss

359
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,656
because he's very much like,

360
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:26,225
"This is what's going on. This is what
we're doing. This is what's happening."

361
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,196
Does the old man interact with the living?

362
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:32,503
It think he's tried talking to them.

363
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:37,010
He's definitely trying to
keep these demons at bay.

364
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:39,746
I think he was also trying

365
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:44,118
to give warnings about what's going on.

366
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,492
Like, I see him talking to
somebody laying in bed,

367
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:54,364
trying to explain things to them.

368
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,306
So, he gets sentenced to 31/2 years.

369
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,108
- He does 21/2, and he gets out.
- Right.

370
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,345
Okay, does he go back to counterfeiting?
I mean, what's he do?

371
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,079
No, he gave up the counterfeiting,

372
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,913
moved back into your clients' house.

373
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,615
His mom lived there, too.

374
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,483
He got a job at a local printing shop,

375
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,619
and then he got married in 1940.

376
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:16,323
And this was the wedding
of Clarence and his wife.

377
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,460
And him and his wife had three little boys.

378
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,330
Okay, so, what happens to this guy?

379
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:26,100
Well, things went real
bad in 1948 initially,

380
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:27,868
when his mother died.

381
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,403
It hit him pretty hard.

382
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:34,174
Kind of started into a
downward spiral mentally.

383
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:36,642
- Did she die in the house?
- She died at home.

384
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,878
I have the death certificate here.

385
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,653
Okay, so, cerebral hemorrhages.

386
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,418
- So, it was a natural cause.
- Right.

387
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,820
So, what happens after that?

388
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:49,689
Things started spiraling downhill.

389
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,958
He was developing a real paranoia.

390
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,897
He was convinced the
government was out to get him.

391
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,330
They were spying on him.

392
00:19:56,332 --> 00:20:00,100
He had pretty much
alienated his wife and sons.

393
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:03,106
It got so bad that she
actually had him committed.

394
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:05,976
They used electroshock therapy on him,

395
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,677
which apparently didn't help,

396
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
and it got so bad that she eventually

397
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:11,380
had him committed to a
mental institution...

398
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,751
where he spent the
last 26 years of his life,

399
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:18,089
dying at age 83.

400
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,125
This guy was the leader of a
pretty good-sized operation

401
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,096
early on in his life,

402
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,066
and he died, wasted down to nothing.

403
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:36,411
This guy is [bleep] sick.

404
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,848
Do you know how he died?
Something with his head.

405
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,787
He had a lot of pain in his head.

406
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,320
That's all I know.

407
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,893
He was sick for a long time. I know that.

408
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:51,928
This [bleep] so thick.

409
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,599
I don't know how they
[bleep] even stay here.

410
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,509
So far,
I've uncovered a major counterfeit ring

411
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,877
tied to my clients' property,

412
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,313
where the previous owner

413
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,648
was committed to a mental institution.

414
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,353
But I need to see if there's anything else.

415
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,894
Searching through old archives,

416
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:24,728
I find something I didn't expect...

417
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:30,103
a deadly explosion that happened in 1898

418
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:34,210
right down the street from my clients'
house.

419
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:37,313
I've called out a local reporter

420
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:40,649
who says it was one of the worst
accidents in Toledo's history.

421
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:53,062
This explosion I came across...
what exactly happened?

422
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:55,128
So, there was the Union Railroad,

423
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,696
which had a grain elevator.

424
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,998
Here it is right here.

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,003
On the night of September 21, 1898,

426
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,638
25 people were working there.

427
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,073
They had just received a big
shipment of oats, and they were,

428
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,475
you know, processing these oats,

429
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:12,378
but they didn't have the
safety mechanisms in place.

430
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,412
So, there were highly
flammable dust particles

431
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:16,945
- in the air from this device.
- Okay.

432
00:22:16,947 --> 00:22:19,315
And somehow or another,
these floating dust particles

433
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,717
got into the furnace,

434
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,617
which then exploded.

435
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,851
This is the aftermath.

436
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:29,687
This is the rubble from
the explosion and the fire.

437
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:33,689
Wow.

438
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,626
I mean, it just looks like

439
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:37,459
somebody dropped a 500-pound bomb on it.

440
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:38,694
Oh, yeah.

441
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,730
Where my clients'
property is is pretty close.

442
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,402
What would it have felt like for them?

443
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,836
It felt like an earthquake.

444
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,304
It broke out windows.

445
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,475
It melted rail road cars.

446
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:52,848
Everything with a 200-foot
radius was consumed by flames.

447
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,414
Wow.

448
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,814
15 people were killed.

449
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:59,252
- Two of those bodies were never recovered.
- At all?

450
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,920
Essentially,
they were just reduced to ashes.

451
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,390
One of the bodies that was never recovered

452
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:08,963
was the youngest son of the superintendent,
Mr. Parks.

453
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:10,665
Harold was 6.

454
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,835
And then, shortly after he died,

455
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:16,102
his 10-year-old son, Hamilton,

456
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,274
- also died as a result of the explosion.
- Wow.

457
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:22,079
He also had his daughter,
Grace, a 19-year-old,

458
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:25,083
who died a day after the accident.

459
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,985
That's a real tragedy.

460
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:29,455
One of the headlines referred to it

461
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,390
as "The Holocaust at Toledo."

462
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,032
I'm seeing people running.

463
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:43,434
They're screaming.

464
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:47,836
I'm just getting a lot of physical trauma.

465
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:52,176
It was something that was huge.

466
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,147
Something unexpected, something very big.

467
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,116
Getting a big accident.

468
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:02,354
Like a building collapsing on them.

469
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,667
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk,

470
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,636
but what has me the most concerned

471
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,837
are the demon creatures
tormenting the living.

472
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,676
There were three or four
that came from the closet,

473
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,347
and there was a small kid,

474
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:30,021
and one of them was standing behind him.

475
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:32,191
Okay.

476
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:34,963
The nose was kind of like a pig's nose...

477
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:39,099
and it had, like, fangs.

478
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,835
- What about the build?
- Very thin.

479
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:46,532
Longer than the average arms.

480
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:54,241
Is this what you saw?

481
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:00,611
Yes, that's what I saw.

482
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,755
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

483
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,257
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

484
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,458
and our clients for the first time.

485
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,385
Amy, I'd like you to meet

486
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,719
the three ladies that live in this house.

487
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,387
This is Maggie.

488
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,187
This is Angie, Maggie's mom,

489
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:43,691
and this is Leslie, Angie's partner.

490
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,759
All three of them are
having a tough time here,

491
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,027
and they've experienced a lot,

492
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,064
but the main reason we're here

493
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,929
is for Maggie's 2-year-old son, Nathan.

494
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,866
Aww.

495
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,036
Now, the ladies don't think
it's safe for any of them,

496
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,236
but they're more concerned for him.

497
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:02,041
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

498
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:05,144
I'll ask her to tell us about her walk.

499
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,051
So, I was outside,

500
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:14,386
and I started seeing all
of these dead people.

501
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:18,392
They were not looking very good.

502
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:21,194
It seemed like some kind of major accident

503
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,632
that all of these people
had been involved with,

504
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:26,802
and they were in a lot of pain and agony.

505
00:26:26,804 --> 00:26:32,710
It seemed to me like some kind of collapse,
like a building.

506
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,980
It makes sense.

507
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:36,983
One of the worst accidents
in Toledo's history

508
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:40,418
happened only half a mile
from your residence here.

509
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,158
It was an accident
involving the Union Railroad

510
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,496
where the grain elevator was operated.

511
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:50,598
This is what the factory looked like.

512
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:55,673
Now, back on September 21, 1898,

513
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:58,106
dust got into the boiler, and boom.

514
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,510
Huge explosion.

515
00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:03,747
This is what it looked like after.

516
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:07,751
It looks like a war zone.

517
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,788
28 people were in the building.

518
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,521
15 died.

519
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:15,717
Only 13 bodies were recovered.

520
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,753
Two actually just burnt to a crisp.

521
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,189
They never recovered them.

522
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:22,193
Worst part of this story is

523
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:24,228
the three kids that were
killed because they were there,

524
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,062
visiting their father,
who was the superintendent.

525
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,533
I saw a young boy in the staircase,

526
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,400
and he was burnt.

527
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,070
He was burnt all over.

528
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:38,305
I've also seen him at the top of the stairs.

529
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:41,406
Now, could these kids
have come inside the house here?

530
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,874
Yes.

531
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:45,376
They're all over the neighborhood...
these people.

532
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:50,144
What else did you see on your walk?

533
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:51,813
I did meet an older male.

534
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:59,825
This individual has been trying
to warn you for some time.

535
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:02,228
He's here to protect.

536
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,032
He's been trying to communicate to you

537
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:08,605
via literally talking to you
or through dreams, as well.

538
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:11,775
- You told me about the old man, right?
- Right.

539
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:14,114
I often see him tinkering around.

540
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,282
We call him Clarence.

541
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,419
We don't know if that's his real name.

542
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,955
Where'd you get the name Clarence from?

543
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:22,456
I don't know. I just named him it.

544
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:26,227
I don't know if it came to me in a dream.
They've been talking to you.

545
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:28,061
You know what kind of guy
he was when he was alive?

546
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:31,564
Straightforward guy,
just told you like it was.

547
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,197
He liked to fix problems.

548
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,300
He took charge. He took control.

549
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,233
He was a boss.

550
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,035
Um...

551
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:42,004
I started to have...

552
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:45,573
extreme pain in my head,

553
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,443
and I knew that it was coming from him.

554
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:50,912
Well, I'll tell you a story

555
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:52,611
about a guy that lived in this house.

556
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,346
Name was Clarence.

557
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:56,513
Really?

558
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,213
Hmm.

559
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,882
- Clarence Brown.
- My God.

560
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:02,386
You didn't know that?

561
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:05,324
Okay, he was 17 years old
when he moved here in 1930.

562
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,294
Lived here with his father,
his mother, and his brother.

563
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,463
Father had a printing shop in town.

564
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,429
Depression hits, and they lose everything.

565
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:14,800
Clarence is a 17-year-old kid.

566
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:16,836
He decided, "You know what?

567
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,970
"I'm gonna start up a
counterfeiting business

568
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:23,374
right in the basement here and
in the shop in Huron Street."

569
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:26,140
So, he employed his father, his brother,

570
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:28,274
and they were printing up money

571
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:29,976
to the point where it got international.

572
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,646
He was pissed about the government

573
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:36,381
not doing the right thing
and helping the city.

574
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,518
So, he thought by making money

575
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,154
and putting it into the community,
it would help things.

576
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,724
So, it's 1935. The FBI busts him.

577
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:47,828
- They arrested everybody... his father,
his brother. - Oh [bleep]

578
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,030
He said, "No, no. It was all on me.

579
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,633
I'm the one that came up
with this whole scheme."

580
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,471
He took the hit,

581
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,707
and he did 21/2 out of 31/2
years he was supposed to do.

582
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,844
So, he gets out of jail, comes back,

583
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,612
and moves back into this house,

584
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,147
gets married to a woman named Florence.

585
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,348
And this is a photo.

586
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,185
This is him and Florence
when they got married.

587
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:10,352
They had three boys and lived here.

588
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:13,722
He goes straight, and he goes to
work for a local printing shop.

589
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,422
1948, his mom,

590
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:19,761
who lived in this house with him,
died in the house.

591
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:24,833
That's when his life
kind of went for a turn.

592
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:28,237
He starts getting mentally unstable.

593
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:31,237
His wife tried everything...

594
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,407
in and out of doctors,
electroshock therapy.

595
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:38,781
1971, she had him committed
into a mental hospital.

596
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:44,015
- He laid there for 26 years till he died,
1997. - Geez.

597
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,220
Now, that head pain you were talking about.

598
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:48,421
I have his death certificate.

599
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:52,056
He died of cerebral atrophy.

600
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,698
I got photos of him later on in life.

601
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:03,105
That's him right there.

602
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:06,309
- So, you never knew the name Clarence?
- I didn't.

603
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,443
You're not bull[bleep] me, right?

604
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,644
I'm not bull[bleep] I'm
not bull[bleep] you.

605
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:11,244
It happened, Steve.

606
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,814
He's been talking to her for years.

607
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:18,149
- You're pretty sure you met Clarence?
- Yeah.

608
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,616
I'm blown away myself.

609
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:22,051
Makes me very emotional.

610
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,997
A lot of issues were going on upstairs.

611
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:39,039
When I went into the bedroom to the right,

612
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,009
it almost felt like I was suffocating.

613
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,544
There's somebody in there

614
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:45,915
who's very unhappy and lashing out.

615
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:49,019
That person was a possible
poltergeist agent.

616
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:52,889
Their emotions were coming
out in a physical way

617
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:55,193
and affecting their surroundings...

618
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,361
objects moving without explanation

619
00:31:57,363 --> 00:32:00,430
and possible harm to others.

620
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:01,699
Oh, my gosh.

621
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,832
That was my old room.

622
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,601
I have really, really bad mood swings.

623
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:09,773
Sometimes,
I can just go from being really happy

624
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,206
to being really, really pissed off.

625
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,314
- Is there a poltergeist here?
- Absolutely.

626
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,114
Is she the living agent?

627
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:22,351
I don't know if she created the poltergeist,

628
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:23,718
but she's definitely feeding it.

629
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,688
It isn't a fully formed
entity at this point,

630
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,122
but it can cause a lot of chaos.

631
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:33,992
When I first walked upstairs,

632
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,501
I did see a woman get physically attacked.

633
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:41,208
I saw her get lifted off the floor

634
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,510
and dragged across the little hallway.

635
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:47,815
She wasn't the only one
being physically harmed.

636
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:57,028
I was, uh... held down in the bed

637
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,333
and sexually assaulted...

638
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:03,071
in that bedroom.

639
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,739
I couldn't breathe.

640
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,442
I couldn't move.

641
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,977
I don't know how long it lasted.

642
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:11,280
It seemed like it lasted forever,

643
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:15,549
and when it was gone, it was gone,

644
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,950
but I was very sick after that.

645
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:20,188
So, was this poltergeist what
could have attacked Angie?

646
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,256
Oh, no. That, I think, is something else.

647
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:29,864
The older man was telling
me that he had been fighting

648
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:34,270
for quite some time a particular entity,

649
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:36,105
but now there's more,

650
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:40,806
and he can't contend with them any further.

651
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,977
They're very strange-looking.

652
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,878
They kind of have bat faces.

653
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,511
Their mouths are kind of round,

654
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:48,279
and they have, like, very sharp teeth.

655
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:50,449
They have the pointed ears.

656
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:53,349
I do not think that these
things were ever alive.

657
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:57,820
I think they're innately, inherently evil.

658
00:33:57,822 --> 00:34:02,492
One thing I noticed was someone was saying

659
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,993
some type of religious statement,

660
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:09,269
and it did make them back... <i>back</i> up.

661
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:12,373
So, for lack of a better word,

662
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,212
I would say that these things
are some kind of demons.

663
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:20,518
You guys say when you pray, it stops.

664
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,220
Oh, yeah. It does.

665
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:26,092
Also, the closet where I
saw most of these things

666
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:28,964
was in the smaller room upstairs.

667
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,465
That's my son's room.

668
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:34,534
Is it possible that he's seen them?

669
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,035
Yes.

670
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:37,534
Because...

671
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:41,307
he used to wake up with
really bad nightmares...

672
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:45,810
and he's been pushed in his room before.

673
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:52,083
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

674
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:03,589
Oh, I feel sick.

675
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:08,460
Are you kidding me?

676
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:18,938
Oh, geez.

677
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,438
That's the thing that I see.

678
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:44,459
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

679
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,902
Oh, I feel sick.

680
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,140
Are you kidding me?

681
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,254
Oh, geez.

682
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:08,756
That's the thing that I see.

683
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:23,205
More than likely,
that's the thing that attacked you.

684
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,608
The big question for me now

685
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,676
is are those things still in the closet?

686
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:31,111
Um, yes.

687
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:42,356
It's all right, baby.

688
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:49,597
I just feel guilty.

689
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,198
Why would you feel guilty, baby?

690
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
Just remembering him waking up and...

691
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,776
There's just been times

692
00:36:58,778 --> 00:37:01,244
where I've kind of just put
him back to bed in there.

693
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:02,879
It just makes me feel guilty.

694
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:09,386
When I went into the child's room,

695
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:12,121
I became very upset.

696
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:17,161
The child in that room
had very strong abilities.

697
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:19,931
That child comprehended very quickly

698
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,968
that he had these abilities,

699
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,671
was able to manipulate his environment,

700
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:29,779
and therefore,
began attracting the other demons to come.

701
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,583
These things are extraordinarily dangerous

702
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:37,020
and that the older man is very concerned

703
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:42,131
and feels that they are
here to take... souls.

704
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:49,003
But their goal, really, is to...
possess him

705
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,944
so that they can

706
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:57,883
basically be able to function
through him to do harm.

707
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:01,089
All the things that
have happened to your son,

708
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:05,128
him getting pushed and thrown,

709
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,963
that would have been from these things?

710
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:08,601
Yes.

711
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,436
I worry about the baby.

712
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:14,539
Doesn't make me feel too
good about staying here.

713
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,775
I'll tell you that.

714
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,082
What do we do? That's what we need to know.

715
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,951
What do we do?

716
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:29,087
I know this is not what
you wanted to hear tonight.

717
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:30,689
At least you know what's
going on in the house now.

718
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:32,990
The big question is, though,

719
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:36,792
can you still stay here
and raise Nathan safely?

720
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,293
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy,

721
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:39,927
and hopefully,
she'll have an answer for you.

722
00:38:41,796 --> 00:38:46,430
It seems to me that what's
basically going on here

723
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:50,199
is that this older man is reaching out

724
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:54,769
because he really feels
like he failed his family,

725
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:59,241
and I think he wants to protect Nathan

726
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:02,942
because he sees history repeating itself.

727
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:04,511
I think that the first thing

728
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:07,648
that needs to be done immediately

729
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:13,387
is the contact of a priest
or a demonologist...

730
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:18,926
someone who can perform
an exorcism on the home

731
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:20,928
and the property

732
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,997
that is just to be directed towards

733
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:28,801
the negative demonic
entities that are present.

734
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:31,138
I want this exorcism

735
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:38,173
to not incorporate the older man at all,

736
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:43,045
so that needs to be stated to
the priest or demonologist.

737
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,615
The second thing that needs to
be done as soon as possible...

738
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,784
take Nathan to a child psychologist

739
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:52,019
for a behavior observation.

740
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:55,484
Once that's done,
give it about two or three weeks.

741
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:58,155
Really pay attention to his behavior.

742
00:39:58,157 --> 00:40:01,426
If it improves substantially,
everything's good.

743
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,226
If it does not,

744
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:07,863
then he, as well,
would need to be, uh, exorcised.

745
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:15,307
And that would have to be
done <i>only</i> by a priest.

746
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:18,910
The issue with the older male...

747
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:22,913
one night, Angie,
I want you to go and lay in your bed.

748
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:26,781
I want you to ask Clarence to come to you.

749
00:40:26,783 --> 00:40:29,654
Let him know that his work is done,

750
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:33,223
that he did a good job,
and it's time for him to go.

751
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,928
Concerning the poltergeist phenomenon,

752
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,365
Maggie should take up a physical
but gentle form of exercise,

753
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,202
such as yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

754
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:47,472
This will help you to learn
how to control your abilities.

755
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:50,407
It'll also serve as an emotional release.

756
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,142
You guys looked
pretty stunned when she said

757
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:54,940
the exorcism of the house,
but especially of the baby.

758
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:57,411
Yeah, I didn't expect that at all.

759
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,078
I didn't, either,
to be honest with you, so...

760
00:41:05,655 --> 00:41:09,424
We'll do what we have to do to protect him.

761
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,363
If, God forbid,
he has to have an exorcism from a priest,

762
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,397
what would he go through?

763
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:15,999
Would it be simple?

764
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:19,906
I don't think that it's a full possession,

765
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:23,543
so it would be fairly quick.

766
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:28,584
He probably wouldn't even
fully register what's going on.

767
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,252
He'd probably think that this person

768
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,219
was just praying over him,

769
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:35,788
so I don't think it would be

770
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,421
psychologically damaging in any way.

771
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:43,391
That's tough advice that she gave you,

772
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:45,729
and if, God forbid, he needs an exorcism,

773
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:48,696
- are you gonna go through that?
- Yeah, we have to.

774
00:41:48,698 --> 00:41:53,133
I don't want to, but I will.

775
00:41:55,372 --> 00:41:58,140
There are several dead
people on Angie's property,

776
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:01,144
but the demons inside
pose the greatest threat.

777
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:03,349
I believe if they follow my advice,

778
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,383
they will free their home
of the evil within it

779
00:42:05,385 --> 00:42:07,585
and be able to live a peaceful life.
