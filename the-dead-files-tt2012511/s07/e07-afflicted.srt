1
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:15,769
I think a lot of bad things
happened in the trees.

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,266
It's getting more violent.

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,874
I've been scratched.

4
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:21,450
I feel like I'm being watched.

5
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,939
Something's wrong with the kid.

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,388
It smells like rotting flesh.

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,670
When these people die,
they're stuck with this thing.

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:32,214
She's trying to drive her insane.

9
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,820
Something bad's going to happen.

10
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:37,330
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:39,101
There's panic.

12
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,538
And it's almost like a butchering.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,608
I see dead people.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,747
They all died horribly.

15
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,464
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,869
Get out of here.

17
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,508
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,546
Vicious.

19
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:53,694
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:55,607
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

21
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,879
I rely on my partner.

22
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,149
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,525
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,233
This guy's a real piece of work.

25
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:05,915
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,419
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

27
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,588
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,094
This is not good.

29
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,605
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,648
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,017
Until the very end...

32
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,823
I want my life back.

33
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:20,132
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:21,469
Is he trying to kill her?

35
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:22,806
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:24,209
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,112
This is going to kill us.

38
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:42,394
I'm down here in Covington,
Louisiana.

39
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:45,366
It's about 40 miles north of New Orleans.

40
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:50,511
I received a call from a woman
who was hysterical on the phone.

41
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:53,715
She said the activity in her
home destroyed her marriage,

42
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:56,087
and now it's going after her three kids.

43
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,526
When I spoke with her,
she really tugged at my heart,

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,961
and I hope we can help her out.

45
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,349
Before Amy arrives,
I have to make sure

46
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,422
the location is free from
any leading information.

47
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,831
Family photos, personal items, and books

48
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,472
have to be covered or removed.

49
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,909
When I'm finished,

50
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:22,382
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,169
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:39,812
The first thing that I got was
really extreme amounts of anger,

53
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,981
like deadly anger.

54
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,354
Uh-oh.

55
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:53,336
I think a lot of bad things
happened in the trees.

56
00:02:53,338 --> 00:03:01,418
It's very brutal, savage, and dark.

57
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,902
So, Rhonda, I'm glad I'm here.

58
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,608
Listening to you on the
phone broke my heart,

59
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,977
how desperate you are.

60
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,779
It's very stressful here.

61
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,519
Me and my children,
they're terrified, I'm terrified.

62
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,088
And how old are the kids?

63
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,928
This is Scarlett. She's 10.

64
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,765
Gilby, he's 6, and Savannah, she's 8.

65
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,534
Are they being affected?

66
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:38,209
Yes, I think Scarlett's probably
had the most experiences.

67
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:40,478
What have you experienced?

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,115
We're hearing a lot of footsteps, voices.

69
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:49,854
We're seeing shadows,
and now it's getting more violent.

70
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,523
How long have you been in the house?

71
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:52,657
December of '04.

72
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,795
My ex-husband and I custom-built the house.

73
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:56,430
- Your ex-husband?
- Yes.

74
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,864
Okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

75
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,199
Definitely think some of
the activity in this house

76
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,869
contributed to our divorce.

77
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,005
Why do you say that?

78
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,139
We were very much in love, very happy.

79
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,906
He was my soul mate.

80
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:12,273
And he was just never his regular self

81
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,975
after we moved here.

82
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,144
You saw a personality change?

83
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:19,980
Yes. And there was just other issues,
like substance abuse.

84
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:22,548
He was addicted to pain medication.

85
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,017
Geez. After moving here?

86
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:26,750
After moving here.

87
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:28,850
I don't mean to get nosy. I just...

88
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,985
The more I know,
the more I can convey to Amy.

89
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:33,421
Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,456
So you feel your husband's
personality and the mood swings

91
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,694
changed when he moved here with you?

92
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,795
What about yourself?

93
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,796
I definitely noticed it with myself, too.

94
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,862
Could be angry really easy.

95
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,698
I'm in pain a lot.

96
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,366
I started having health problems

97
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:50,402
the day after we bought the property.

98
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:55,435
It's a burning in my legs and feet,
and it's all the time.

99
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:58,772
And I've been to over 40 specialists.

100
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,043
They still don't know what's wrong with me

101
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,175
- or why it happened.
- Let me ask you a question.

102
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:06,309
As far as the investigation goes,

103
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,678
what are you hoping to get out of it?

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,313
I would hope that my children
and I could not be afraid,

105
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:14,747
have a normal childhood.

106
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,080
They shouldn't have to
live in fear like this.

107
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,888
This is, like, ridiculously painful.

108
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,653
The energy here is so
bad that it could...

109
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,924
Harm a sensitive.

110
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,992
It's strange

111
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:44,027
because it is composed of
not just the dead energy here

112
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,696
but also the living.

113
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:48,330
And they are absorbing this.

114
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:53,469
That's caused an illness,
I think, for the female here.

115
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,740
I don't know if it's
heart or if it's blood,

116
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:03,273
but there's something
physical that's manifested

117
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,808
as a result of this.

118
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,612
I see, like, restlessness.

119
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:11,947
I see panic. I see series of illnesses.

120
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,085
So this is something going on.

121
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:22,489
This has, like,
incapacitated this person at times.

122
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,057
I think there's been hospital visits.

123
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,295
And I'm, like, seeing this conversation,

124
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:29,364
and there's a male.

125
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:32,601
And he's just like, "Why don't"...

126
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,806
Like, "Why don't we just leave?"

127
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:41,814
God, I feel so sick.

128
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,955
So, what's going on up here?

129
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,258
I've been slapped up here.

130
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,858
You've been slapped?

131
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,424
- Yes.
- How?

132
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:57,528
I was over here, putting some things away,

133
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,966
and it felt like someone
slapped me on my butt.

134
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,167
Did something fall on you maybe?

135
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,836
No, nothing fell on me. Felt like a hand.

136
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,739
Okay. But did you look to see if any
of the kids were up here or anything?

137
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,108
Yeah, they were downstairs.

138
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,777
Any other physical things
happen to you up here?

139
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,612
Yes. This just happened recently.

140
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,047
I had three scratches
just appear on my arm.

141
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,782
Kind of looks like cat scratches, you know?

142
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:19,849
It's not.

143
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,485
The cat that sleeps with us is declawed.

144
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,955
They're still showing up here.

145
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:26,656
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

146
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:29,660
What about the kids?
Any experiences with them?

147
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,562
Yes, all of my children
have had similar attacks.

148
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,296
Okay.

149
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,603
Oh, God.

150
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:44,442
There's this old woman up here.

151
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:49,113
She is very grumpy.

152
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:52,581
Whoo! Ooh!

153
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,283
Whoo!

154
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,419
Talk about some [bleep] anger issues.

155
00:07:57,823 --> 00:08:00,324
She hates the living people.

156
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:04,291
She just says, "I haunt them.
That's what I do."

157
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:07,596
And she says she does it very well.

158
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,604
I think this old woman is
focused on an adult female here.

159
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:16,708
I'm thinking she's trying
to drive her insane.

160
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,877
All right.
So, what's going on in the bedroom,

161
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,878
as far as experiences go?

162
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,884
One night, I was touched a lot.

163
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:30,954
My head, my face, my hair was touched.

164
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,324
And then I felt someone
come on the foot of the bed

165
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,126
and, like, sit next to me like this,

166
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:38,528
and the bed went down,
and it didn't get back up.

167
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,299
It just stayed like this.

168
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,069
- It feel like a person?
- Yes.

169
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,105
It felt like a person
was getting in the bed.

170
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,671
How big of a person?

171
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:47,507
It felt like someone my size.

172
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:48,875
I mean, this is crazy.

173
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:50,276
This is what I'm used to.

174
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,778
Unless you live it every day,

175
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,381
people just don't understand
what you go through.

176
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:05,395
There have been times that the old woman

177
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:09,228
has beat on the living woman here.

178
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,368
I see her standing next to a bed.

179
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,235
And the old woman is very big

180
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:24,341
and literally just sits on her body.

181
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:29,279
And the woman's huge,
so it's like smushing the living woman.

182
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,119
She's trying to drive her crazy,

183
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:40,392
hoping that she's gonna lose
her [bleep] mind, basically.

184
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,548
How long did you live
here before you got divorced?

185
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,816
About seven years.

186
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:05,617
So, Scott,
the seven years you were living here,

187
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,618
did you ever experience
anything you couldn't explain?

188
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,787
You know, like the smells

189
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,024
that would just constantly
come from that room...

190
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,792
The same smells, like rotting flesh.

191
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:13,793
Which room are we talking about?

192
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:14,828
The playroom.

193
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,330
Did you ever investigate it?

194
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,867
Oh, yeah.

195
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,802
The drywall was, you know, dry.

196
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:23,104
I mean, it wasn't wet.
There was no moisture anywhere.

197
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,607
So, there was no indication of
a decaying body or anything?

198
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,541
- None.
- Anything else?

199
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,141
No. I'm here for Rhonda

200
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,176
because I know how much
this is affecting her.

201
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,213
Whether I'm a true believer or not, I mean,

202
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,351
I have to take care of my
kids and her, as well.

203
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,584
You realize they're getting scratched?

204
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,587
She told me about that.
She showed me some of the marks.

205
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,222
Yeah, I mean, that's got to drive you crazy.

206
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,522
It's horrible.

207
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:46,325
I mean, how do you protect your
child when that's going on?

208
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,028
They shouldn't have to
kind of go through this.

209
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,998
So, when I was talking to Rhonda,

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,667
she basically said you
guys were soul mates.

211
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you agree with that?

212
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,236
Oh, yeah. I have no doubt about that.

213
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,774
We felt like we were doing
everything the right way,

214
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,642
and then we moved in this house.

215
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,343
Things just started changing.

216
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,512
And the whole seven years I was here,

217
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,184
I was just more unhappy than
I've ever been in my life.

218
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,053
My behavior started becoming more...

219
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:11,089
little bit more aggressive.

220
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,123
So, you think you've changed
since you've been out of here?

221
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,624
It's a weird thing you would say that.

222
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,694
I don't think I've ever been
happier in my entire life.

223
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:24,664
There's this living male,
and he's just had it,

224
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,901
and he's very overly dramatic

225
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,640
and just, like, screaming at everyone.

226
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,980
He's just not reacting well, I think,

227
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:38,815
to everything that's going on, I guess.

228
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,680
He wants out.

229
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:44,787
He wants away from these people,
the living people.

230
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,556
I don't know why this
living man is flipping out,

231
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:50,392
but it has something to
do with the trees outside.

232
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:56,397
There's a male in this,
like, tree house thing.

233
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,803
There's some connection
between this dead man

234
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,838
and the living male at this place.

235
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,140
They have things in common.

236
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,546
I can't... can't keep talking to you

237
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:15,618
if this is gonna keep being in the way.

238
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,858
He likes this relationship

239
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,196
'cause he's felt lonely for a long time,

240
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,605
and he feels like this is
a kindred spirit for him.

241
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,433
- How old are you?
- 8.

242
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,609
8 years old.

243
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,376
Now, is this the room that you sleep in?

244
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,811
I would, but I don't.

245
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,450
You don't, huh? Where are you sleeping?

246
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,553
With my mom and my sister and my brother.

247
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:50,189
Okay. Why are you sleeping with mommy?

248
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,391
Because I don't want to sleep in my room

249
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,494
because I feel like I'm being watched.

250
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:57,296
Who do you think is watching you, honey?

251
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:58,797
I know it's not good.

252
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,234
Have you ever seen
anything or heard anything?

253
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,171
I saw a back of a lady's head in a bun.

254
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:07,208
Okay. Where did you see this lady's head?

255
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,377
In the kitchen, on a chair.

256
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,778
- In the kitchen?
- Yeah.

257
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,779
Okay.

258
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:13,046
Are you afraid of the house, honey?

259
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:14,180
Yeah.

260
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,914
Any place you don't like being alone in?

261
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,983
All of the places.

262
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,490
There's something here.
There's something...

263
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,425
There's something here.

264
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:31,027
Something's wrong with the kid.

265
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,064
Something's really wrong with her.

266
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,200
Mm.

267
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:39,900
Something... Something is inside the child.

268
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,035
I think it looks like a woman to her.

269
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,037
I saw something on the floor,

270
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,739
something like it crawled in
on the floor or something.

271
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,175
Then I, like, see this woman,

272
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,675
so I don't know if she
thinks it's a woman or not.

273
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,577
Sometimes she plays with it.

274
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,346
There's always somebody in the room,

275
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,513
and they're always talking,
and it's not good.

276
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,713
I don't know what this thing is.

277
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,180
I think it wants to take the kid.

278
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,623
So, Scarlett, I was talking to Mommy,

279
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,328
and she told me you were having
some experiences in the house.

280
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,628
- How old are you?
- 10.

281
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,563
Okay. And you're the oldest, right?

282
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:21,999
Yes.

283
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,169
You guys are going through a lot here, huh?

284
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,271
I've been touched and scratched.

285
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:29,944
I've been, like, grabbed.

286
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:32,978
I feel like fingers are just touching me.

287
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,881
Now, you said you get scratched.

288
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:37,552
How does that happen? What goes on?

289
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,686
It feels like somebody's scratching me,

290
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:43,090
and it burns really bad for,
like, a long time.

291
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,525
Maybe a minute later, I'll look down,

292
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:45,960
there's a giant scratch right there.

293
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:49,357
Has anything else happened in here?

294
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,958
I see apparitions.

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,793
Okay. Of what?

296
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:55,294
I've seen one of a girl.

297
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:58,130
She's wearing a long,
long, like, pink dress.

298
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,798
What... Did it look like it was old?

299
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,498
Like, old times, or does it look
like it was from recent times?

300
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,396
It looked like it was from old times.

301
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,266
Okay.

302
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,001
And I've seen, like, creatures in here.

303
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,871
What kind of creatures?

304
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,840
They look like people,

305
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:17,241
but they're, like,
all crouched down and scaly.

306
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:20,215
It looks a little bit more
like an alien or something.

307
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:21,482
What are they doing?

308
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,654
They're just staring at me.

309
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,491
I can tell by the look on your face,

310
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:27,594
you're really afraid of these things, huh?

311
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,798
Can you describe this thing now?

312
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,500
It can look, like, humanoid,

313
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,441
but it can also look like an animal.

314
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:41,309
It can change its height.

315
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,577
It can be standing on two feet,

316
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,647
or it can be like an animal, on all fours.

317
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,916
Always pitch-black,
and it does always have wings.

318
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,221
So, what would you call this?

319
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:57,157
Most people would call it, like, a demon,

320
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,792
but it's not... not a demon.

321
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,029
I think it's scarier.

322
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:09,902
I'm very confused how it's
associated or around a child.

323
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,272
And they can attach to people...
living people.

324
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:22,541
Like people who are
alcoholics or drug addicts.

325
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,143
They attach, typically,

326
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,246
to somebody who's in the throes of it.

327
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:29,214
When these people die,

328
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:32,783
they're stuck with this thing for,
like, eternity.

329
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:38,420
I've seen, like,
the dead people with these things,

330
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:43,558
and they look like
they're suffering greatly.

331
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,597
Like, they seriously, like,
better do what I say,

332
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,199
or people are gonna [bleep] die.

333
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:51,201
Period.

334
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:06,996
Even though Rhonda's house is new,

335
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,532
the property deeds go
back to the mid 1800s.

336
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,037
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

337
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,374
who said one of the
original owners of the land

338
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,976
suffered heartbreak, insanity, and death.

339
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:26,248
So, Mary, you mentioned on the phone

340
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,779
that the original owners of
the property I'm investigating

341
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,981
had a pretty tough time there,
a lot of tragedy.

342
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,746
Right. But before we get to that,

343
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,413
how did they even come to the property?

344
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:37,716
Well, Frances Bossier inherited
about 100 acres of property

345
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:41,352
from her deceased grandmother
in the Covington area,

346
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:44,654
which is where your
client's house is located.

347
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,457
This is the land patent,
showing her receiving the property.

348
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay. Now, who'd she come here with?

349
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:54,530
She came here with her husband, Joseph.

350
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,001
So I've got to assume back in the 1850s,
at some point,

351
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,738
the husband would've got the
property turned over to his name.

352
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,575
Correct.
She did turn over her assets to him.

353
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:05,776
But she thought that he
was being very reckless

354
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:06,777
with his investments,

355
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,814
so she actually sued him

356
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:12,386
to gain control of her property and funds.

357
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:15,456
We've actually been able to
find copies of the lawsuit.

358
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,891
Okay, so what happens?

359
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,492
Well, she actually won,

360
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:22,532
and he had to pay her her money back,

361
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,766
and she maintained control
of all of her property,

362
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,300
which was unheard of for that time period.

363
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,800
But he must have been very reckless.

364
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:30,935
Okay. So they were married when
they went to court on this.

365
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:32,269
Did it break them up after that?

366
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,302
No, it didn't.

367
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,904
Okay. Now, you mentioned on the phone

368
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,706
there was a lot of tragedy
with this family.

369
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,474
And I'm assuming it wasn't the court case.

370
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:42,910
No, unfortunately, in 1853,
their oldest daughter, Fanny,

371
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:46,315
drowned in an accident right
here in Lake Pontchartrain.

372
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,985
So I would assume,
between the court case against each other

373
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,320
and now they lose a kid,
it had to be tough on their marriage.

374
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,723
Of course.

375
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:55,192
Okay.

376
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:59,762
The old woman who beats
on the living woman here,

377
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,896
this is her house.

378
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,664
She wants the house back.

379
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,131
She doesn't want the living here.

380
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,832
I think she was wealthy.

381
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:11,472
What I see from her past is
a very dysfunctional family.

382
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,280
I don't think she had a very good life.

383
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,152
So somebody was tugging on me.

384
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:23,753
Okay. She's a little kid.

385
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:29,927
Kind of feel like she might have drowned...

386
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,265
but, like, in an outside water,

387
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:40,738
like, in, like,
a creek or lake or something.

388
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,174
You aren't kidding when you said

389
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,744
there was tragedy with this family.

390
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,413
Right, and, actually, that's not it.

391
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:48,514
There was something else.

392
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,217
In 1859, Joseph Bossier got involved

393
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:54,121
with a man named J.M. Vernon.

394
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:56,620
And he was his business partner,

395
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:59,891
and, like all of Bossier's
business dealings, it went sour.

396
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:03,628
J.M. Vernon was a newspaper editor,

397
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,063
so to get Bossier back,

398
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:08,236
he actually wrote some nasty
things about him in the paper.

399
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:11,372
Okay. So, what does this guy
Bossier do about this slander?

400
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,774
Well, he actually went to find Vernon

401
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,479
in a New Orleans courthouse.

402
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,883
Okay. And he brought a gun,

403
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,086
and he drew his gun,
but Vernon was a faster draw.

404
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,956
Vernon shot Bossier four times

405
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,127
in the hands, face, ribs, and mouth.

406
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,930
Okay. Does he die?

407
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:32,698
12 days later, he died,
leaving Frances a widow.

408
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,734
Huh.

409
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,072
This guy who hangs out in this tree

410
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:42,140
[bleep] there's a really bad
pain associated with him.

411
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,643
And then I am feeling like
something hit me here.

412
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,910
I got to just kind of let this go

413
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,944
'cause it's really kind of
messing me up a little bit.

414
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:54,918
I'm trying to learn more
about the man in the tree

415
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,888
who's attached himself to
a living male in the house,

416
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,160
but all I'm getting is intense
pain in the back of my head.

417
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,733
And then I hear a gunshot
right next to my ear,

418
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,836
and that's how he died.

419
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,405
I don't know if it's self-inflicted

420
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,906
or if he was shot in the head.

421
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,475
God [bleep]

422
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,247
This [bleep] hurts.

423
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,517
I can't even concentrate.

424
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,011
This guy Joseph Bossier
sounds like a real loose cannon,

425
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,243
and I want to know if
there's more to his story.

426
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:40,944
But I've actually managed

427
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:43,113
to track down one of his descendants

428
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:45,780
who says his life was so wild,
it could be made into a movie.

429
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,990
So, Rene, the reason I contacted you

430
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,890
was I did an interview about
the first owners of the property

431
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,292
I'm investigating,
and Joseph Bossier came up.

432
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,960
Now, you're related to him.

433
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:04,430
I am.

434
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,863
I am his fifth great-granddaughter.

435
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,997
- This is him?
- That's him.

436
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:11,268
So eventually he winds up with
the property I'm investigating.

437
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,003
But before that, what do you know about him?

438
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:16,142
Well, he was in the Navy when he was 11.

439
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,280
He got kicked out because
he stole something.

440
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:21,184
Then he was in the Army when he turned 12.

441
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,482
I don't know why he was
discharged from the Army

442
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:25,084
- at age 12.
- Okay.

443
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:28,055
Then he became a mercenary for
several different countries...

444
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:30,556
France, Russia, Spain, Britain, Egypt.

445
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,957
Wow.

446
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,893
I bet even his time overseas
wasn't gonna be a quiet one.

447
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,029
No. In the British Navy, as a mercenary,

448
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:39,365
he was accused of drowning a crew member.

449
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:42,132
Then he built a ship.

450
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,334
- He did?
- Yeah.

451
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,038
He played pirate.

452
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,538
Pirate?

453
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,839
Where did he do that?

454
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:49,474
Right out here in New Orleans.

455
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,510
When you say he played pirate,
did he actually rob people?

456
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:52,579
No.

457
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,284
He would see other ships out in the Gulf,

458
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,654
and he would know that
they were his friends.

459
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:58,788
Okay.

460
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,356
So he would raise the skull and crossbones,

461
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:01,890
and he would board their ship.

462
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:03,928
So, he was just out in
the water, playing...

463
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,561
Except for one time.

464
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:06,895
What happened?

465
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:10,666
Well, he thought it was his
friend when he boarded the ship,

466
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,367
but it wasn't who he thought it was.

467
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,536
Him and his crew member got beaten

468
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,039
within an inch of their life.

469
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,273
Wow.

470
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:20,174
- Does he ever get charged with anything?
- No.

471
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:22,476
He ends up suing the captain

472
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:24,177
for damages to his health and reputation.

473
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,579
Okay.

474
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:28,215
This guy was really something else.

475
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:37,022
There's something with military here.

476
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:39,593
Something.

477
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,730
This guy who hangs out in a tree,

478
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:49,200
he was in the military.

479
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,271
Yeah. He got twisted in the head.

480
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:55,605
Yeah, he did. He got real [bleep] up.

481
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:59,176
He's saying to me that, you know,

482
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:06,250
a lot of things that he
did was due to his head,

483
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:11,355
being, you know, messed up.

484
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:15,696
Do you know when this is from?

485
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,500
This is...

486
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,678
You know, he's not denying that
a part of him didn't like it.

487
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,014
You know, a part of him liked it,

488
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,914
but he's saying,

489
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:36,318
"I saw a lot of horrible things,
and it ruined me.

490
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,183
It ruined me."

491
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:45,221
So far, I know the original
owner of my client's land

492
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:48,357
was a reckless mercenary
who wound up murdered.

493
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,957
But I need to see if there's anything
else that could help my case.

494
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,095
Searching through old records,

495
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:59,335
I find a man named Frank Lenel,
who killed himself.

496
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:03,239
But the reasons are unclear.

497
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:06,278
So I've asked a local
archivist to meet me here.

498
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,882
He says the tragedies this man
suffered could help my case.

499
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,523
So, Bill,
I found that article about this guy Lenel

500
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:16,858
that killed himself.

501
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,064
Do you know how he came
about being on the property?

502
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:23,403
Frank married Louisa Schultz in 1858.

503
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,538
And a year later, her father died,

504
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,376
and she inherited hundreds
of acres of property.

505
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:29,813
And the house was on that property.

506
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,481
Okay. So, now, the article said it was 1880

507
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,748
when he killed himself.

508
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,916
So, what happens before that? I mean...

509
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:37,020
He and Louisa had about six children,

510
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:40,723
and then, unfortunately, in 1871, she died.

511
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,561
She was 36 years old.

512
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:44,329
Okay. So she's young when she died.

513
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,796
Do we know what she died of?

514
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:47,530
No, we weren't able to find that.

515
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:49,231
Then, the next year,

516
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,503
he remarries a woman by the
name of Elizabeth Davis.

517
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:55,038
That was in 1872.

518
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,941
The area was building up quite a bit.

519
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:01,747
And because of the trains coming
in and the population expansion,

520
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:04,983
he decided, as an entrepreneur,
to open a hotel,

521
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:07,118
which he was able to do in 1880.

522
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,817
That's the same year he kills himself.

523
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,318
Correct.

524
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,553
Now, you would think opening up
a hotel would be a good thing.

525
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:13,621
You would think so,

526
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,890
but three months before he opened the hotel,

527
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,326
his second wife died of unknown causes.

528
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,761
She was 43 years old.

529
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:20,997
Wow.

530
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,067
Did he live long enough
to see the hotel open?

531
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,172
Well, he did open the hotel successfully,

532
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:28,173
and it was a month later
that he killed himself.

533
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,110
In fact, he was found in the woods

534
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:34,414
about a mile and a quarter from the hotel.

535
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:37,253
And at the coroner's inquest,
they determined

536
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:41,094
that he had shot himself with
a pistol through the chin,

537
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:42,261
into the brain.

538
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:43,864
Okay.

539
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,472
During my walk,
I saw a dead man in the trees.

540
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,441
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

541
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:57,743
to draw him as he appeared in life.

542
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:00,378
He was in his 40s.

543
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,812
He mouth is kind of feminine-looking,

544
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:06,984
and his hair is slicked back.

545
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:09,284
Next, I describe the disturbing scene

546
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,519
I witnessed in a little girl's room.

547
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,389
There was a dead woman.

548
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:18,760
And behind the child, there was this thing.

549
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:24,000
And it has wings, like,
almost encasing his body.

550
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,342
Amy, is this what you saw?

551
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:36,214
Yes, that's what I saw.

552
00:27:57,263 --> 00:28:00,229
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

553
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:02,698
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

554
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,203
and our clients for the first time.

555
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:08,738
Now, Amy,
I want you to meet Rhonda and Scott.

556
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,310
Rhonda lives in the house with
her three beautiful young kids.

557
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:18,342
Scott is their father
and Rhonda's ex-husband.

558
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,543
He lived in the house for a while,

559
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:22,947
and you've been out for
about three years now?

560
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:24,916
But he's a skeptic,
and Rhonda wanted him here

561
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,150
just so he could know the
hell that she's going through

562
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:28,683
with the kids.

563
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,551
Now, you asked me to not
hold the reveal in the house.

564
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,752
And that's the first time
you've ever done that,

565
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,485
so I'm curious as to why.

566
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:39,750
Well, there's a lot going on there.

567
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:45,616
And I personally felt that
I was physically in danger.

568
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:50,754
During my walk, there was this man

569
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:55,292
who was up in a tree,

570
00:28:55,294 --> 00:29:00,496
and what he was doing,
basically, was watching people.

571
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:01,965
It was disturbing.

572
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,870
He was saying that he had attached himself

573
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:08,174
to a male in the house,

574
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:13,380
that he felt like this person
was a kindred spirit to him

575
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,417
and that he really enjoyed this

576
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,888
because he had been lonely for so long.

577
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,826
Now, these guys built the house in 2004,

578
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,465
and Scott's the only guy
that lived in the house.

579
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:24,466
Mm-hmm.

580
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,866
Now, I got to ask you a question.

581
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:29,036
If this guy attached himself to Scott,
let's say,

582
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,135
would it change his behavior?

583
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,869
It's possible.

584
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,632
The whole time
we were living there,

585
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,598
everything about his
personality was different.

586
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,866
And so was it anger?

587
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:43,436
Yes, with everybody.

588
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,905
My personality did
change while in the house,

589
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:47,873
and particularly toward the end there,

590
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,874
I mean, I was getting really aggressive.

591
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:52,740
And I think that contributed to,
probably, the final breakup.

592
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,581
Now, did you get anything about this guy,

593
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,650
who he might have been when he was alive?

594
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:01,084
What I was able to get from this individual

595
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,018
was something about the military.

596
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,256
I believe he was in the military.

597
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:09,594
And what he said was that when
he went into the military,

598
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:12,965
he saw a lot of things that disturbed him.

599
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,833
So he admits that he got a
little messed up in the head

600
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:18,502
from this whole experience.

601
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:22,140
Then I heard the gunshot by my ear

602
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:24,842
and was obviously feeling this pain.

603
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:29,679
What he looked like, in his death state,

604
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:32,053
was a disaster.

605
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,153
There was a couple guys on your property,

606
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:38,089
going back with the history,
that died from gunshot wounds.

607
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,359
There's one guy in particular,

608
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:41,829
what she's describing makes me think of.

609
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:45,001
His name was Joseph Bossier and his wife,
Frances,

610
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:46,769
were the two first recorded
owners of the property

611
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:48,336
you guys live on.

612
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,272
You mentioned this guy was in the military,
right?

613
00:30:50,274 --> 00:30:51,641
- Yeah.
- Okay.

614
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,342
So now, in 1814, at the age of 11,
he joins the Navy.

615
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:55,778
Geez.

616
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,379
But he was discharged for theft.

617
00:30:57,381 --> 00:30:59,713
1815, he joins the Army.

618
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:03,280
This time,
he was discharged for unknown reasons.

619
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,247
His involvement in the
military doesn't stop there.

620
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:09,720
Between the years of 1816 and 1823,

621
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:13,123
he served as a mercenary in
five different navies in Europe.

622
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,391
- No way.
- Yeah.

623
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:17,959
He served in France, Egypt,
Russia, Britain, and Spain.

624
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,760
Now, he got thrown out of the British Navy

625
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:24,329
because he was accused of
drowning another crew member.

626
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:27,698
Now, you said this guy
died from a gunshot wound.

627
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,637
In 1859, Bossier gets into a nasty dispute

628
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,871
with a business partner of his,
who was a guy named J.M. Vernon.

629
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:36,506
He was also a newspaper editor.

630
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:39,677
Now, Vernon printed some pretty nasty,
disparaging things

631
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,178
about Bossier,

632
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,682
so Bossier found out that he was
gonna be at a courthouse one day,

633
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:47,389
and he decided to go down there
and confront him about this

634
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:48,459
with a gun.

635
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,862
Vernon, actually, was a quicker draw

636
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:53,398
and pulled out his gun
and shot him four times...

637
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,502
the hand, the mouth, the
face, and the ribs.

638
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:59,004
Take a look at the guy's portrait.

639
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:01,640
That's Joseph Bossier.

640
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:05,812
So, is this who you think
you might have seen?

641
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,949
Well, I did a sketch of the person I saw.

642
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:16,824
Wow.

643
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,660
That's the sketch.

644
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:27,265
Now look at the portrait.

645
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:33,572
Looks like the same guy.

646
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,875
It's about as good a sketch and
a portrait as you're gonna get.

647
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:43,921
Unfortunately,
he felt that you guys were kind of similar,

648
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:45,223
which is kind of weird.

649
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,393
My personality and his personality

650
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,195
- were like kindred spirits?
- Yeah.

651
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:50,897
I got to be honest with you.

652
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,831
When I spoke to your ex-wife,
she made it sound like

653
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,499
you were pretty reckless on certain things.

654
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,735
Oh, yeah. I've been notorious.

655
00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:59,505
As far as what?

656
00:32:59,507 --> 00:33:02,509
Making decisions that just made
my life a lot more difficult

657
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,677
if I would have made the right decisions.

658
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:12,382
How did the rest of the walk go?

659
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:16,586
So then I went upstairs,
and I met this old lady

660
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:23,357
that she has a very strong sense
of ownership over the house.

661
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,956
I think at one point that
she owned the property.

662
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,524
But for whatever reason,

663
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,295
she's honed in on your house specifically.

664
00:33:30,297 --> 00:33:33,161
While she was alive,
she was [bleep] about her family.

665
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:36,829
So she came from a very
dysfunctional family.

666
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,232
She did indicate that she was wealthy,

667
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,964
and I just felt, like,
a sense of isolation.

668
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:45,467
Like, I do think that she really
just pushed everybody away

669
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:47,569
because of her attitude problem.

670
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:50,105
Some of what you're
saying could be his wife

671
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:53,408
because she did come from wealth.

672
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,914
Now, her name was Frances Bossier.

673
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,350
She inherited the 100 acres
that your house sits on.

674
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:03,188
This is actually the
deed for her 100 acres.

675
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,992
She actually even sued to
get his name off the deed

676
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:07,794
'cause he was so reckless with money.

677
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,894
Surprisingly, they stayed married, though.

678
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,396
Interesting.

679
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,807
So, does the woman do
anything to the living

680
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,575
- that are in the house?
- Yes.

681
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:22,212
She has a very big problem with you.

682
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:25,117
She admitted that she was physical

683
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,718
and that she was trying
to drive you insane.

684
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:33,821
What about the physical stuff?
What are we talking about?

685
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,958
She said beating, like hitting.

686
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,792
So I thought, you know, she's beating.

687
00:34:37,794 --> 00:34:40,758
I don't know. Hitting, pinching, shoving.

688
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,195
Well, Rhonda and her daughter
have gotten physical injuries.

689
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,229
They get scratches.

690
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,667
Okay. That's not good.

691
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:56,406
The one physical thing that
she showed me that she did

692
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:59,075
was she would literally sit on you.

693
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,476
Oh, my God.

694
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,747
I felt somebody crawl on the bed
before and, like, sit on it.

695
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:05,515
- Mm-hmm.
- And the bed went down.

696
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:11,120
Okay, okay. This is really bad.

697
00:35:13,557 --> 00:35:16,728
During my walk, I got that a living woman

698
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,535
was getting very sick from
being exposed to the dead.

699
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,806
I got that it had been going on a few years

700
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:26,207
and that it had incapacitated this person

701
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:30,143
and that there had been
several hospital visits.

702
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:34,750
I've been sick every day
for almost 11 years now.

703
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:40,726
Nobody knows what happened to me,
why I'm in pain.

704
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:43,297
I'm incapacitated.
I'll be in bed for weeks at a time.

705
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:49,032
It's...
it's taken over my life and ruined it.

706
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,334
You got a lot going on so far.

707
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:55,402
But I know that wasn't the
finish of your walk, was it?

708
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,837
No.

709
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,074
How much more can we take?

710
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:03,075
So after I left the master bedroom,

711
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:08,481
I went down the hallway where the kids'
rooms are.

712
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:14,420
And I saw a little girl sitting
cross-legged on the floor,

713
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,090
talking to the dead lady.

714
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,161
And I tried to go in the room.

715
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,331
I couldn't go in the room.

716
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,999
And that's never happened before.

717
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:29,904
And then I saw this thing that
I have never seen with a kid.

718
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:33,207
And that really bothered me.

719
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,446
It can take on different forms.

720
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:38,515
You know, it can be short or tall.

721
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:40,983
It can take on an animal-like form.

722
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:44,586
The one feature that it consistently has

723
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,520
is these wings,

724
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:49,724
but they're not fully formed.

725
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,859
Well, this gave me a little bit of a chill,
which I never get.

726
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:54,295
And the only reason I got
a little chill from it

727
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,361
is because when I interviewed Scarlett,

728
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:57,761
she described seeing a woman

729
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:01,965
and this creepy,
scaly thing that was crouched down.

730
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:07,003
And she said it was almost like an alien

731
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,172
but with scales and stuff.

732
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:11,874
She ever mention that to you?

733
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,612
She told me she's seeing
things in the playroom

734
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:16,311
that look like aliens.

735
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:22,018
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

736
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:34,933
Just be prepared for what you're gonna see.

737
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,902
God.

738
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,345
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

739
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,647
Just be prepared for what you're gonna see.

740
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,649
God.

741
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:16,661
Gilby sees this and Scarlett.

742
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:21,068
I never want that to happen again.

743
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:27,974
Never want my children
to experience that again.

744
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:31,377
I almost get a feeling it's
like the angel of death.

745
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,113
Oh, no. This is no angel.

746
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:37,749
Well, it was interesting you said
"like the angel of death."

747
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,051
It's not death.

748
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:42,388
For lack of a better term,

749
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,790
I guess you would call
them demons and devils.

750
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,092
But they're not that.

751
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,263
They're worse.

752
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:53,332
And when I've seen it,
it's been with drug addicts,

753
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:57,866
alcoholics, you know, severe addictions.

754
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:03,672
So to see it with a child
was utterly bizarre.

755
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,745
This sucker is really evil.

756
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:09,648
They don't instigate the addiction.

757
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,587
It comes when the person's in
the throes of an addiction,

758
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:19,689
and it pushes them over the
edge and leads them to death.

759
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,258
And then it keeps their soul.

760
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,291
And it tortures them for eternity.

761
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,528
I've had a problem with drug addictions.

762
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:34,536
Well, more than likely,
you brought it into the house.

763
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,474
So I'm thinking,
if you got out of your addiction,

764
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,610
maybe he's pissed.

765
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,479
Mm.

766
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,881
He didn't get you.

767
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:43,983
And then he saw something easier.

768
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:51,123
I'm in pain a lot, so I take medicine now,

769
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,791
but I'm not addicted to medicine.

770
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,393
Okay.

771
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:58,432
The problem is,
this thing wants you to become to addicted.

772
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,808
Well, we've had some disturbing
and upsetting reveals before

773
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,544
but, honestly, nothing quite like this.

774
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:12,412
And, Rhonda, I'm so sorry that
this happened in your house.

775
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:13,412
I really am.

776
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:14,980
But now we're gonna find out

777
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:17,049
if there's anything you can do about it.

778
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:20,389
And I'm hoping Amy has an answer for you.

779
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,096
You do need to get a medium

780
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:32,504
and cleanse your house of
the dead that are there

781
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:36,675
and seal your property so
the dead cannot come back in.

782
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:40,580
But as far as this thing goes,

783
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:45,186
the only solution that
there is is in your hands.

784
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,728
It's not something that
somebody can come in

785
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,498
and take care of for you.

786
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:58,005
Not a lot of people get this warning,

787
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:01,143
and that's exactly what
this is is a warning.

788
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:06,146
These are the three reasons
that this needs to stop.

789
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:11,449
I mean, this thing, it kills people.

790
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:17,821
I want it away from us.

791
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:24,694
If I can change whatever's causing the pain

792
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:27,662
and then start to get healthy again,

793
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,464
get off the medication.

794
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:34,562
It's gonna take some work.
We've got some work to do.

795
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,864
You think you're gonna
be able to handle this?

796
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:39,731
Mm-hmm.

797
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:42,466
I'll get it done.

798
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:44,469
Whatever I need to do,
I'll take care of it.

799
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:48,706
I really feel for Rhonda,

800
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:52,844
as the entities terrorizing her
family present a serious danger.

801
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:56,579
But I believe if she cleanses
her house of all the dead

802
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:59,848
and never feeds this demon
what it's looking for,

803
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,553
she and her family should live in peace.
