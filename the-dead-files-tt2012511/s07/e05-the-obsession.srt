1
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,094
They scare the people.
They scare them so bad.

2
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:16,696
Activity has spiked here.

3
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,202
It's higher than it's been in a long time.

4
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,949
They're trapped.

5
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:23,090
Now they're gonna be tortured.

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,364
What was her cause of death?

7
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,403
One gunshot wound through
the base of the skull.

8
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,278
I feel like hurting people.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,688
I want you to find out who killed Mary Jane.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,897
People have done very bad things

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,943
after they've left this place.

12
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,615
Something bad's going to happen.

13
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,519
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,887
There's panic.

15
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:47,322
And it's almost like a butchering.

16
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:48,397
I see dead people.

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,538
They all died horribly.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,243
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:53,654
Get out of here.

20
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:55,289
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,325
Vicious.

22
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:00,470
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:02,172
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

24
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,740
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,375
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:07,278
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,983
This guy's a real piece of work.

28
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,659
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,162
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

30
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,332
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:17,605
This is not good.

32
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:19,343
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,381
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,149
Until the very end...

35
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,619
I want my life back.

36
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,857
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,661
Is he trying to kill her?

38
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:29,930
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:31,435
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:33,140
This is going to kill us.

41
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,980
I'm in Oregon, Illinois,
about 100 miles west of Chicago.

42
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:53,352
I got a call from a former mayor of the town

43
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:54,856
who owns a restaurant there.

44
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,692
He told me his place is haunted,

45
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:59,264
and that his employees
and customers are scared,

46
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,403
but that's not what caught my attention

47
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:02,638
about this case.

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,876
He thinks the place is being haunted

49
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:07,881
by an unsolved murder that
happened many years ago.

50
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:09,648
Now, I'm not sure about all that,

51
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,384
but he sounded pretty desperate,

52
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,254
and I'm hoping we can help him out.

53
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,203
Before Amy arrives,

54
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,340
I need to make sure photos, paintings,

55
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:26,077
and anything else that
could influence her findings

56
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,713
are covered or removed.

57
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,013
When I'm finished,

58
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,085
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

59
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,930
Okay.

60
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,105
Mm.

61
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,275
This place makes you feel

62
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:57,249
like someone's just come up
and punched you in the stomach.

63
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:02,358
You know, like,
you're getting the air knocked out of you,

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,394
and you want to just vomit.

65
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:11,733
That's kind of how it feels here.

66
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:14,202
I would just get out of here, you know?

67
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:17,270
There's no hope here.

68
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:29,178
So, Mike,
one of the things we spoke about on the phone

69
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,816
was how intense the activity
has gotten in this place.

70
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,517
Give me a rundown what the hell's going on.

71
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,954
Noises, things flying across the room,

72
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:40,624
shadow figures, people being touched.

73
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,992
We've had customers
actually get up and leave.

74
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:45,127
Okay, are you losing business, you think,

75
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,498
because of some of this
stuff that's going on?

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,266
Of course, it's gone down.

77
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:51,168
It's not what it used to be.

78
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,269
- I understand you're a former mayor.
- Correct.

79
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,072
What year was that?

80
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:58,045
That was from 1999 to 2003.

81
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,146
When did you buy this place?

82
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:03,982
I bought the place in 1993.

83
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,051
Okay, so was it a bar and restaurant

84
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:07,152
when you bought it?

85
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:08,787
No, it was in a shambles.

86
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,420
Matter of fact,
here's a picture of the place.

87
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,021
It was condemned.

88
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,760
So, you have this place over 20 years.

89
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,526
Why are you calling us now?

90
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,992
Activity has spiked here.

91
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,494
It's higher than it's been in a long time.

92
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,062
Did anything change?

93
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,895
I moved in here a few years ago, okay,

94
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,995
and I guess I've just
become more aware of it

95
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:32,867
being here 24/7 instead
of just 10 hours a day.

96
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,302
You mentioned that you have a theory

97
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,903
about who you think is haunting this place.

98
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,571
It dates back to 1948.

99
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,106
Mary Jane Reed and her date.

100
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,976
They spent their last night alive

101
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:43,978
in this building.

102
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:48,245
- This is Mary Jane Reed?
- Correct.

103
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:54,521
I made it my mission to solve this murder.

104
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,432
Is there a cold case unit
working on this currently?

105
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:58,183
No.

106
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,631
You're the cold case unit working on it?

107
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,232
I had the gal's body exhumed.

108
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,838
I've dropped probably $150,000 on it

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,272
over the past 15 years.

110
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,107
On looking into this case?

111
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:14,843
Correct.

112
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:18,143
I mean, is that part of the
reason you're living here now?

113
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,746
It's the reason I don't
have a house anymore.

114
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,182
I'm living here, yes.

115
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,015
Why are you spending this
kind of money on a case

116
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:24,346
that's got nothing to do with you?

117
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,249
Because the family needs closure.

118
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,983
Her spirit needs closure.

119
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:32,714
So, Mike, I got to ask you,
what makes you think

120
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:35,483
that it's Mary Jane Reed that's here?

121
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,616
If I'm not doing anything,

122
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:40,586
or if I'm letting my efforts slide,

123
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,653
the paranormal activity here spikes.

124
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,088
I can't let it go.

125
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,624
So,
I've got a client who's so positive

126
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,760
he knows who's haunting his property,

127
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,761
he's literally spent his life savings

128
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:52,994
trying to solve a crime

129
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,395
he thinks will put the
victim's spirit to rest.

130
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,496
He's even had one of the victims' bodies

131
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,498
exhumed and re-examined by a coroner,

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,499
and trust me,
that's no easy thing to have done.

133
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,969
This case is gonna be an unusual one.

134
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:09,844
There's a woman.

135
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:14,349
She looks young, maybe 20s.

136
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:18,251
Really... nasty.

137
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,421
She is something.

138
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,591
Very physical, very solid.

139
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:29,399
She can really do

140
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:33,671
a lot of harm to people physically.

141
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,311
I would assume that people would see her.

142
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:41,351
She likes to sit by people.
That's a big thing for her.

143
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:43,487
But it's very unnerving.

144
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,859
She's just wicked.

145
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,899
What's going on in this area here?

146
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:57,569
Well, it was in the lounge area

147
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:00,671
that I saw this apparition
of this young girl.

148
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,642
That was like the third time

149
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,477
that she'd been in the building.

150
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,780
Saw her go out the front door.

151
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:10,052
I was maybe seven seconds behind her,

152
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,789
and by the time I got to the doorway

153
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,024
and looked the other way, she was gone.

154
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,561
You're sure it wasn't a real person, then?

155
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,331
It sure looked like a real person to me,

156
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,433
but how she disappeared
after she got out the door

157
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,368
when I followed her out,
I don't have a clue.

158
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,103
You think it's this girl, Mary Jane?

159
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,371
I'm thinking that it almost had to be.

160
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,439
Is there anything else you've seen?

161
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,473
The shadows.

162
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,942
You see them out of the corner of your eye,

163
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:34,443
and you turn your head, and they're gone.

164
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,645
There's no shadows.

165
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,281
You think you see something,

166
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,917
or you feel like you're being watched.

167
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,485
Okay, now, there's a lot of people

168
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,020
that are in and out of this place.

169
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,689
Are you sure it's not being reflected

170
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:46,291
by another person or living person?

171
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:48,193
I don't typically see those when we're open.

172
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,663
I mean,
if I thought that there was someone around,

173
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:52,866
and that's what it was,
I wouldn't have even brought it up.

174
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,873
There are these things
really just everywhere.

175
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:05,613
I don't like being here because
I feel this is something

176
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,115
that can affect the living very easily.

177
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:10,985
Can you describe these things?

178
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,924
They're three-dimensional.

179
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,392
Living people see this dark thing

180
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,361
standing in the doorway.

181
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:24,737
A dark presence, but it's solid.

182
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,939
Instead of seeing an open doorway,

183
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,774
there's like a solid darkness.

184
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,190
It's worse in here.

185
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:43,894
It's so [bleep] bad.

186
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,334
This place...

187
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,034
just destroys.

188
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,740
It's so dangerous.

189
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:03,014
It's hard to focus on, really, anything.

190
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:10,455
I... I don't understand
how these things came here.

191
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:15,390
It has its roots in Satanism.

192
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:19,994
It has to do with religion,

193
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:23,432
but there's nothing religion can do to help.

194
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,001
Do you know where it came from?

195
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:29,307
Well, like, Hell, you know?

196
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,812
They're from Hell.

197
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,950
Something was off
when I started interviewing

198
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,586
the employees of Mike's restaurant.

199
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,123
Okay, what did you see?

200
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,824
Maybe a black figure, I don't know.

201
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,760
As I asked them about their experiences,

202
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,229
I got the feeling they were
keeping something from me.

203
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,163
There's something that creeps me out here

204
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,798
that I cannot explain.

205
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,033
Like what?

206
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,734
Just all kinds of stuff.

207
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,934
And with over 20 years in law enforcement,

208
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:09,202
I know when I'm not getting a clear answer.

209
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:10,803
How long did this last?

210
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,140
I can't really tell you.

211
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,711
You think whatever's here is good or bad?

212
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:18,144
I... I have no idea.

213
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,146
Finally, I had enough.

214
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,417
It's a little frustrating,
I got to be honest with you.

215
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,654
Sounds like something that you
guys discussed ahead of time

216
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,057
how you were gonna answer things.

217
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,130
When everybody I'm talking
to is that same way,

218
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,633
it's a pattern, and it just, you know,

219
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:35,202
tells me that something's not right here.

220
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,947
Like, right now,

221
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,884
it literally feels like
my mind is being erased.

222
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:53,121
That's what happens to people here.

223
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:54,756
They're trying to make it

224
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,127
so like I can't figure things out.

225
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,431
Those things... you know,
I'm not gonna call 'em demons

226
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,100
'cause they're not demons.

227
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:08,202
They said "legions."

228
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:11,709
I don't know what that means.

229
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:14,979
Something or someone
is trying to confuse me.

230
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,815
I'm hearing that there are
legions of demons here,

231
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:20,152
but that doesn't seem right.

232
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:22,422
I feel like there are dead people here

233
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,757
who want to talk to me, but they can't.

234
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,995
I'm feeling them reaching out.

235
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,733
These things are standing between us.

236
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,403
I feel like I want to scream, I want to cry,

237
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,309
like I want to do all these things,
and I can't.

238
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:43,112
I'm feeling what the living here feel.

239
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,947
It feels like terror.

240
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,085
So, what about experiences
that you can't explain

241
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,487
while you've been working here.

242
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,755
- Have you had any?
- Yes.

243
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,490
Okay, tell me about some of them.

244
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,359
Yeah, I've seen shadow figures.

245
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,528
That's the only way I can describe it.

246
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,997
Okay, how often?

247
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,301
Probably five times, at least.

248
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:09,004
So, when you see this shadow thing,

249
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,220
you sure it's not a reflection
of a shadow of somebody?

250
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:11,774
No.

251
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:15,181
- How are you so sure?
- No, I... how could it be a reflection?

252
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,014
I mean, there was nobody here.

253
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,916
Are you uncomfortable working here?

254
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:23,323
I'm not, in the building itself, but...

255
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,992
there's something that's
following me home now.

256
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,698
I'm wondering if it's the bad energy,

257
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,100
and he doesn't like

258
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:33,969
that we're talking about all
this and stirring things up.

259
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,972
About three or four weeks ago,

260
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:40,141
about 3:00 in the morning,
I was sound asleep,

261
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,844
and the end of my bed...

262
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,549
Pretend like this is the bed, right?

263
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,316
And here's my bedspread.

264
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:48,449
We're talking a heavy comforter.

265
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:52,120
It was clawing like this, like this,

266
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:56,023
and then it took it and went like this.

267
00:12:56,825 --> 00:13:00,428
Scared me to death.

268
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,097
I said it out loud,

269
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,700
"[Bleep], get the [bleep] out of my house."

270
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,637
- Do you have animals in the house?
- No animals.

271
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,995
- Okay, that had to scare
the hell out of you. - It did.

272
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,071
Feel me.

273
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,774
Yeah, you are. You're shaking.

274
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,409
Yeah, I'm shaking.

275
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:19,613
I don't want to cry,
but I'm not sleeping well,

276
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,351
and I'll thank you if
I can get some answers.

277
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:23,719
I just want it to stop.

278
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:30,028
Sometimes these dark things that are here

279
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,096
will leave with people.

280
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:34,998
They'll stay with them,
or they come back?

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,901
I don't feel like they come back.

282
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,536
I do feel like they stay with them.

283
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:42,490
Can they do anything
physical to the living?

284
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:43,807
Yes, it...

285
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,112
You know, I think people can be harmed.

286
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:50,649
I think people could become possessed.

287
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:55,156
Suggestions being put into people's minds.

288
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:59,964
This is how they influence, whispering...

289
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,702
Into your mind,

290
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:09,708
making you do bad things to people.

291
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,408
I feel like doing bad things.

292
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,144
I feel like hurting people.

293
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:20,218
Living people have done very bad things

294
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,685
after they've left this place.

295
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,018
Do you know what they want?

296
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,725
Chaos and destruction.

297
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,652
Mike is obsessed with
this Mary Jane Reed murder case,

298
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:52,156
and he wanted to show me
all the evidence he found.

299
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,625
But honestly,
I don't trust civilian investigators.

300
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,494
So, I called on a pro, a retired detective

301
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,530
who has the case file and
is gonna walk me through it.

302
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,688
So, Bill,
I want to start out with a clean slate.

303
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,753
What do you know about this case?

304
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,425
Stanley Skridla. Here's a picture of him.

305
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,857
He's a former Navy Seabee.

306
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,983
June 24, 1948,

307
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,453
he meets up with this young girl,
Mary Jane Reed,

308
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:28,622
and they set up to go on a date.

309
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,724
- Okay.
- And they end up at this place

310
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:33,231
called Alexander's Log Cabin Inn,

311
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,165
- which is a bar.
- Okay.

312
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,567
They meet up with a deputy sheriff

313
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,871
by the name of Willard Burright,

314
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,406
better known as "Jiggs"

315
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,045
to most of the people around the area.

316
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,248
He's a 42-year-old married man,

317
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,350
and it's rumored that

318
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:52,455
he's having an affair with Mary Jane.

319
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,026
Okay, if that's the case,

320
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:56,264
and she walks in with a young guy...

321
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,133
The deputy sheriff walks up to them,

322
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,232
and he wants Mary Jane to leave with him.

323
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,534
And she refuses.

324
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,505
They end up in this big argument,

325
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,541
and she ends up slapping the deputy

326
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:10,244
and then leaves out of there with Skridla.

327
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,111
Okay, so what happens next?

328
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:14,412
They end up at your client's property,

329
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,017
which was called the Stenhouse back then.

330
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,486
They were gonna go inside,

331
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:19,987
but according to witnesses,

332
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,454
Stanley gets out of the car,

333
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,588
but all of a sudden,

334
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,324
he stops and gets back in his car,

335
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:25,592
and they drive off,

336
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:29,361
and that's the last time
that anybody saw them alive.

337
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,541
There's people down here.

338
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,212
Who?

339
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:53,652
There's a man and this woman.

340
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:56,855
Two, maybe three people.

341
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:03,931
Female has brown, curly hair.

342
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,802
She's wearing a dress.

343
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:10,274
I'm hearing she's up to no good.

344
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:14,516
They look scared.

345
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,688
I do feel like there was a female victim,

346
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,127
but I also feel like there's a male victim.

347
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:28,433
Her and this man knew each other,

348
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,770
possibly killed either at the same time

349
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,035
or very [bleep] close.

350
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,275
When they left the Stenhouse,

351
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:39,811
they left somewhere just before midnight,

352
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:43,279
and witnesses said that
they were being followed

353
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,881
by an older model car

354
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,518
with two pretty good-sized guys in there.

355
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,656
And they went to a very
popular make-out area

356
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,558
called Lover's Lane.

357
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,493
Okay.

358
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:59,196
Stanley's body was actually
found there the next morning,

359
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:01,133
- lying in a ditch.
- Really?

360
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:03,938
I have a picture here of the crime scene.

361
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,442
And what was his cause of death?

362
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,776
Multiple gunshot wounds

363
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:12,348
- to his abdomen, his chest...
- Geez.

364
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,150
His groin, his arm.

365
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,787
But there was another report that indicated

366
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:19,359
that he had one gunshot wound to his back.

367
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,630
Okay, where's Mary Jane?

368
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:25,233
Mary Jane's body was found four days later,

369
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:30,339
and she's about a mile away
from where Skridla was found.

370
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:34,009
- Okay.
- This is a picture of her crime scene.

371
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,679
And what was her cause of death?

372
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:40,047
One gunshot wound through
the base of the skull.

373
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,050
All right, so it sounds like

374
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,786
whoever did these murders killed him first,

375
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,120
and then later on killed her

376
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,855
and then dumped her
body in a different spot.

377
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:51,290
Right.

378
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,827
Somebody's hitting me on the back.

379
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,727
Upper left of my back.

380
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,061
Someone's hitting me there,

381
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,763
hitting me there, hitting me there,

382
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,431
falling down on the ground,

383
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,566
but it's dark.

384
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:06,465
I don't know if it's actually down here.

385
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,566
Might be outside.

386
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:13,706
I think it's like a sneak attack.

387
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,374
Someone hits the... hits
the [bleep] ground.

388
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:20,308
Mm.

389
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,211
There's a lot of pain here.

390
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:27,448
I do feel stabbing-like sensations.

391
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,148
Neck area, chest area, and the back.

392
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,152
It's like sharp pains.

393
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:38,890
I feel this being crushed.

394
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,558
Mm, to the throat.

395
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,962
I think the female's with the neck.

396
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:47,263
I think the male is to the back.

397
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,737
Now,
I know this is an unsolved double homicide,

398
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,902
but was anybody ever charged in this case?

399
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,270
There were no arrests made,

400
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:58,508
but there's two possibilities in this case.

401
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,178
Well, first, there was Jiggs,
the deputy sheriff.

402
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,245
- Okay, for obvious reasons.
- Yes.

403
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,845
Why wasn't he ever charged?

404
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,917
Well, there's a couple
interesting points about that.

405
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,785
He was actually the detective

406
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:12,853
that was heading up the investigation.

407
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,629
Okay, there's a little
conflict of interest there.

408
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:16,323
Yeah.

409
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:19,290
And all the evidence that
was brought out against him

410
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,559
- was strictly circumstantial.
- Okay.

411
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:22,892
Now, what about the two guys

412
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,561
following them out of the parking lot?

413
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,196
Those are the other two suspects.

414
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:29,424
In 1948, a guy by the
name of Harry Deshazo...

415
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:30,230
Okay.

416
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:34,139
Shows up at the sheriff's
office and tries to confess.

417
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,673
Oh. He tells the sheriff's department

418
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:39,842
that he and his brother, Perry,

419
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:44,279
followed them to Lover's Lane
and were going to rob them,

420
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:47,711
but Harry says that this robbery went bad,

421
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,916
and Perry ends up shooting the two victims.

422
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,384
That's interesting.

423
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,719
Why would the sheriff sit on that?

424
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,287
- We don't know.
- Wow.

425
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,123
I don't know if we'll ever know.

426
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:08,263
There's these three people
who might be involved.

427
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,263
With?

428
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,998
This situation,

429
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,701
which is, I think, two men and one woman.

430
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,873
Okay.

431
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,907
Then I'm getting a completely other image

432
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:22,277
of a guy standing with a
double-barrel shotgun...

433
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,583
holding it on someone...

434
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,685
I don't see who...

435
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:32,361
and in a rage.

436
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:35,731
They're trying to

437
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,101
communicate to me what happened.

438
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,412
Oh,

439
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:46,014
You okay?

440
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,417
No, no, no. No, no, no.

441
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,133
Surprisingly, Mary Jane Reed's brother

442
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:11,934
is still alive <i>and</i> living in town,

443
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:15,465
so I reached out to him,
and he agreed to talk to me.

444
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,632
He said his sister's murder

445
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:19,666
ended up destroying their family.

446
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,172
I know it's been a very long time,

447
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:33,955
but my condolences on
your sister's death.

448
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,907
Thank you.

449
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,809
Mary Jane kind of was my pride and joy,

450
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,412
and she took very good care of me.

451
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,416
How did you take it?

452
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,448
Oh, I... I did my share of bawling.

453
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,284
I missed her very much.

454
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:48,954
What about the murder itself?

455
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:51,487
Are you still concerned
about finding out who did it?

456
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:54,723
I really believe it was the sheriff.

457
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:56,862
Jiggs was his name, right?

458
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:59,564
Jiggs Burright, yes.

459
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,102
Every now and then, he would just stop

460
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:05,235
and just sit there in his
car and look over at us.

461
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:07,302
Really?

462
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,103
Did you think he was
obsessed with your sister?

463
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:13,908
Yes, and I also believe that
he was very jealous of her.

464
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,976
Now, why do you say that?

465
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,310
'Cause if she was with someone else,

466
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:20,913
it seemed like he got upset with her.

467
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:26,785
These scary people,

468
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:29,424
it's very difficult for them to come out

469
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:34,195
because there are things

470
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:38,434
that are trying to prevent
that from happening.

471
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:40,537
The problem here is that

472
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:44,678
the dead aren't allowed to speak,

473
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,280
and really, the living aren't, either.

474
00:23:48,282 --> 00:23:55,149
These evil [bleep] are trying
desperately to maintain control,

475
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,284
keeping everybody trapped.

476
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:03,188
Now they're gonna be tortured, see?

477
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,254
What does that mean?

478
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,393
They're... gonna...

479
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,230
make it bad for them.

480
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,733
Do you remember anything

481
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:21,836
about the day you found
out about your sister?

482
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:23,804
Yes, I do, very clear.

483
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,138
I'll never forget it.

484
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,672
I was 6 at the time,

485
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,309
and two detectives came to the house,

486
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,544
and my mother opened the door,

487
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:36,017
and I was standing there with her,
holding her hand.

488
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,386
- Okay.
- They said, "Mrs. Reed,

489
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:40,557
"we got very bad news for you.

490
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,662
We found Mary Jane. She was murdered."

491
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,833
And I felt my mother's knees just weakening.

492
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:53,505
I thought she was gonna fall.

493
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,808
And one of the officers
kind of got a hold of her

494
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,276
and held her up for a while.

495
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,684
Now,
you had mentioned that... on the phone...

496
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:04,654
- things got really bad at home after that.
- Very bad.

497
00:25:04,656 --> 00:25:05,656
What happened?

498
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:07,659
They ended up sending her down

499
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:11,397
to East Moline State Hospital at that time.

500
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,167
She was there over a year.

501
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:15,703
After the year that she was there,

502
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:16,871
did it help her any?

503
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:20,511
She wasn't quite as
nervous as she was prior,

504
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:26,612
but yet... she wasn't herself, either.

505
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:29,414
This is a picture of my father and mother

506
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,548
on their 50th wedding anniversary.

507
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,117
Your mom looks sad in this photo.

508
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,158
So does your father, actually.

509
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,699
Well, see,
I made a promise to her before she died.

510
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:44,272
She looked me in the eye, and she said,

511
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:48,744
"There's one thing I want you to do for me.

512
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:52,883
I want you to find out
who killed Mary Jane."

513
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:57,523
I looked her in the eye,
and I said, "I'll try, mother."

514
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,072
I saw several entities during my walk,

515
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:12,544
but the murdered woman in the basement

516
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:14,146
had me the most concerned.

517
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:17,953
When I initially met her,
she was kind of crouched down.

518
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,892
She's white, darker brown hair.

519
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:26,399
Her face was more round, pretty delicate.

520
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,332
How old would you say she was?

521
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,764
18 to 23.

522
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,801
Is this what you saw?

523
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,804
Yes, that's what I saw.

524
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:02,214
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

525
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,786
we're ready to reveal our findings

526
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,255
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

527
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,789
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Mike.

528
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,491
He owns this place.

529
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:13,326
He's not our typical client for two reasons.

530
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:15,761
One, he used to be the mayor here,

531
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:19,564
and two, he thinks he knows
who's haunting his business.

532
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,498
I mean, as the night goes by,

533
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,899
we'll find out if you're right or not.

534
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:26,167
This is Marge.
She's been working here a long, long time.

535
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,535
Now that the activity's gotten much,
much worse,

536
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:30,338
she's pretty scared for her own safety.

537
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,139
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

538
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:38,175
I'm just gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

539
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,044
I went down into the basement,

540
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:46,254
and I didn't really like
it down there very much.

541
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,889
I felt very unwelcome.

542
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,427
And after a minute,

543
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:57,066
I saw three people hunched down there,

544
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:59,704
and it was two men and one woman.

545
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:02,042
Somehow, they know each other.

546
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:03,744
I don't know how, but there...

547
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,779
there's a familiarity there between them.

548
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:11,149
And she was indicating
that she had been murdered.

549
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,821
And it seemed like she and the man she knew

550
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:20,090
either died at the same time
or very close to each other.

551
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:23,856
She was wearing a nice dress.
It was kind of dusk.

552
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:27,828
Amy,
I got a pretty good idea of what you saw.

553
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,529
It's one of the main reasons we're here.

554
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:32,530
Back in 1948, there was a double homicide.

555
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,898
The victims were Mary Jane Reed

556
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,870
and a guy named Stanley Skridla.

557
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:39,303
This is Mary Jane.

558
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,677
Here's a picture of Stanley.

559
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,783
Stanley was 28 years old. She was 17.

560
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:51,820
Now,
she went on a date with Stanley that night,

561
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:53,288
first time.

562
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,858
The last place they were seen alive

563
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,029
was actually in the parking
lot of this restaurant.

564
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,134
Mike is very fixated on this case.

565
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:02,369
He thinks it's the reason

566
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,171
the restaurant is actually haunted.

567
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:07,641
I've been working on it since 1999

568
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:09,509
when I was elected mayor.

569
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:15,984
I've spent tons of money
and hundreds of hours.

570
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,852
He's actually lost his house over it,

571
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:20,322
- that's how much this case means to him.
- Right.

572
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,758
Now, did you get a good
look of anybody down there?

573
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,459
Yes, I had a sketch done

574
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:28,464
of the female that I saw in the basement.

575
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,066
I got to see this.

576
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:37,572
Wow.

577
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,043
Yeah.

578
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,812
You guys tell me.

579
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,888
That's awful close, Amy.

580
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,894
Look at the cheek line right here,
the eyebrows.

581
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:56,162
It's close enough for me.

582
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:57,864
All right, let me ask you a question.

583
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:59,733
You get any idea of how these people died

584
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:01,234
that were in the basement?

585
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:04,740
I think it happened outside at night.

586
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,908
The female indicated to me

587
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,146
something with the throat area,
very painful.

588
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:13,080
What about the man?

589
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,116
I felt impact in my back.

590
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:18,920
I felt the falling sensation,

591
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,856
hit... my face hitting the gravel,

592
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,226
so it was something, a dirt road.

593
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:25,994
It was like a sneak attack.

594
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,529
They either died together,

595
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:30,433
or they died very close together.

596
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:32,104
Wow.

597
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,040
Dead on.

598
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm very impressed,

599
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,743
Needless to say..

600
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,213
This is the million-dollar question here.

601
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:41,883
Any indication of who
might have killed them?

602
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,184
She kind of indicated that it was two males.

603
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,956
So, this is gonna make a lot
more sense to you, I think,

604
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,289
once I lay out the rest of the evening

605
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:56,029
that Stanley and Mary Jane were killed.

606
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:56,965
Okay.

607
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,798
Stanley picked her up at work.

608
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,266
They went out on the town.

609
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:03,468
They wound up at a tavern called
Alexander's Log Cabin Inn.

610
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,902
They ran into this guy.

611
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,973
I got a photo here of Deputy
Sheriff Willard Burright,

612
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:09,274
also known as "Jiggs."

613
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:12,643
Oh.

614
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,049
Apparently, and this is documented

615
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,051
in police reports from the time

616
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:20,654
that they were having an affair.

617
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:22,789
Jiggs was a 42-year-old married man.

618
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,228
Mary Jane was 17.

619
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,328
Now, when I spoke to Mary Jane's brother,

620
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,496
who is still alive,

621
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:32,166
he was maybe 6 at the time.

622
00:31:32,168 --> 00:31:33,803
He used to see him come by

623
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,338
and just stand outside in the radio car

624
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,406
and stare at her in the backyard.

625
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:41,245
Oh.

626
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:45,416
So, he sees her with Stanley,

627
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:46,985
and he gets upset.

628
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,056
They got into an altercation.

629
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:51,092
She wound up smacking him
'cause he kept saying,

630
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,958
"I want you to come with me, come with me."

631
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,029
She's, like, "No,
leave me alone"... smacks him.

632
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,761
Stanley and Mary Jane leave.

633
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:58,528
Now, the next spot the two of them came to

634
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,863
is this place,
which was known as the Stenhouse back then.

635
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:03,232
They pull up to get into the parking lot.

636
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:06,836
Stanley gets out, and for some reason,

637
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:10,338
he gets back in and takes off.

638
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,708
We don't know if something spooked him.

639
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,011
According to witnesses,

640
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:15,414
they said they were followed
by two big guys in a car.

641
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:18,183
There's a place called Lover's Lane

642
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,318
like most towns have.

643
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,289
It's about a mile from here.

644
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:24,157
Next morning,
they find Stanley's body facedown.

645
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,658
He was shot four times...

646
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,430
three in the front, one in the back.

647
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:32,665
That's Stanley's death certificate here.

648
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,702
Now, four days later,

649
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:39,843
Mary Jane's body was found
about a mile away in a ditch.

650
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,444
Now, when she's found,

651
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:44,344
she's found with a single gunshot wound

652
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,513
to the back of the head.

653
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,482
Now, I got her death certificate here.

654
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,084
Now,
here's where it gets really interesting.

655
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,954
About 10 years ago,
Mike had the body exhumed.

656
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:55,423
Okay.

657
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:57,422
He was hoping to find some
clues about the murder.

658
00:32:57,424 --> 00:32:59,957
Now, you said you thought
she suffered a neck injury.

659
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:02,494
A couple of the anthropologists
that looked at the body

660
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,330
thought that the head was decapitated.

661
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,465
Oh, my God.

662
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,738
Here's the skull that they exhumed.

663
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:16,144
Right.

664
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,812
Now, Amy, you got to understand something.

665
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:18,879
This case was never solved,

666
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,348
but according to the police reports,

667
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,683
there were a couple of suspects.

668
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,386
One of 'em was Jiggs.

669
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,921
Mike is convinced he did this.

670
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,522
Am I right?

671
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:32,495
He is a person of interest
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

672
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:35,398
Who I think it is is this guy.

673
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,967
This is Perry Deshazo.

674
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,068
Remember those two guys witnesses saw

675
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,269
following the couple?

676
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,438
I think he was one of 'em.

677
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,138
Perry's brother, Harry,
went to the ex-sheriff

678
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,942
trying to basically confess to the crime.

679
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:54,278
He admitted that they went to
go rob Mary Jane and Stanley.

680
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,378
Went bad. Stanley fought back, got shot.

681
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,781
Mary's a witness.

682
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,915
They shoot her in the back of the head,

683
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,781
and they dump both their bodies.

684
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:04,049
Now, for some reason,

685
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:06,985
the ex-sheriff they told
sat on this information.

686
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,352
These guys were never arrested.

687
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,487
And you don't think it's possible

688
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,258
that this could have
been orchestrated by him?

689
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,726
Cops know what they're doing.

690
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:17,127
I'm curious what you think.

691
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,695
I know what I think.
I'm curious what you think.

692
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:21,564
Well, I know it was definitely two men.

693
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:25,639
I know that the man

694
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,974
who hit and killed the other man

695
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,409
was definitely strong.

696
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:34,078
The thing that's bothering me, it's, like,

697
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,080
why would I hear, "She's up to no good"?

698
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,125
What else did you see on your walk?

699
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:44,761
I know we've been harping on this homicide.

700
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:48,934
There's something else going on here.

701
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:56,075
I could feel like the dead
people wanting to talk

702
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:59,182
or wanting to reach out to me,
but I couldn't.

703
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,382
- The connection could not be made.
- Mm-hmm.

704
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,682
The reason for that is,
I saw these dark things,

705
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,653
and they were blocking me.

706
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,155
I felt like these things

707
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:09,524
would definitely be occasionally seen

708
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:13,796
as far as, like,
this feeling of this oppressive darkness.

709
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:18,537
Yeah, I've seen shadows in
the hallway right out front.

710
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:21,538
The shadows appear out of
the corner of your eye,

711
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,638
and then there's nobody there.

712
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,272
Okay, that makes sense.

713
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:29,116
I felt that this could have a
very big impact on the living,

714
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:31,684
like, both physically and emotionally.

715
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:35,688
I think that people here could
lose control over themselves

716
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,556
and not really understand why.

717
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:40,387
Like, at points,
I wanted to just start screaming,

718
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,721
like, with frustration,

719
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,789
and then I wanted to start crying.

720
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:48,122
These things are also
capable of affecting memory.

721
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:50,823
Anytime I would be on to something,

722
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,192
that's when my mind would
be completely erased,

723
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,893
and I couldn't even,

724
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:57,497
like, recall what I was just thinking.

725
00:35:57,499 --> 00:35:59,199
Oh, my gosh.

726
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,599
And this is how I think

727
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,500
this thing is keeping control

728
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,634
over both the dead and the living.

729
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:06,904
It's kind of creating a trap.

730
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,408
Could this thing where you're
saying it erased the mind

731
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,576
- do that to the living here?
- Yes.

732
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:13,776
So, what I was experiencing
with the living,

733
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:15,145
interviewing them,

734
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:16,514
to tell you the truth,
I was getting pissed.

735
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:18,882
It felt like I was being lied to.

736
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:21,852
That's when my cop ears
get raised a little.

737
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:23,921
- Because you think they're lying.
- Right.

738
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:25,924
'Cause you think they're
manipulating the truth.

739
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:26,424
Yes.

740
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,660
Wouldn't a cop want to make
another cop think that,

741
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:30,793
if they were trying to
throw them off their trail?

742
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:31,652
Possibly, yeah.

743
00:36:32,864 --> 00:36:36,164
I'm looking at something
here as a possibility.

744
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:41,101
Now,
here's what I was being told could be done

745
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:43,236
that, you know, people come here,

746
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:45,670
and that entities can follow them home.

747
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:49,342
It can cause huge problems for the living.

748
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:52,773
It's likely their homes will become active.

749
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:56,112
People could become possessed,

750
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,281
and people could become physically harmed.

751
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,946
Oh, my God.

752
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:02,614
That's the reason

753
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:04,184
I asked Marge to sit
down with us at the table

754
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:07,686
because she felt something
followed her home.

755
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:10,422
About a month ago, I went home,

756
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:13,356
and I was having a dream,

757
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,262
and I was fighting something in this dream.

758
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:18,695
Well, I actually woke up,

759
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,429
it took the bottom of my bedspread,

760
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:24,633
and it went like...
and it was clawing like this.

761
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:26,834
And then it took it,
and it literally took it like this.

762
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,839
I literally jumped out
of that bed screaming.

763
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:34,109
I was hearing the word "Legion."

764
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:35,275
"We are the legion,"

765
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,610
which is demonic...

766
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:40,843
but it wasn't adding up for me.

767
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:43,045
It just wasn't adding up
for me as far as it being

768
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:45,349
a legion of demons running amuck.

769
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:48,483
Then what the hell do you think it is?

770
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,815
I really...

771
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,149
I'm leaning towards the cop.

772
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,201
I was hearing the word "Legion,"

773
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,167
but it wasn't adding up for me.

774
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,571
It just wasn't adding up
for me as far as it being

775
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:19,974
a legion of demons running amuck.

776
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:23,107
Then what the hell do you think it is?

777
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:24,476
I really...

778
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,144
I'm leaning towards the cop.

779
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,548
I was never convinced

780
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,083
that there were, you know, demons here.

781
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,317
But somehow Jiggs kind of figured out

782
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,751
- how to throw you off track.
- Yes, yes.

783
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,950
- Okay.
- Trying to set up the scene

784
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,152
to look like there's demonic [bleep]

785
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:50,959
And I'm going based on how efficiently

786
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:55,162
- he is manipulating this place...
- This place.

787
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,828
The people in it, me,

788
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,716
you know, to not get to the truth.

789
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:05,632
So, everything that's going on here...

790
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,234
people getting tugged,

791
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:10,969
the memory scrubbing, so to speak,

792
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:13,839
things tossed, followed home, the shadows,

793
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:16,406
that's all coming from Jiggs?

794
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:19,207
Yes, that's my belief, yes.

795
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,378
I believe the police chief

796
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,880
was the mastermind behind these murders,

797
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:26,350
and in death, he's trapping the victims here

798
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,350
so that the truth about his
part in organizing the crime

799
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:30,884
never gets out.

800
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:35,525
So, Mike, through all these years,

801
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,692
you thought the haunting
of your business here

802
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:39,894
had to do with the Mary
Jane Reed murder case,

803
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:41,496
and amazingly, you were right.

804
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:42,964
But the other thing is,

805
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,432
you got some pretty vicious entity here

806
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:46,898
doing some crazy stuff.

807
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,335
So, we know what it is,

808
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,071
but we don't know how to fight it.

809
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:53,471
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

810
00:39:57,142 --> 00:40:01,842
So, what I would like you to do is for you

811
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:06,180
to demand Mary Jane and this man

812
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:09,814
leave this restaurant with you.

813
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:12,550
You have to take them away from here.

814
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,721
What I want you to say

815
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:17,889
is basically that they can go,

816
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,453
that you're releasing them.

817
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:22,256
They're not gonna feel trapped anymore,

818
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:27,226
and in all likelihood, they will all go.

819
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,860
Now, let me ask you a question.

820
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:30,829
Is she aware of what Mike's gone through

821
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:35,667
- to help try to solve her...
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

822
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,401
And I think that might make it

823
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,703
a little bit even harder for her to let go.

824
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:43,006
But you're gonna be her hero.

825
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:49,949
The second step is

826
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:54,080
for a holy man to come
in to get rid of him.

827
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,507
The cop.

828
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,676
I want the holy man

829
00:40:57,678 --> 00:41:01,748
to do, like,
a blessing and a sermon ceremony...

830
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,753
because he has a root fear of religion.

831
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:11,158
His thing is about self-preservation.

832
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,826
He doesn't want to go to Hell.

833
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:17,495
I like her plan.

834
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:19,698
Are you gonna take Amy's advice on this

835
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,842
and do what she asks? Why, of course.

836
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,980
Anything for peace of mind

837
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,313
and create a safe environment.

838
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,778
And Marge, are you gonna help out with this?

839
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,679
Whatever I can do. Whatever he asks.

840
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:38,418
How are you gonna feel about
letting go of Mary Jane?

841
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,191
Anything that can bring the family closure

842
00:41:41,193 --> 00:41:44,030
and bring her unrested soul closure

843
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:47,034
is a game winner as far as I'm concerned.

844
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,208
It won't be easy removing
the layers of dead people

845
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,511
inside this location,

846
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,444
but if Mike and Marge follow my advice,

847
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:59,312
the dead will be set free,

848
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:00,747
and Mike can find peace

849
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:04,017
knowing he's put a stop
to Mary Jane's suffering.
