1
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,390
Makes people kind of **** crazy here.

2
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:10,093
Tonight on
"Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:11,728
She's so scared.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,996
a second look

5
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:15,798
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,834
Now, apparently, he went nuts.

7
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,402
New information.

8
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:23,006
When Amy said there was
a devil, I was floored.

9
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,008
Startling revelations.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,844
I was stuck in that room. I was panicking.

11
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:29,145
First...

12
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,247
It's climbing the ceilings
and climbing the walls.

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,583
we travel
back to a Michigan home...

14
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:35,351
I have nightmares.

15
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,453
Where a deadly force is unleashed.

16
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,289
I will have bruises on my thighs.

17
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,759
From the depths of hell.

18
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:44,961
You would call it the devil.

19
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:45,995
Then...

20
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,864
So he wants to kill women, really.

21
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,832
At a California hotel...

22
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,834
He definitely strangled his victim.

23
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,836
a fascination with the dead...

24
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,371
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.

25
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:56,939
threatens the living.

26
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,275
There's just some presence
here, and it's not a good thing.

27
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,244
Can this
frightened business owner...

28
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:04,414
That's why I never say I own the
place. I say the place owns me.

29
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,215
Break free of her obsession...

30
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,052
That scares me. It sounds like
you want to stay here forever.

31
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,753
before it's too late?

32
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,927
I call upon the divine energy
to enter in this sacred space.

33
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,672
Something bad's going to happen

34
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,029
My name is Amy Allan.

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,865
There's panic.

36
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,300
And it's almost like a butchering.

37
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:27,401
I see dead people.

38
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,503
They all died horribly.

39
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,188
I speak to dead people.

40
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:32,606
Get out of here.

41
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,241
And they speak to me.

42
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:36,277
Vicious.

43
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,913
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

44
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,648
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

45
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,183
I rely on my partner.

46
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:43,817
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,719
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

48
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,454
This guy's a real piece of work.

49
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,958
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

50
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,593
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

51
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,761
It's my job to reveal them.

52
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,030
This is not good.

53
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:57,731
But Steve and I never speak...

54
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,833
We never communicate
during an investigation.

55
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,569
Until the very end...

56
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,037
I want my life back.

57
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,105
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

58
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,907
Is he trying to kill her?

59
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,175
Or time to get out.

60
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:09,677
My God.

61
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,478
This is going to kill us.

62
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:27,294
I've seen and heard
a lot of strange things

63
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,129
in the years I've been working with Amy.

64
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,565
But the terror described by the
homeowners in Leslie, Michigan,

65
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,033
was right up there.

66
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,269
This poor family was being ripped apart,

67
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,354
and I wanted Amy and I
to do whatever we could

68
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,139
to keep them together.

69
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,944
We've seen apparitions.

70
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:47,114
We hear footsteps. Then
the last couple years,

71
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,817
it has become extremely physical.

72
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,788
I contacted Steve and Amy
because our daughter came to us

73
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:59,126
and showed us some severe
scratches that she had received.

74
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,762
And at that point, I knew things were,

75
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,597
you know, getting out of control.

76
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,132
If you can't see something,

77
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,601
then how do you stop it from happening?

78
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,169
Boy.

79
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,221
It did not take me long to realize

80
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,689
that the people who lived here

81
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,558
were surrounded by a
very powerful, evil force.

82
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,994
The living
people here...

83
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,164
It feels like they're,
like, weighted, weighted down

84
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:41,435
because there's too much...

85
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:44,204
death here.

86
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,773
It's not...

87
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,274
It's not good.

88
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,912
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

89
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,782
I have physically been
attacked in this room.

90
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,950
I receive scratches.

91
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,654
I actually have a picture
that I took last week.

92
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:04,925
Geez.

93
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:08,812
There's a woman.

94
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:12,066
Living. She has long hair, brown.

95
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:17,237
She's so scared.

96
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,542
She can't breathe, man.

97
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,098
Is there anything else going on?

98
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,853
I will hear footsteps
coming down the stairs,

99
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:35,172
and a shadow will appear

100
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,525
walking down the stairways
over there to our basement.

101
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,846
I would describe it like
a man, but as a black mass.

102
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:45,265
I know it's taller than I am.

103
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:52,840
There's a really big shadow person here.

104
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,342
It doesn't even have a face.

105
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,561
Really...

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,712
big.

107
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:03,951
I don't like it.

108
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,853
I- I don't think it's good.

109
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:10,624
It's, like, crawling oddly down the hall.

110
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,595
And it's climbing the ceilings
and climbing the walls...

111
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:19,733
trying to make me
follow it up the stairs.

112
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,608
Michelle's entire demeanor changed

113
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,610
the moment we stepped foot in her bedroom.

114
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,745
And when she described
what was going on in there,

115
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,113
I understood why.

116
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,866
I have repeated nightmares.

117
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:38,485
And when I wake up from these dreams,

118
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:45,058
I will have bruises on my thighs
in the shape of fingerprints.

119
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,927
I wake up scared to death.

120
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:49,313
It just reminds me of the times

121
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:54,067
when I was sexually assaulted as a child.

122
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,120
I wasn't aware of that. Okay.

123
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,305
I was chased around by a babysitter

124
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,007
who would strip naked,

125
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:04,011
and physically assault me, so...

126
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,532
I don't like it
at all, and I do want it to stop.

127
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:12,569
Okay?

128
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,392
I told myself not to cry.

129
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,294
It's not easy to talk about.

130
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,200
I felt like I could
trust Steve and open up to him.

131
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,386
And I shared some very vulnerable things

132
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,972
that I've never shared with other people,

133
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,640
but I was willing to do that

134
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:36,260
because I did want to find answers.

135
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,545
This guy ever get arrested for this?

136
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,547
No, he did not.

137
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,367
He committed suicide as a teenager.

138
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,285
Okay. All right.

139
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:47,621
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:50,157
I know. It's gonna be all right.

141
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:52,926
You'll be okay.

142
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,532
This woman again...

143
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,535
Something happened to her.

144
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,036
What?

145
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,057
I don't know. Like, she was
physically abused or something.

146
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,212
I was feeling the living
woman's fear and panic

147
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,181
throughout the house,

148
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,683
and it was very intense and uncomfortable.

149
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:19,453
There's, like, this creepy guy.

150
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,589
And this woman
in particular...

151
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:25,959
She's aware that he does bad things.

152
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,712
I think he killed himself,

153
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,799
and I think he would like to
make others kill themselves.

154
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:37,838
He's very disturbed.

155
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,641
His endgame is death.

156
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:41,842
Next...

157
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,013
a dark force descends.

158
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:48,315
Makes people kind of **** crazy here.

159
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,217
And fear closes in.

160
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,386
Get inside the living dude's head.

161
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,521
What does he tell him to do? Kill himself.

162
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,456
And in our
second investigation...

163
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,792
I never say I own the
place. The place owns me.

164
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,695
A vengeful spirit's motives are exposed.

165
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:04,765
I do believe that this
male was a serial killer.

166
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,064
What struck me about this case

167
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:21,134
was that every single family
member said they were attacked.

168
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,436
And what happened to
Michelle's husband, Daniel,

169
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:25,855
I got to admit, I didn't see coming.

170
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,825
I put my circular saw down to my right.

171
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,978
And at that point, I looked,
and the saw had levitated.

172
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:33,596
It went through my tennis shoes

173
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,682
and cut off my three middle toes.

174
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:38,050
You're joking. No, sir.

175
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,870
I mean, I've had friends that
have hurt themselves pretty bad,

176
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,422
and they never want to admit
that they made a mistake.

177
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,475
You know, I'd tell you if I made a mistake.

178
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,226
I've looked at it a million times.

179
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,695
I didn't place the saw down on my own foot.

180
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:50,780
You set it down?

181
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,432
Because I'm very cognizant of this place

182
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,368
and how people have gotten hurt here.

183
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,555
This creepy guy...

184
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,813
I just want to make them bleed.

185
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,115
This entity was very devious.

186
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,718
He wanted to toy with people
and mess with their minds.

187
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,036
He creeps.

188
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,589
He's a creeper.

189
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:21,227
I see him, like, coming
up behind a living dude,

190
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,163
and then his head is,
like, right here, you know?

191
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,550
Gets inside the living dude's head.

192
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,268
He tells him what to do.

193
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,137
What does he tell him to do?

194
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:33,322
I think kill himself, you know?

195
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,612
I could see that
this family was suffering,

196
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:41,113
and even though Michelle was convinced

197
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,082
her injuries were caused by the paranormal,

198
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,868
I still had to rule out that
they weren't self-inflicted.

199
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,228
So, I have a client.

200
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,881
She's actually waking up with
the bruising from an attack.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
What would I, as an investigator, look for

202
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:05,438
in a person to see if they're
that type of personality

203
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:06,689
to do that to themselves?

204
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:09,842
They have a hard time with their emotions.

205
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:12,895
They like a lot of attention
directed towards them.

206
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,947
Yeah, that doesn't describe this woman.

207
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,116
- She's the total opposite.
- Okay.

208
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,887
Could those dreams possibly cause bruises?

209
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:24,056
There's no clinical
evidence that I'm aware of

210
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:29,145
that bruising and scratches
just manifest themselves.

211
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:38,771
This is that weird
**** creature thing...

212
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:43,342
crawling oddly down the hall.

213
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:47,780
Like, I don't know what this
**** thing is, really.

214
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:50,283
This creature in front of me was pure evil,

215
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,486
and that's when I realized it
was manipulating the creeper guy

216
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:56,055
to do its bidding and torment the living.

217
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:59,091
- Does it interact physically?
- Yes.

218
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,394
It makes people kind of **** crazy.

219
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,463
Turns out Michelle and her family

220
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,366
weren't the only residents
in that house to suffer.

221
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:09,635
During my research, I
discovered that the property

222
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:13,005
was once owned by two brothers
who had a miserable time there.

223
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,514
Lafayette Peek and his wife, Harriet,

224
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,532
purchased the property in the 1860s.

225
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,151
And along with his brother, Theodore,

226
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:26,736
they ran an apple orchard.

227
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,138
In addition to Lafayette's
children dying, his brother,

228
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,891
Theodore, and his wife,
Sally, also had five children,

229
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,393
and they lost three of
those children, as well.

230
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,463
He definitely had a mental
breakdown of some sort.

231
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,332
He was wandering through the streets.

232
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:42,601
He was shouting and screaming
and disturbing the neighbors.

233
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,421
His daughter filed a
petition with the court,

234
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,840
asking him to be declared insane

235
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,009
and committed to the
Kalamazoo State Hospital

236
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,344
for treatment.

237
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:54,013
Well, that's kind of a
sad story for this guy.

238
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,581
Unfortunately, that's not where it ends.

239
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,717
I also located several other neighbors

240
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:59,769
who had various forms of mental illness.

241
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,487
That's odd.
So it wasn't...

242
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,706
You know mental illness
can run in families, but...

243
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:06,025
It seems to have run in this neighborhood.

244
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,431
This person feels crazy.

245
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:18,170
This house, it's caused
people to go insane.

246
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,540
Wow.

247
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:26,045
Something's wrong with
these **** people, man.

248
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,681
This place is, like, insane.

249
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,082
Coming up...

250
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,318
Just pitch-black and huge.

251
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,453
What happened after the investigation.

252
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,989
Into the black candle you shall go!

253
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,858
I clear you now from this home!

254
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,583
<i>Amy, I'd like you to
meet Dan and Michelle.</i>

255
00:12:58,702 --> 00:12:59,901
This is their home.

256
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,786
Now, things are pretty bad here

257
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:05,607
When Amy came, I knew she was going to find

258
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,609
something in my house.

259
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,346
But what it was, I did not have a clue.

260
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,781
One of the things

261
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,834
that also seemed to be a
constant throughout the walk

262
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:19,070
was the feeling of people thinking

263
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,456
that they're going crazy.

264
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:24,926
Sometimes, I felt like I was going crazy

265
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:28,029
because of the physical attacks I received.

266
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:30,465
So, during my research of
the property, it turns out

267
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:33,535
there's a long history of mental illness

268
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,353
associated with the land here.

269
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:37,739
Back in the 1860s, the original owners

270
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,475
of your property
were two brothers...

271
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,177
Lafayette and Theodore Peek.

272
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,847
Both brothers had five kids.
Both brothers lost three kids.

273
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,799
But it got a little bit worse for Theodore.

274
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,417
Apparently,
he went nuts...

275
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,986
walking up and down the
streets, talking to himself,

276
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:55,857
to the point where his daughter
tried to have him committed.

277
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,259
The thing is, there's been other cases

278
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,428
of neighbors in the area going crazy, too.

279
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,166
I saw a woman with long, brown hair,

280
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,752
and she was panicking.

281
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,287
I could feel her fear.

282
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:11,506
She felt extremely overwhelmed.

283
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,824
Somebody that's living?

284
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,610
This is a living person, yes.

285
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,746
I really knew it was
me. There was no doubt in my mind.

286
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:22,951
There had been times when things
that are happening in this home

287
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:24,886
definitely have
gotten to me...

288
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,388
because you feel like you're going crazy.

289
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:37,215
One of the other things that
I got was this female was,

290
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,586
at some point in her
life, abused by a male.

291
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,621
I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't want to

292
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,356
have to bring it up at the table.

293
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:48,459
You know, could you just share with her

294
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:51,145
what happened when you were a kid?

295
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:55,550
When I was a little girl, I
was left with a male babysitter

296
00:14:55,635 --> 00:15:00,788
who sexually abused me
on several occasions.

297
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,957
And he has since committed suicide.

298
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,766
Why'd you have that big reaction like that?

299
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:16,871
I ran into a person in the basement,

300
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,474
and I referred to him as "The Creeper."

301
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:25,029
He did not die that long ago,

302
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:28,550
and I did get that he killed himself.

303
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,201
I did do a sketch.

304
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,989
Take a look.

305
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,861
I knew immediately

306
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:43,531
that it was the babysitter
who attacked me as a child.

307
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:47,068
For her to hit on that, I
knew that Amy's for real.

308
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,371
And I've woken up with fingerprints,

309
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,557
bruises on my thighs.

310
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,043
And I get scratched.

311
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,978
My daughter, she has woken up with...

312
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:58,346
Similar bruises.

313
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,447
My goodness.

314
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,783
And they're unexplainable.

315
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:06,721
This is Michelle with
some scratches on her chest area.

316
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:10,625
The creeper guy, he
had very bad intentions.

317
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:13,261
He's trying to plant harmful thoughts,

318
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:18,266
wanting the males in the
household to commit suicide...

319
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,751
which is very concerning.

320
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:21,402
He'll never be successful.

321
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,040
But there is something else that's here.

322
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,375
The first time I saw it

323
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,595
was when I was about to go up the stairs,

324
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:34,449
and it was just pitch-black and huge.

325
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,718
Take a look.

326
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:43,858
Sorry, it's really not a good situation.

327
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,836
We see a shadow every night

328
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,705
come across the stairwell
to the basement...

329
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:02,226
and it is completely dark.

330
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,512
You cannot see through it.

331
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:07,982
This thing is extremely old...

332
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,734
never been human.

333
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,220
And it's been wreaking
havoc around this area

334
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:15,306
for quite some time.

335
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,192
It's caused people to go insane.

336
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,294
Could that explain what
happened to the Peeks

337
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,330
that lived on this property at some point?

338
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,148
Absolutely, yes.

339
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:28,753
From a Christian standpoint,
you would call it the devil.

340
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:33,124
When Amy said
there was a devil in my house,

341
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:34,759
I was floored.

342
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:38,746
It was just sickening and overwhelming.

343
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:41,916
There are many of them all over the world.

344
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:45,920
And they are much more
powerful than demons.

345
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:48,206
Whatever it is that
scares you, whatever it is

346
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:53,127
that will harm you,
it's going to provide it.

347
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,763
You have the devil.

348
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,815
You have the creeper.

349
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:01,769
You would have to hit
everything simultaneously.

350
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:08,643
So I would recommend a Wiccan
do a clearing and a banishment.

351
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:12,797
You would have the minister do a blessing.

352
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:16,100
I would also recommend therapy for you.

353
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,289
What are you gonna do?

354
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:41,025
Since Amy and
Steve came, I started therapy.

355
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,378
But the activity actually escalated.

356
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:52,253
Purify, bless, and
protect this sacred home!

357
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,957
We found a local
Wiccan to come in and help us

358
00:18:56,025 --> 00:19:00,795
and perform a banishment on
the evil entities in our home,

359
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:02,430
and to do a cleansing.

360
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,366
I remove all negative
energy, frequencies, vibrations

361
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,301
that do not serve this sacred vessel.

362
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:08,603
Into the earth you go.

363
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:12,073
He then scraped
our auras with an athame,

364
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:16,310
which peeled off the bad energy
and sent them back to the earth.

365
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:20,431
I remove all negative energy
off this sacred vessel.

366
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:24,418
I remove all negative energy
off this sacred vessel.

367
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:28,840
He also performed another
ritual that didn't involve us

368
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:32,326
that was for our home
and the land we live on.

369
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:35,530
I call upon the divine energy
to enter in this sacred space.

370
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,865
And I cast this circle big and bright.

371
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,568
I cast it now, this magical rite.

372
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,205
He started in the center of our
home and worked his way outward,

373
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,508
spreading light to surround and push out

374
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,711
around the area we live
in and to protect us.

375
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,482
With water and salt, I
consecrate this sacred space.

376
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:58,419
As I light this golden candle's flame,

377
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,889
I invoke Lord Shiva into this domain.

378
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,125
Aid us in destroying all darkness

379
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,993
and turning it to light.

380
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,462
As I light this black candle's flame,

381
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:12,033
all negative energy in
this home becomes contained.

382
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,018
Into the black candle you shall go.

383
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,170
I clear you now from this home!

384
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,477
The minister came
into our home after the Wiccan

385
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,514
to help seal and bless the home.

386
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,550
Protect this family.

387
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:33,688
Great spirit, please bring
an angel to bring happiness.

388
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:37,525
When the minister saged my husband and I,

389
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:40,261
that helped ground us, as she stated,

390
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,230
while she went through the ritual.

391
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,899
And the feeling was very positive.

392
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:49,070
She went through the
house and did her own cleansing.

393
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:53,241
And she actually posted
an angel by every window.

394
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,578
Great spirit, please send one
of your angels to protect, guide.

395
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,915
Thank you, great spirit, for
bringing this angel to help.

396
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:13,828
I feel like the energy
in the home is much better.

397
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,630
I'm definitely looking forward

398
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,734
to making new, happy
memories in our home now.

399
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:23,571
I feel like as long as we keep the attitude

400
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:28,576
that we're gonna do what we need
to do to keep our home cleansed,

401
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,445
that it will stay that way.

402
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:37,902
Demons are always
difficult to clear from a home,

403
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:40,855
and I think that Michelle and
Dan will have to stay vigilant

404
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,323
to keep it away.

405
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,041
I'm glad they're following my advice,

406
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,028
and if they stay on top of
it, I think they should be able

407
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:49,897
to life in their home
in peace and tranquility.

408
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,260
Our case in Santa Paula, California,

409
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,761
was one for the books.

410
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:03,330
Our client Rosanna was obsessed

411
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,365
with hanging on to the hotel she owned,

412
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,567
even though her family
didn't want her to be there,

413
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,102
and it was tearing them apart.

414
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,572
In the end, this investigation
felt more like an intervention.

415
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,913
10 years ago, I came here

416
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:22,482
and I saw this building that was beautiful.

417
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:25,035
But it was in such
disrepair, I told my husband,

418
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,254
let's do something about this building.

419
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,788
This building needs help."

420
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,674
So, I convinced my family.

421
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,759
It was my idea, my project.

422
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,996
And my family really resents that.

423
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:37,631
I became obsessed.

424
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:38,865
Geez.

425
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,967
When I first
walked into this place,

426
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:44,170
I sort of surrendered to the
energy that was happening,

427
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:46,656
not knowing what it entailed.

428
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:04,057
I feel really sick.

429
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,826
Like, I can't, like, breathe.

430
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:09,596
I think there's something in the air.

431
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,168
Boy.

432
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,603
There's a lot of commotion here.

433
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,039
There's a lot of commotion here.

434
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,675
From the beginning, I
noticed something strange.

435
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,810
As expected, the dead in this hotel

436
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:26,479
had extremely strong
ties to the past...

437
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,648
but also to someone in the present.

438
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,335
And those types of connections
can be very difficult to break.

439
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:35,155
This is not good.

440
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:36,790
Next...

441
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,858
There's a lot of commotion here.

442
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,894
There's a lot of commotion here.

443
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,929
horrors buried in the past...

444
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,864
Apparently, he had notches on his gun

445
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,366
for the amount of people he killed.

446
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,001
Still haunt the present.

447
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:49,302
And I thought, "My God."

448
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:02,549
What kind of experiences
are people having in here?

449
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,935
We get people that wake up
in the middle of the night

450
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,254
saying that they can't
sleep here because they feel

451
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,890
that their bodies are
being pulled to the floor.

452
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:13,477
There are people who hear
their names being whispered,

453
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,496
like, "Steve."

454
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,114
Wow.

455
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,966
Everybody's, like, ready to snap.

456
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,935
My husband does not
feel the attraction to this place

457
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:22,986
like I do.

458
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:25,172
He pretty much resents

459
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:27,374
the fact that I was so
in love with this place

460
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,744
and that I took our family
in for this experience.

461
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,981
There's something
here that I don't like.

462
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,783
It's kind of making me anxious.

463
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:41,388
Like, that kind of
rock-in-your-stomach feeling.

464
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:44,157
There was so much scattered
energy inside this hotel.

465
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,427
Like, all of the entities were
screaming at me the same time,

466
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,896
trying to be heard.

467
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:51,532
It was overwhelming and very threatening.

468
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:55,319
Like, the fear is just disgusting.

469
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:58,572
Like, I'm stressed out.
I feel very stressed out.

470
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,242
I feel like something
bad's going to happen.

471
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:05,846
It was clear Rosanna
had totally fallen in love

472
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,314
with that old hotel.

473
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:09,983
But when she told me about what
happened on the third floor,

474
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,184
it made me wonder

475
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,013
why she didn't pack up
her bags a long time ago.

476
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,746
My husband and I went on a trip.

477
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,917
And when we were on this
trip, we got the call from hell

478
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,253
saying that, "Your building is on fire

479
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:23,755
and we don't know if we're
gonna be able to save it."

480
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:28,860
Wow.

481
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,662
It was just growing all over.

482
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:33,632
It was right above this area.

483
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:34,916
Anybody get hurt?

484
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,903
Nobody got hurt, thank God.

485
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:40,605
If that isn't a sign to
cut your losses and get out,

486
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,740
I don't know what is.

487
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:43,542
But Rosanna wasn't going anywhere.

488
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,710
In fact, she used the
insurance money she got

489
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,112
to rebuild the place.

490
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,267
Someone's yelling.

491
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:58,290
People running. There's people running.

492
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:03,762
There was something like a
fire or something because,

493
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:07,883
um... they're all trying

494
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,736
to get out as quickly as possible.

495
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,579
Have you ever had an actual
paranormal experience?

496
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,115
Well, I was gonna use the restroom.

497
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:26,685
And it was in an area that was isolated.

498
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,054
And as I closed the door,

499
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,124
I noticed that the
doorknob... it moved.

500
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:38,163
Then the doorknob fell to the floor.

501
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,764
And I thought, "My God."

502
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:43,652
I started hitting the
door and yelling for help.

503
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,704
Now, how long were you
stuck? About a half an hour.

504
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,708
They found me just devastated,
just... just sobbing.

505
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,944
I was panicking because I was
in a room inside of a room,

506
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,113
and nobody knew where I was.

507
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,048
And that's why I never say I own the place.

508
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,450
I say the place owns me.

509
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,185
And you really believe that.

510
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,021
Okay.

511
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,628
I see this guy
walking down the hallway.

512
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,831
He wears all black.

513
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,199
Yeah.

514
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,767
**** me.

515
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:18,236
Yeah, he doesn't like...

516
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,672
he doesn't like women, for sure.

517
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,674
This dead man followed me

518
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,910
everywhere I went on the third floor.

519
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:29,514
It was becoming very clear
that he didn't want me there.

520
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,651
Yeah. The guy in the black is bad.

521
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,903
He's always been bad.

522
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:41,092
It seemed like nothing was
gonna get Rosanna to leave this place.

523
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,928
And when I spoke to her husband, Tom,

524
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,530
he didn't mince words
about the tension it caused.

525
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:47,465
Well, Tom, I was talking to your wife.

526
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,367
She has become obsessed with this place.

527
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:50,485
Would you agree with that?

528
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:52,420
Yeah, it's one of the
few things that she says

529
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,105
that I'll agree with completely.

530
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,907
I'm surprised she admitted that.

531
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:59,177
Her attachment to the
place is a little spooky.

532
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:02,314
I just feel like Rosanna's
becoming more and more attached

533
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,583
to this hotel. I'm not nearly as attached.

534
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:07,285
In fact, I'm a little repelled
by the environment here.

535
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:10,488
One of the doors to an
upstairs room was locked.

536
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:11,656
And this was a room

537
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,792
that was not supposed to
be occupied by any guest.

538
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,327
The door was locked from inside.

539
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,729
We're concerned. We're thinking
there's a guy in the room.

540
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,764
He's not supposed to be
there. He's a stranger.

541
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,815
What's going on there?

542
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:24,319
I remove the door.

543
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:25,537
And I look around.

544
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,472
Nobody's in the closet,
nobody's in the bathroom,

545
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:29,708
and the windows were
locked from the inside.

546
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,011
There's just some presence
here, and it's not a good thing.

547
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:36,348
And that, I find genuinely scary.

548
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,801
The guy in the
black, he's very physical.

549
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:50,462
Yeah, I think this is him
because I feel that same...

550
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:53,198
weight, that same fear.

551
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,700
The more time I spent on the third floor,

552
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,086
the more hostile this entity became.

553
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,604
It was like he was hiding something

554
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:02,974
he didn't want me to discover.

555
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,143
He doesn't like it when people are in here.

556
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,177
What does he do?

557
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,797
He makes it, like, weird...

558
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:12,767
like, loud and disturbing and shocking.

559
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,686
"Just get them out."

560
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:17,172
He's constantly touching
me, so I don't like that.

561
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,824
Next...

562
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,693
Everybody was scared to death of him.

563
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,396
Amy confronts a cold-blooded killer.

564
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:26,364
Definitely strangled his victims.

565
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,034
Occasionally, he'd have to shoot them.

566
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:43,315
The Glen Tavern Inn
was built in the early 1900s,

567
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,717
right in the heart of old town Santa Paula.

568
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,185
I found a local historian

569
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:50,272
who told me this location had
a very dark and violent past.

570
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,462
There had been a shooting,

571
00:29:57,564 --> 00:30:01,533
which had been initiated
by this outlaw Joe Dye,

572
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:06,204
who challenged a man for
having an affair with his wife.

573
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,307
The man's name was Herman Haines.

574
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:11,910
Joe Dye shot Herman Haines in 1886.

575
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,079
So, what kind of guy was Joe Dye?

576
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,447
He was a known outlaw.

577
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:18,617
He was known to be very
mean and very violent

578
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:20,919
and a high temper.

579
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:23,205
Everybody was scared to death of him.

580
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,125
He even had notches on his
gun as the number of victims.

581
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,727
He had several victims?

582
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,095
Yes.

583
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:37,336
The guy in the black is not good.

584
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:41,139
I think he's from way
back, like 18-something.

585
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,308
Traveled all the time.

586
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,011
I saw a lot of entities on this walk,

587
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:49,881
but I sensed that this one posed
the most danger to the living.

588
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,251
I think he killed prostitutes, mainly.

589
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:55,454
He definitely strangled his victims.

590
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,923
Occasionally, he'd have to shoot them.

591
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,845
As if a trigger-happy
outlaw wasn't bad enough,

592
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:06,648
I found out that one of
California's worst disasters

593
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,533
took place right in this town.

594
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:12,337
A 185-foot dam broke
open, killing hundreds.

595
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,022
I spoke to an author

596
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,775
who gave me a bird's-eye
view of what happened.

597
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,252
On the night of March 12, 1928,

598
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,304
it was just a few minutes before midnight,

599
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:31,306
the St. Francis Dam burst,

600
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:34,926
and it released 12.4
billion gallons of water.

601
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:37,796
The flood wave was 140 feet high.

602
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,967
What kind of a body count we talking about?

603
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,036
The official body count was about 500.

604
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:47,639
Where I'm investigating, Glen Tavern Inn,

605
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,141
was that affected by this?

606
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:52,878
The first floor received damage.
It was on high enough ground.

607
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:54,379
So, the Glen Tavern Inn

608
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:58,884
became a refuge for families
that lost their homes,

609
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,820
that were trying to locate
the bodies of their loved ones.

610
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,121
Okay.

611
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,612
Something about the carpet was wet.

612
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,798
And the floor was wet.

613
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,100
There's a lot of arguing over this.

614
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:17,035
What's going on here?

615
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,336
Next...

616
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,906
I do believe that this
male was a serial killer.

617
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:22,073
The shocking reveal.

618
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,942
Apparently, he had notches on his gun

619
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,727
for the amount of people he killed.

620
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:27,946
Clients face
the terrifying truth.

621
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,649
In the middle of the night,
I would just burst out crying.

622
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,651
Will their nightmare ever end?

623
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,920
You need to leave.

624
00:32:56,177 --> 00:32:58,810
Well, Amy, I'd like
you to meet Tom and Rosanna.

625
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:01,280
Rosanna's gotten obsessed with this place.

626
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:02,848
The activity's bad here,

627
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,650
and it's tearing their family apart.

628
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:08,036
So, Rosanna wants to know
if it's safe to stay here,

629
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,488
while the rest of the family

630
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,490
wants you to talk her into leaving.

631
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:15,827
I was watching Amy across the
table, and she was hard to read.

632
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,629
I found that a little mysterious,

633
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:19,398
and it made me all the more interested

634
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:21,833
in finding out what it was she had to say.

635
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:24,203
When I was on the second floor,

636
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:27,372
and I kind of felt like
a fire had taken place.

637
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,808
I was seeing all the people running,

638
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,145
but I didn't feel like anybody died.

639
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,948
We had a fire in 2005,

640
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:38,417
and it was on the second and third floor.

641
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,620
It was a serious fire,
but nobody was injured.

642
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:42,654
Okay.

643
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,855
I actually have a photo

644
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:46,425
of the actual fire when it was happening.

645
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,110
Wow!

646
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,861
The other thing that I got

647
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,930
was when I walked into the lobby.

648
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,334
I saw the carpets were
wet. There was water.

649
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:59,354
It seemed to be a pretty
stressful situation, so...

650
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,342
Back in 1928, St. Francis Dam gave way.

651
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:05,811
The Glen Tavern itself,

652
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:09,281
the only damage it received
was the first floor...

653
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,265
water damage.

654
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,400
Okay.

655
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,468
The rest of the town got hit really bad.

656
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,938
The water got as high as 140 feet,

657
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,540
actually swept its way through this town.

658
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,959
They estimate 500 died.

659
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:22,344
Now, the other thing is

660
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:24,029
everybody that survived that flood

661
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:26,231
wound up in this hotel at some point,

662
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:27,899
you know, to seek refuge.

663
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,604
I was really aghast
by seeing those pictures.

664
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,873
Just, I couldn't believe
what a tragedy that was,

665
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:37,276
and Steve brought a lot of information,

666
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:41,146
that this place had a major
role during that tragedy.

667
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,816
Rosanna, do me a
favor, just explain to Amy

668
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,185
about how obsessed you
really are with this place.

669
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,521
Well, I feel at
home. I love this place.

670
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:53,108
But my family, they don't like
the fact that I love it so much.

671
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:54,643
They're kind of jealous, I think.

672
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:58,397
That scares me. It sounds like
you want to stay here forever.

673
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:02,167
Some people, they'll just
be attracted to locations

674
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:05,604
where they were in previous lives.

675
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,907
I don't think Rosanna
was surprised to hear

676
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,209
she had past-life
connections to the hotel.

677
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,345
But I was concerned she wouldn't understand

678
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,848
just how much danger she was in.

679
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:20,819
The feelings that you've
had of anger and anxiety

680
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:24,706
are mostly caused by one entity,

681
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:27,292
and I met him on the third floor.

682
00:35:28,812 --> 00:35:32,564
He'll do whatever it
takes to keep people out.

683
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,752
What I was able to get out of him

684
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:41,039
was that he is male, was a serial killer.

685
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:44,476
There's one guy that came across
that might have fit the bill.

686
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,778
It's a guy, Joe Dye.

687
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:47,863
Not a good guy.

688
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,765
Apparently, he had notches on his gun

689
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,150
for the amount of people he killed.

690
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:55,120
I got a photo of him.

691
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,722
- He's a crazy-looking guy.
- Ew!

692
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,025
Those eyes.

693
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,193
Wow.

694
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,964
So, he wants to kill women, really.

695
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,333
I do know that there is something here,

696
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,802
but I also feel that there's
a lot of protection...

697
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:12,154
a lot of good.

698
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,172
And if there is bad entities,

699
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,324
I'm sure that the good
ones will knock them out.

700
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,843
Mnh-mnh.

701
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:22,864
You have a connection here,

702
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,585
and, unfortunately, in this situation,

703
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,254
you have deceased individuals here

704
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,556
who have a connection with you, as well.

705
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,259
And they're going to try to keep you here

706
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,828
and manipulate you and blind you

707
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:39,865
and bring that other person that they knew

708
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,701
more and more to life in the present day.

709
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:44,553
This is your life now.

710
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:47,823
And you need to move
forward, not backwards.

711
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:53,545
So, what I would like you
to do is bring in mediums.

712
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:55,380
So, there's a mental medium,

713
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:57,749
a physical medium, and a psychic medium.

714
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,734
So, they would
do two things...

715
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,721
clear the residual energy from this place

716
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:07,526
and also move on as many of
the deceased people as they can.

717
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:11,663
Following that, you should really consider

718
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:14,599
selling this place and walking away.

719
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,134
Will they let me go?

720
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,871
<i>It's about you letting them go
and letting this building go.</i>

721
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:21,873
You've done your time.

722
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:38,156
Since the investigation,
the activity increased for me.

723
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,142
In the middle of the night, like at 3:30,

724
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:43,161
my computer would just start
talking, and it was closed.

725
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,348
The doors would just open by themselves.

726
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:47,833
Couldn't believe it.

727
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,634
I would just burst out crying.

728
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:57,309
We did take Amy's advice
and bring in mediums

729
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:59,344
and assess the place

730
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,114
and possibly even get rid
of the negative energy.

731
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,419
I'd be very happy if one
of the mediums told Rosanna

732
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:10,589
that she should start detaching
herself from the hotel.

733
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,326
We need to banish the spirits,

734
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:19,064
and we need to get rid of
the energies that are there,

735
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:21,066
because this is our space.

736
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:24,236
The first medium,
she was a mentalist,

737
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,905
and she went around the place.

738
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,341
When I walk around, I use my hands,

739
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:32,777
and then I'm pulled to particular spaces

740
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,446
that I want to focus on.

741
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,885
I feel in this town,
there's so many secrets,

742
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,654
and this building is no exception.

743
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:45,357
This whole thing is about
clearing the building.

744
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:46,958
I strongly believe

745
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,128
that there's a lot of stories
here that need to be exposed,

746
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,564
and those souls don't have closure.

747
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,735
So, when I get right over here,
it gets very hard to breathe.

748
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,637
I feel like I'm being suffocated.

749
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,706
I feel there's something around my throat.

750
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:05,043
Things just feel very uncomfortable,

751
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,745
and he's a bad spirit.

752
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,481
Definitely feels very heavy over here.

753
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:14,653
It felt like I was being choked,
I was being suffocated almost,

754
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,488
and it was very bad.

755
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:19,291
And then it felt a
little bit more panicked.

756
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:22,077
You're not gonna be able
to do harm to anybody,

757
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,962
because this is our space,

758
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,165
and now we want to be
here, so you need to leave.

759
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,120
The second medium came in

760
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,307
to cleanse the place where
we had a horrible fire.

761
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,277
All I see is sort of bits and
pieces of what happened up here.

762
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,812
And there's, like, a fire.

763
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,882
I don't know if it was,
like, a structural problem.

764
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:47,085
I feel like somebody
came out of this door...

765
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,037
and was, like, screaming or something.

766
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,655
This is so much energy.

767
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:53,625
I definitely felt that there
was a pushing of the energy up.

768
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,963
I'm releasing all trapped residual energy

769
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,698
within these walls.

770
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,567
Only love, light, and peace may enter.

771
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:08,206
The third medium
that came was a writer.

772
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:12,844
I am an automatic writer,
so the information that I receive

773
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,747
comes through my hand
in the form of writing.

774
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,716
There is some dark energy here.

775
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,187
Rose... Anna
Rosanna,

776
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:27,058
she wants to...

777
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:30,045
She wants to find me.

778
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,730
So, someone's coming through.

779
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,064
It was very shocking

780
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,033
that the spirits were connecting with her.

781
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:37,769
I had a very emotional reaction to it.

782
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:42,007
Behind...
behind her...

783
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:44,142
soul, crying.

784
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:48,246
I am so much...

785
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:50,181
pain, anger.

786
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,651
She needs to leave.

787
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:00,992
I receive information that the spirit feels

788
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:03,895
is most important for them
to hear in that moment.

789
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:05,296
Okay.

790
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:09,000
It's time to resolve...

791
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:11,036
turmoil in the family.

792
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:15,974
Yes, she... she
needs to just go.

793
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,343
They want you to know...
I mean, you heard it...

794
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:21,363
that there's nothing to fear.

795
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,414
They're safe.

796
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:24,015
The spirits are saying

797
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:26,184
you don't have to take
care of them anymore,

798
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,353
and that relieves something within me.

799
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:30,422
So if this place is in the right hands,

800
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:34,125
I can see myself walking away.

801
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,416
This was an
extremely challenging case.

802
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:44,185
Past-life connections are
not only difficult to sever,

803
00:41:44,304 --> 00:41:45,804
but can also be very destructive

804
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,939
if you don't know how to handle them.

805
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,774
I hope Rosanna has seen the light

806
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,127
and will follow through
on letting go of the hotel

807
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:54,579
and re-engaging with her present life.
