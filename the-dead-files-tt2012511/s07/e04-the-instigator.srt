1
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:13,332
Something happened to these people.

2
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,646
Something quick, something fast.

3
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,107
Somebody grabbed my ankles

4
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,579
and dragged me out the bottom of the bed.

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,225
Somebody's physical here.

6
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,593
You just can't rest in this house.

7
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:28,134
Most of the problem is upstairs.

8
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,287
We're gonna try to fix this, okay?

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,476
This place is bad. Bad.

10
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:37,253
Yeah,
there's a lot of crazy [bleep] going on.

11
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,940
Something bad's going to happen.

12
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:42,463
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:43,698
There's panic.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,539
And it's almost like a butchering.

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,743
I see dead people.

16
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,885
They all died horribly.

17
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,633
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,006
Get out of here.

19
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,649
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,758
Vicious.

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,847
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,329
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

23
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,630
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,169
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,543
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,715
This guy's a real piece of work.

27
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:10,922
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:12,428
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

29
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,596
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,096
This is not good.

31
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,609
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,649
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,016
Until the very end...

34
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,822
I want my life back.

35
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:25,095
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:26,903
Is he trying to kill her?

37
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:28,176
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:29,345
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:31,249
This is going to kill us.

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,527
I'm out here in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

41
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,436
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Lisa.

42
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,041
Now, this is a hardworking,
salt-of-the-earth, sweet woman.

43
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,509
She's also scared out of her mind.

44
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,413
Told me the activity in her house

45
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,417
is so violent and out of control,

46
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,153
she's barely getting any sleep.

47
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:09,092
And now whatever's in the house
is attacking her grandchildren,

48
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,569
and that's where she draws the line.

49
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,942
She says we're her last hope and
she's praying that we can help.

50
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,990
Before Amy arrives,

51
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:22,594
I clear the house of
any leading information.

52
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:27,736
Family photos and personal items
can influence her findings,

53
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,437
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

54
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:35,080
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

55
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:51,704
There's a lot of people...
dead people...

56
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:55,940
and they're cognizant, conscious entities.

57
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:00,713
They seem agitated when
I try to talk to them.

58
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,953
This one guy wears, like, a bowler hat.

59
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,390
He kind of is a troublemaker.

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,762
He's an instigator for
the dead and the living.

61
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,771
Lisa, I'm glad to be here.

62
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,910
You sounded really upset on the phone.

63
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,445
Now that I'm here,
tell me what the hell's going on.

64
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,715
I'm being attacked,

65
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,821
my granddaughter's being attacked,

66
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,392
and my daughter is being attacked, as well.

67
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:31,294
I know something's here,

68
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,532
and we need your help,
and that's why I called.

69
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,535
What kind of things are we talking about?

70
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:38,005
We're hearing walking,

71
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:42,113
doors slamming upstairs,
opening and closing constantly,

72
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:44,048
and I'm being touched.

73
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,888
Our household is being turned upside down,

74
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,925
and, you know,
my kids don't even want to come in here.

75
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,762
When they do visit,
they don't want to stay long.

76
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,196
Okay, so, let me ask you a question.

77
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:56,830
When you moved here,
was there somebody else living here?

78
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,701
When we first moved here,
it was an empty lot,

79
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:02,006
and they just built the homes in 2006.

80
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,041
That changes my investigation a lot.

81
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,807
Who exactly is living here with you?

82
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:10,945
My daughter Tamiera and
my granddaughter Kayla

83
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:13,046
and my ex-husband.

84
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,714
- Your ex-husband?
- Yes.

85
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,150
Are you guys in the same bed?

86
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:19,984
No. He sleeps in the spare room,

87
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:23,690
and lately,
he started sleeping on the couch.

88
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:27,461
We've spoken to him about it to
ask him if he's seen anything,

89
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:31,097
and he just says, you know,
"I don't want to talk about it."

90
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,365
All we do is argue.

91
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:37,004
I truly believe it's the house
that's causing all of this.

92
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,972
Now, Lisa, a lot of couples break up.

93
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,637
What makes you think it's paranormal?

94
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,641
Well, we've been together for 36 years,

95
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,978
and his attitude that he has now,

96
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,578
since we moved in this house,
has changed dramatically.

97
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,376
What are you hoping we could do for you?

98
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,211
Help me find out what's
going on in this house

99
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,410
so we can have some peace of mind

100
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:01,344
and be able to sleep in here.

101
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:03,679
I just want my family back.

102
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:13,187
Mm. There's panic... stress, panic, panic.

103
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,588
Bad. Bad.

104
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:21,425
These people who live here are very open,

105
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:26,860
and they are being extremely
influenced by the dead,

106
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:30,131
which instigator guy loves

107
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:34,032
because he can do whatever
the [bleep] he wants.

108
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:44,342
There's, uh... a woman,
maybe more, screaming upstairs.

109
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,912
They're freaking out.

110
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:50,015
And the other person in the
house is in [bleep] denial.

111
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,553
This instigator guy

112
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,494
is very focused on this
person who is in denial.

113
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,565
He [bleep] them all the [bleep] time,

114
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,003
and the person who is in denial knows this.

115
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,438
But it's real nasty.

116
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,308
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

117
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,943
We hear the refrigerator
opening and closing constantly,

118
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,777
and no one's in here.

119
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,446
Okay, so...

120
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,981
Like that?

121
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,317
Just like that.

122
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,417
Now, I've seen a dog actually
open and close a refrigerator.

123
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,487
- You got animals?
- We don't have any animals.

124
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,922
- Okay, so, you got no animals in the house.
- None.

125
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,924
What about your ex-husband? Did he hear it?

126
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,229
Yes, he's heard it,
and I'll say, "Did you hear it?"

127
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:39,536
"Yeah. It could be the wind,
or it could be," you know...

128
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,237
Okay, so he's just being a stubborn man.

129
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,770
Yes, exactly. Yes.

130
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,338
Would he talk to me?

131
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
He says no.

132
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,342
He's adamant about that.

133
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,044
He just will refuse.

134
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:50,445
Okay.

135
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,925
There's, like,
a lot of stuff going on up here.

136
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,160
Instigator guy can do a lot.

137
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,830
He can open and close doors,

138
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:07,565
and I think living people,
if they're kind of sensitive,

139
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,398
would kind of feel this,

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,470
and they're like, "Aah! That's freaky."

141
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:16,442
He thinks it's funny.

142
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:18,912
But it's something really evil.

143
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:26,787
So, why'd you bring me into this room?

144
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,726
I've seen an old lady in the closet,

145
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,026
in my closet right there.

146
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:34,830
She looked to be in her 80s.

147
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,098
She had gray in her hair,

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,599
and her hair looked like it was curly.

149
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,068
She had almost like a witch nose.

150
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,104
- Long?
- It was long. Yeah.

151
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,672
And she kind of looked sinister.

152
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,206
How the hell do you go to sleep

153
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,312
knowing there's a head in your closet?

154
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,146
I take sleeping pills to
help me sleep at night.

155
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,213
Are you sure that the stuff you're taking

156
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,313
is not giving you...?

157
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,416
I know without a doubt it's not those.

158
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,086
I don't know how you're
even dealing with that,

159
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,387
but what else is going on in here?

160
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,153
I, um,
was on my back in the middle of the bed,

161
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:03,359
and I was being touched.

162
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,760
Um...

163
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:07,398
My breasts were being touched,

164
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,137
and I saw this shadow figure get off of me.

165
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,638
I looked to my left,

166
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,978
and I saw this gentleman
standing to the left,

167
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,147
facing the window, and he was well-dressed,

168
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,485
and he smiled at me,
and I just lost it, Steve.

169
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:26,054
I just started cursing him.

170
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,523
Then he just disappeared after that.

171
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,494
I know it's hard to talk about. It is.

172
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,864
It's really hard to sleep
in this room at night.

173
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,798
It's really hard to be in this house.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,298
- You weren't just touched.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,068
You were physically assaulted sexually.

176
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,106
Just can't rest...
We can't rest in this house.

177
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,406
You've got to be going out of your mind

178
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,573
thinking about your granddaughter

179
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,476
and your daughter being here, as well.

180
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:47,146
Yes. And that's my biggest worry.

181
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,483
Are you afraid that maybe
something's happening with them?

182
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,955
Something already has.

183
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:01,363
This person's not [bleep] sleeping.

184
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:04,468
The living person's afraid of this dead guy,

185
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,737
and the instigator,
he really comes on full force.

186
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,807
He does creepy stuff sometimes, you know.

187
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,642
Explain that more. What do you mean?

188
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:16,480
One thing I see is, like,
a shadow going up the wall,

189
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:19,651
going up the ceiling.

190
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:26,291
He's done things like go onto the bed.

191
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,024
I see grabbing.

192
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,757
Not a good area.

193
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,820
So, Tamiera, I was talking to Mom

194
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,391
about the activity in the house.

195
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:58,053
Mm-hmm.

196
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:01,121
Now, you live here with your
8- year-old daughter, Makayla.

197
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:02,455
- Makayla, yes.
- Okay.

198
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:04,555
- And she's autistic?
- She's autistic.

199
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,189
Okay.

200
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,360
Here's a picture of her.

201
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:09,495
- This is her?
- This is her.

202
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,829
- Oh, she's cute.
- Thank you.

203
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,265
She won't sleep nowhere else.

204
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,237
Okay, so, she stays in bed with you?

205
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,273
- All the time, yeah.
- What about you?

206
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,372
Any experiences that you can share with me?

207
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:23,242
Yeah. I seen an old lady.

208
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,212
Okay, your mom mentioned an old lady.

209
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,479
Which one are you seeing?

210
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:29,116
She's hunched over.
She got salt-and-pepper hair.

211
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:30,718
Okay.

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,457
She's very, like, in her 80s-looking.

213
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,891
- She got wrinkles.
- Okay.

214
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,391
So, when you see her,
does she recog... Does she see you?

215
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:39,525
Yeah. And what does she do?

216
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,061
I feel like somebody's stroking my hair.

217
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:44,262
Okay, is it, like, a gentle touch, though?

218
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,064
Yeah, like a motherly love touch.

219
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,735
But then, when I roll over
to see if it's my daughter,

220
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:54,942
she will have her back towards me,
facing this way.

221
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:57,045
- So it's not her.
- So it's not her.

222
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:04,087
There are a couple of dead people

223
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,089
that are hanging around

224
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:11,195
because these people are
so easy to be influenced.

225
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,097
I think it's a female.

226
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:18,198
The only thing I can see in her
aging is her hair turns white.

227
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,566
Kind of a witchy look,

228
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,371
like her nose and chin
kind of witchy-looking.

229
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:26,976
Do you know if the living would
have any interactions with her?

230
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,480
Yes, I do believe they would.

231
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,315
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

232
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,152
Ow!

233
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,189
Mm!

234
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,457
What happened?

235
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,058
I got pinched.

236
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,063
The older woman is being
physical to a living male here.

237
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:47,868
She won't leave him alone, really.

238
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,476
She's always, like,
pinching, prodding, poking.

239
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:57,014
She doesn't like him at all.
Like, he feels stalked.

240
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:03,688
She feels like she's
protecting a living female

241
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,490
from this living male.

242
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:09,958
I think dead lady feels like
this dude shouldn't be here

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,927
'cause he's no good for this living lady.

244
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,898
Yeah, she hates him a lot.

245
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,510
Let me ask you another question.
I was talking to Mom.

246
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,911
She's had some physical
things happen to her.

247
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,412
Yeah.

248
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,780
What about you?

249
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,949
I was in bed asleep.

250
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,118
My daughter wasn't home at the time.

251
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,289
She was with her dad, and, um...

252
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,761
I felt like somebody grabbed my ankles

253
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:39,728
and dragged me out the bottom of the bed,

254
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,396
and I hit this right here.

255
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:42,563
Okay.

256
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,798
Look.

257
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,500
You okay?

258
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,970
Oh, honey. All right.

259
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:50,904
Okay. You all right?

260
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,382
I
hate talking about that.

261
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,888
You okay?

262
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,191
I'm right here with you.

263
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,859
Nothing's gonna happen while I'm here, okay?

264
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,226
Okay.

265
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,529
My heart's beating fast.

266
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,264
I feel like... I don't know.

267
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,500
I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes

268
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,839
dealing with this, you know?

269
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,275
Like, why is it happening to me?

270
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,874
That's how you feel. Like...

271
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,208
Right.

272
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,476
How often is this physical
stuff happening to you?

273
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,517
I'm seeing another dead person,

274
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,883
and he's very distinguished-looking.

275
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:41,552
He comes in here because, um, he wants help,

276
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,921
and he wants to leave.

277
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,291
He does feel trapped here.

278
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,625
Why does he come here?

279
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,999
'Cause I think one of
the person has abilities.

280
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,870
He's inducing [bleep] panic attacks

281
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:56,838
because he's super-forceful at night

282
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,174
'cause that's when he
can get to this person.

283
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:04,912
I think that they do see him,
um, and I think they hear him,

284
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:08,715
and, you know,
I do see him getting physical.

285
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,954
And I think this person, like, sees him,

286
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:17,156
like, you know, shaking the bed.

287
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:20,630
Instigator guy wants to be friends
with this distinguished guy,

288
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,299
you know, and the other guy's like,
"Would you just leave

289
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,132
because I want to [bleep] leave," you know.

290
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:28,336
Even though, at times,
I think they've seen both,

291
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:29,705
like, at once.

292
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:34,475
So, yeah,
there's a lot of crazy [bleep] going on.

293
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,917
How are you dealing with this?

294
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,287
I'm trying to deal with it,

295
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,226
and I think the reason why
I haven't given up and left

296
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,694
is because of my mom.

297
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,562
I don't want to leave her here by herself.

298
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:49,962
Okay.

299
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:55,499
You know, and at the same time,
I'm worried about my little girl

300
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:57,567
'cause, you know, she see things, too.

301
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,768
She screams out, "Monster."

302
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:03,172
I don't know what else to do.

303
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:07,076
Like, I'm so afraid of being
in this house at nighttime

304
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,077
or even in the daytime.

305
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,612
You mean alone?

306
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:11,881
Yeah.

307
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:16,487
Like, I'll sit in the car when people leave
'cause I...

308
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,029
Aww, honey. Come here.

309
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,397
It's okay.

310
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:28,137
You know what? We're gonna try to fix this

311
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,839
so you don't have to sit
in your car no more, okay?

312
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,408
Okay.

313
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,845
It's frustrating, too,

314
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,812
because I don't want it
to mess with my daughter.

315
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,038
The second I get to a new location,

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,307
I start making a bunch of calls.

317
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,275
I reach out to cops and historians

318
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:00,777
to help me out with my case.

319
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,380
So, I just got a call
back from a genealogist

320
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:06,252
who says one of the first
owners of Lisa's property

321
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:09,115
has a story I'm definitely
gonna want to know about.

322
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,218
Elissa, you mentioned this guy Edward Cappe

323
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,320
had a tough go of things

324
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:20,952
when he lived on my client's property

325
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,552
in a house that's no longer there.

326
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:25,322
Edward was born in 1843 in Ohio

327
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:27,292
and came with his family to Pittsburgh.

328
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,895
And then he joined his father
in the printing business.

329
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:34,303
Then he met Sadie,
the love of his life, and marries her.

330
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,606
And they move on to the
property you're investigating

331
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,776
in about 1872.

332
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,912
You mentioned on the phone
there was a lot of tragedy

333
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,547
involving Edward Cappe and his family.

334
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:44,216
What did you mean?

335
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:46,816
He had lost four out of his
seven children and his wife.

336
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:53,061
His second-born daughter, Ida,
died in 1875 of scarlet fever.

337
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:56,330
This is Ida's death record.

338
00:16:56,332 --> 00:17:00,603
Then we have Harry,
who dies at age 9 months.

339
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:06,007
And he dies of summer complaint,
which is a colloquial term

340
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:09,575
for salmonella contamination
through breast milk.

341
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,109
And then, nine years later,

342
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:15,011
Dalton is born but dies at 5 weeks old.

343
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,148
And he dies of malnutrition.

344
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,519
How did Sadie take all this?

345
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,553
I don't think she took it very well.

346
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:25,022
She was only 41 when she
passed of uterine cancer.

347
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:30,227
This is Sadie's death certificate from 1893.

348
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,794
- She also died on the property?
- Yes.

349
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:35,864
So, then, his namesake, Edward Jr.,

350
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:40,569
dies in 1920 as a young man
due to a blood disorder.

351
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,203
Oh, geez.

352
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,170
So, Elissa, at this point,
this guy's been through a lot.

353
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:45,205
What happens to him?

354
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:49,110
He dies in 1922 of stomach cancer.

355
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:51,213
I found his will,

356
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:52,783
and there's something very interesting.

357
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,616
The estate owed $707,

358
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:59,689
so he dies broke, dependent on his children.

359
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:02,025
You weren't kidding about a tragedy.

360
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:06,428
I mean, he loses four of his kids,
his wife, then dies broke.

361
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:17,675
The distinguished dude...

362
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:20,146
Something with the newspapers
and stuff with him.

363
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,815
I think it was the business
he was involved with.

364
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:28,057
He was always traveling or
living in different places.

365
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,057
He would have money,
and then he wouldn't have money.

366
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,891
Like, he feels like people are after him.

367
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,824
I think he's here because he wants help.

368
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,493
So, he wants to get moved on.

369
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,830
He doesn't think he's doing anything bad.

370
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,966
So far,

371
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,434
I know one of the original
owners of my client's property

372
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:50,909
suffered one crushing
tragedy after another...

373
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,844
losing his wife, four children,
and all of his money.

374
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,914
But I need to see if there's something else.

375
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,016
Searching through old records,
I find the death

376
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:04,118
of a 14-year-old right
on my client's property.

377
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,654
I'm on my way to meet with an archivist

378
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,255
who did some digging

379
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,023
on this 14-year-old kid's
death on Lisa's property.

380
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,159
Turns out that's only half the story.

381
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,028
She says after the kid died,

382
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,130
his dad went on a downward spiral

383
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:20,767
and got hooked up with an infamous con man.

384
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,940
Well, Joseph Sulzner moved onto the property

385
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,675
with his wife, Elonora,
and their four children.

386
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:32,578
He owned a butcher shop, and then, in 1890,

387
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,547
the same year he moved onto the property,

388
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,215
he was appointed a meat inspector

389
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,549
by the U.S. government.

390
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,651
The kid... What happens to him?

391
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:42,321
Well, in 1893, his eldest son, Christian,

392
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,523
contracted typhoid fever,
and here's his death record.

393
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,622
Now, you mentioned on the phone
that after this guy's kid died

394
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,490
he got hooked up with some con man?

395
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,759
What did you mean by that?
What was going on?

396
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,228
Well, he got involved with James Larson,
a medical quack.

397
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,062
A quack? Why do you call him a quack?

398
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,563
Well, he wasn't an actual doctor.

399
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,465
Before he even met Sulzner,

400
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:08,635
he was arrested in St. Louis and fined $250

401
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,305
for practicing medicine without a license.

402
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,342
So, now,
why did Sulzner even hook up with this guy?

403
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,510
What was the story?

404
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,381
He had a fall at work and
ended up hurting himself

405
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,918
and developing rheumatism from that injury.

406
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,522
By 1919, it all catches up to him.

407
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,790
He's paralyzed and bedridden,

408
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,059
and he spends the next three
years of his life like that.

409
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,797
And in 1922, he dies of cerebral hemorrhage.

410
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,565
What about his wife?

411
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,701
Well, she ends up spending
the next six years of her life

412
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:35,768
alone,

413
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,839
and she dies in 1928 of a stroke.

414
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,941
Okay, so, if I got this right,

415
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:44,977
this poor woman loses her son, who was 14,

416
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,312
and her husband loses it

417
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,948
and winds up hanging around
with this quack doctor,

418
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,516
then she has to take care of him

419
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,350
because he's bedridden for three years.

420
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,184
He dies, and then she's alone for six

421
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,120
and then winds up dying from a stroke.

422
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,088
It sounds like she's the biggest
victim in this whole mess.

423
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,361
The old lady,
she's very upset, very angry.

424
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:08,896
I think she lost her family?

425
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:12,167
The old woman who tortures
the living man in denial

426
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,301
likes to hang out down here.

427
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,336
She's angry that I'm here,

428
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:19,242
but I'm starting to see
what she was like in life.

429
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,180
She's talking about the meat.

430
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,447
Yeah, she's showing me just how...
I guess how it was,

431
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,486
and she's showing me putting
slabs of meat down here.

432
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,119
This is weird.

433
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,298
All I know is that she literally

434
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,367
is, like, in love with this house.

435
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,970
She<i> loves</i> this house.

436
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:43,542
I think she was very lonely.

437
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:44,876
I feel bad.

438
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:47,879
I, like, see her, like,
talking to walls and stuff.

439
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:52,852
I don't know if she was
mentally ill or she went crazy.

440
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:17,659
Lisa's house sits right across
the street from train tracks.

441
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,094
Believe me, you can hear it.

442
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,195
Now, to cover all my bases,

443
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:23,564
I reached out to a train
expert to look into it for me.

444
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,200
I wasn't expecting much,

445
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:27,770
but he just called me back, and he said

446
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,973
he found three deadly
accidents on those tracks.

447
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,820
So, professor, you mentioned on the phone

448
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:41,490
that you found a lot of accidents

449
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:44,193
regarding train tracks right
across from my client's house.

450
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,730
From the opening in 1883,
there was constant death,

451
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,035
constant injuries at this place.

452
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,871
The rail roads were always
considered to be very hazardous.

453
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,708
So, what about the first one you found?

454
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,311
James Gattie, 1891.

455
00:22:57,782 --> 00:23:00,420
He's on the train tracks taking a shortcut,

456
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,855
gets off the tracks when a train's coming,

457
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:05,324
and then is surprised by another train,

458
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,859
which will take his life.

459
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:07,893
Geez.

460
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:10,095
What are the other ones you found?

461
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,468
Well, there's one in 1905,
which is a catastrophe.

462
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,636
It involves over 100 men.

463
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,505
They're waiting for the train
that usually takes them to work.

464
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:19,672
Okay.

465
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:21,573
But they're on the tracks waiting for it.

466
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:23,642
All right, so, what happened?

467
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:26,413
So, it's early in the morning, very foggy,

468
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,348
and another train is coming behind them.

469
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,917
In a matter of seconds,
they start pushing out on each other.

470
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,854
Of course,
some people don't get off the tracks.

471
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:35,923
It strikes them.

472
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,824
There is three killed and two wounded.

473
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,442
All right, so, let's go out here.

474
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:59,984
So many people are hanging
out on the [bleep] lawn.

475
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:01,987
And there's a lot.

476
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,924
Do you know who these people are?

477
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:07,326
No, I don't know yet. Um...

478
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:11,067
I would probably put them at, like, um...

479
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,607
between 1900 up to like 1920.

480
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:16,377
Okay.

481
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,481
A lot of them work together.

482
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:21,320
They know each other's families.

483
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,659
I'm trying to understand, like,

484
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,562
why are they all together, you know.

485
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,498
Usually when they're all together like that,

486
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
they all died together, but...

487
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,836
Okay, so,
that's two pretty bad accidents so far.

488
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:34,904
What else did you find?

489
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,173
It's a very sad story, very tragic story.

490
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:41,712
It's going to happen in
1913 around Christmastime.

491
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,246
There's a young couple, John and Dorothy,

492
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,581
and they're coming back from church,

493
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,185
and they decide to cut across the tracks.

494
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,586
And suddenly,

495
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:53,154
he saw the train barreling
down on him and Dorothy.

496
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:56,654
He decides to sacrifice himself.

497
00:24:56,656 --> 00:25:00,057
He pushes her out of the way,
and he's struck.

498
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,191
Ah.

499
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:04,224
His arms are broken and skull is fractured.

500
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,625
Wow.

501
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,995
So, we got five deaths and a lot of injuries

502
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:10,030
associated with my client's property

503
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:11,328
with these train tracks.

504
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,561
I mean, that's a lot.

505
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:13,629
Yes.

506
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:16,033
But that's just what's in headline news.

507
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:18,868
I could show you where
a brakeman was killed,

508
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,903
a flagman was killed.

509
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:22,874
There's plenty of deaths that go unreported.

510
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:25,543
It was pretty much a death trap.

511
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:33,551
I'm trying to figure out their deal.

512
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:36,421
Um... something about church with them.

513
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:39,191
Going to church,

514
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:41,694
but something happened to these people.

515
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:43,797
Something quick, something fast.

516
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,110
There's some kind of walkway here.

517
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:03,084
Some kind of walkway that they're following.

518
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:09,422
But I feel like everything should move back.

519
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:13,996
Like,
I feel like everybody take a step back,

520
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:16,200
and I don't know why.

521
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,044
During my walk, I saw dozens of dead people,

522
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,344
but what has me the most concerned

523
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:34,916
is the living person being
tortured in the master bedroom.

524
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:37,451
At the end of the bed is a dead guy.

525
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:41,190
He's agitated.

526
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:44,760
And then there's another
dead guy who's under the bed,

527
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:47,863
shoving his knees up into the mattress.

528
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,263
Okay.

529
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,300
Is this what you saw?

530
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,940
Yes, that's what I saw.

531
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:27,787
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

532
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:30,155
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

533
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,756
and our clients for the first time.

534
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,759
Amy, I'd like to meet you Lisa.

535
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:37,029
This is her daughter Tamiera.

536
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,266
Now, obviously, we're not in their house.

537
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:42,903
The reason for that is Lisa's ex-husband,
who lives with them,

538
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:45,871
didn't want us around all of a sudden,

539
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,772
and he's not happy about the investigation.

540
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:53,009
But these guys know they got a problem...
a serious problem.

541
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,442
The activity's bad in their house,

542
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:56,276
and it gets worse by the day.

543
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:57,744
They called us in 'cause they want to know

544
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,679
if it's gonna be safe
for them to live there.

545
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:02,881
Right now, I'm gonna have Amy tell
us a little bit about her walk

546
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,584
and see what she uncovered.

547
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,191
I went into the house.

548
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:18,367
I felt a lot of stress and panic,
a lot of anxiety.

549
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,569
I did get that there are people in the house

550
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:24,104
who are very open to the dead there.

551
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:32,375
I heard,
um... a word right after I walked in,

552
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,174
and the word was "denial."

553
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:37,544
And, um...

554
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:41,880
This is associated with a
particular person in the house.

555
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,781
They've had experiences,

556
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:46,948
but they are just, like,
completely denying it

557
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,921
to themselves and to everybody else,

558
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:53,557
and this is causing a lot
of the yelling and fighting.

559
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,461
It's obvious who she's talking about, Lisa.

560
00:28:55,463 --> 00:28:57,933
Yeah. My ex-husband.

561
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,366
Yeah, when we talk to him

562
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:03,466
about what we've experienced in the house,

563
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:10,137
he sometimes just ignore us,
and it's really gotten worse.

564
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:15,342
The arguing and the anger, that's constant.

565
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:18,312
You said people in the house are open?

566
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:21,516
Tamiera's got an 8-year-old
daughter named Makayla.

567
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:25,619
I have a picture of her.
She's a beautiful little kid.

568
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:29,121
This is Makayla. Now, Kayla's also autistic.

569
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:33,424
Would that make her more open to the dead?

570
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:39,465
She refuses to be in the house by herself,

571
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:42,102
and when we are in the room,

572
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:44,205
she will point to certain corners,
saying, "Monster."

573
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,812
It tears me up because
I don't know what to do.

574
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:58,017
Okay, baby. It's okay.

575
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,951
I don't know what to do.

576
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:04,388
She's my baby. I love her to death.

577
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,759
It's frustrating.

578
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:10,863
It really is.

579
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:22,135
There's three main conscious entities

580
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,537
that hang out in the house.

581
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,571
One of them is a female.

582
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,772
She kind of has, like,
a witchy kind of look,

583
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,539
so, like, a bigger nose and chin.

584
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,107
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yes.

585
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,410
And as soon as I hit the top of the stairs,

586
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:38,411
to the left, there's a room.

587
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:40,782
That's her ex-husband's room.
I went in there.

588
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:45,448
And she was telling me how
much she hated this male.

589
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:51,353
I think dead lady feels like
this dude shouldn't be here

590
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:54,021
'cause he's no good for this living lady.

591
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:57,324
She hates him a lot.

592
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,659
Well, obviously,
the woman she's talking about...

593
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,859
Is the old lady.

594
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,927
Is the old lady you've
seen and you have seen.

595
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,928
Yeah.

596
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,163
Describe her.

597
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:11,268
In my closet, I saw this old lady,

598
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,876
just her face, looking at me.

599
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:18,544
It was, like, smiling at me,
but it was real wide.

600
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,714
You could actually see her teeth.

601
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:24,281
Now,
who do you think this woman might've been

602
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,315
when she was alive?

603
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:30,789
She was talking about how
attached she is to the property,

604
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:34,794
and then,
when I went down into the basement,

605
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,595
she was going on and on and on

606
00:31:37,597 --> 00:31:42,568
about how she used to
store her meat down there.

607
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,935
She was indicating that
her entire family died.

608
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,840
I think she died alone.

609
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:53,610
Now, you mentioned something
in the beginning about meat

610
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,780
and how this lady was
attached to the property.

611
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:57,915
What you said kind of makes sense

612
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,616
because, in 1890,
a woman moved onto the property

613
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,649
and lived in a different house
with her husband and her son.

614
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,284
Her name was Elonora Sulzner.

615
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:06,286
Her husband, Joseph, owned a butcher shop

616
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:08,090
- right around the corner.
- Oh, okay.

617
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,958
And later on became the meat
inspector for the state.

618
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,358
Interesting.

619
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,426
Now, you mentioned she lost her family.

620
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:18,832
Now, she did lose her son at the age of 14.

621
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,333
He died from typhoid.

622
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:29,115
His name was Christian, and he died in 1893.

623
00:32:29,117 --> 00:32:31,584
Now, right after that happened, the husband,

624
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,921
he had gotten hurt in an accident at work,

625
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:35,456
and he developed rheumatism.

626
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,325
And this guy wound up being bedridden

627
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:41,230
for the last three years of his life.

628
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:45,101
Now, in 1922, he dies.
Here's his death certificate.

629
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:48,941
Now, Elonora lived alone for six years

630
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:51,178
until she finally died
from a stroke in 1928.

631
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,121
So, does that sound like
the woman you ran into?

632
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:00,824
Yeah.

633
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:09,435
So, the next person that I met was a guy

634
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:14,672
who I kind of called the
distinguished gentleman.

635
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:21,115
His whole thing is that he wants
help and he wants to leave.

636
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:26,353
You guys are so open in this house,
he's keyed in on that.

637
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:28,858
So, one of the things that I saw him doing

638
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,560
was trying to get, you know,
the living's attention.

639
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:35,799
Not only is he trying to reach you guys,

640
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,667
but other people are trying to interfere

641
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:39,568
with that... dead people...

642
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,604
and so this pisses him off even more,

643
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:43,474
and then he gets really agitated,

644
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,575
and he starts acting out a little bit,

645
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:47,844
and so what he'll do is scream and yell.

646
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:52,779
He will sometimes cause
or create panic attacks.

647
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:58,019
You had that look on your face
when she said panic attack.

648
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:00,453
Because I feel like that a lot.

649
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,057
As soon as I walk in, I'm like...

650
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,860
"Ma,
I can't feel my heart speeding up."

651
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,362
And then it kind of, like...

652
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:10,196
You know how you feel your
heart kind of skip a beat?

653
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,067
- Yeah.
- That's how it feels.

654
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:16,242
And he wants them to move him on?

655
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:20,112
Well, you know who he really
would like to have him move on

656
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:22,213
is your ex.

657
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,914
My dad?

658
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,518
Mm-hmm.

659
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,722
Wants her father to move him on?

660
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,023
Wait. Huh?

661
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,861
So now you're telling me that
he's probably got abilities.

662
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:38,464
- Oh, wow.
- I knew it.

663
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:41,969
Okay, so, now, the guy that you saw

664
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:43,270
you said was distinguished, well-mannered...

665
00:34:43,272 --> 00:34:44,371
Yes, yes.

666
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,673
Who was he in life? Any idea at all?

667
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,675
He was traveling a lot, like for work,

668
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:51,076
and then he was showing me how,
like, sometimes

669
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:54,040
he would be really wealthy and
sometimes he'd be really poor,

670
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,745
like it was always fluctuating for him.

671
00:34:56,747 --> 00:35:00,249
I think that his work was something around

672
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,585
or to do with newspapers.

673
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:04,484
You said this guy was a traveler,

674
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,653
had something to do with newspapers

675
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,689
and that, at points of his life,

676
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,326
he had money,
then didn't have money, had money.

677
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:13,725
The only guy that comes to mind
on the research on the property

678
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,194
is this guy Edward Cappe.

679
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,698
He came here from Ohio in the 1840s.

680
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,701
He wound up operating a printing press

681
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:25,306
for a local publishing company.

682
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:29,276
Now, right after he moved
onto your property in 1872,

683
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:31,912
things took a turn for him.

684
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:34,281
Everybody started dying.

685
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:38,420
I got death records here for
his wife and four kids that died

686
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:39,922
during the time he was on your property.

687
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:44,129
Now, in 1922, he died of stomach cancer.

688
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:46,599
Now, you said this guy had
money but that he lost it.

689
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:48,600
I was able to track down this guy's will.

690
00:35:48,602 --> 00:35:51,605
When you look at it,
he actually died owing $700.

691
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,673
He died broke.

692
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,740
Is it possible this could be the guy?

693
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,441
It's possible.

694
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:59,311
I mean, the newspaper thing is interesting.

695
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,617
Now, that's two people.
You said there were three.

696
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,053
So who's the third one?

697
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:06,189
Yeah, the third guy is...

698
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:08,425
I called him the instigator.

699
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,762
He does have a bowler hat on.

700
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:14,067
I saw him inside actually
messing with the living

701
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:18,970
and, like,
really just trying to start [bleep]

702
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:22,603
And his thing, too, is, like,
he really likes the drama,

703
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:25,603
so, you know, he wants to see the fighting

704
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:28,304
and the yelling and all this.

705
00:36:30,374 --> 00:36:33,979
Some of the things that the
instigator guy likes to do

706
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:37,950
is he does like to make a lot of noise.

707
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:42,824
Um, he will go under the bed and grab.

708
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,091
I can't stand him.

709
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:50,627
Now, you pretty much nailed everything

710
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:53,028
these guys are experiencing.

711
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,094
Tell her what happened.

712
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:58,932
I was sleeping,
and I had my daughter with me,

713
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,301
and I felt like somebody grabbed my ankles

714
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:06,207
and just pulled me to the
bottom of the headboard.

715
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,875
And the other thing is she was touched

716
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,744
in an inappropriate manner.

717
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:14,583
I was asleep, and I just... Something...

718
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,786
It felt like something woke me up,

719
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:21,188
and I just felt myself being touched.

720
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,254
To my right,
this dark figure got off the bed,

721
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:29,323
and then it disappeared.

722
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:32,591
Does that make sense?

723
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,091
Yeah.

724
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:38,595
So, I had a sketch done

725
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:42,562
of a scene that I witnessed in the bedroom,

726
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:47,200
and both of the dead guys were in there,

727
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:51,305
the distinguished guy and the instigator.

728
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:58,449
Oh, geez. Take a look at this.

729
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:06,388
I can't leave you.

730
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,925
This is there. I can't leave you.

731
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,431
So, I had a sketch done

732
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:28,098
of a scene that I witnessed in the bedroom,

733
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,797
and both of the dead guys were in there,

734
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:36,894
the distinguished guy and the instigator.

735
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,331
Oh, geez. Take a look at this.

736
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,297
Oh, gosh.

737
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,698
I can't leave you.

738
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,831
This is there. I can't leave you.

739
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,632
It's okay, baby.

740
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:10,639
That's why Amy and Steve
is here to help us.

741
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,280
So, Lisa, when we first met,

742
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:21,181
you said you wanted your old life back.

743
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:22,849
Yes. But now you know what took it away.

744
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:26,885
The big question here is what
can you do to fight back?

745
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,586
This way you, your daughter,
and your granddaughter

746
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:31,057
can live there safely.

747
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:33,791
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

748
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:40,600
What you're going to do is
you're going to find a medium.

749
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:44,605
The first thing that they
need to do when they come over

750
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:48,142
is move the old lady on.

751
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:50,981
The medium's objective is going to be

752
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:57,023
reuniting this woman with
her dead 14-year-old son.

753
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:58,659
So you think it's Elonora Sulzner?

754
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:00,429
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

755
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,165
Once that's done,
the medium's gonna be working

756
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:09,311
on moving the distinguished gentleman on,

757
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:11,044
and when she does that,
it'll go very quickly.

758
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:13,512
- Because he's looking to go.
- Yes.

759
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:14,747
Okay.

760
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:19,451
Then you have the instigator guy.

761
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:22,053
He's going to put up a fight,

762
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:25,124
but the medium will be able to
force him out of your house.

763
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:27,657
After everyone's been moved on,

764
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,361
I want you to take this tar-water

765
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:33,632
and put this at every entrance,
including the windows and doors.

766
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:38,138
This will keep all of the dead out forever,
okay?

767
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,341
Yes.

768
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:44,213
I got a question for you.

769
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:45,814
Your ex-husband, how's he gonna react

770
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:48,152
to you having to bring in a medium?

771
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,490
Um, I'm gonna find out.

772
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,726
He's stubborn. He's not going to do it.

773
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:55,362
Then he'll have to deal with it.

774
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,400
- Yeah.
- I'll probably move

775
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,903
because I don't want to
deal with it anymore.

776
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:02,937
So, let's say her ex-husband
stays there and they leave.

777
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:04,174
Have fun.

778
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:06,643
If he stays there,

779
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:11,546
I would not ever go to that
house and visit him, ever,

780
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,517
because you'd be walking
into a [bleep] storm.

781
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,652
Literally, all the focus

782
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:20,956
would just be completely
and utterly on him.

783
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,356
Last night, I straight-up called him...

784
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,257
I was like, "You're selfish."

785
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,993
He is selfish.

786
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:29,229
"Because, you know,
this is happening to your granddaughter

787
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:30,329
and you don't even care."

788
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:31,797
You know, Lisa, normally I would ask you

789
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,565
are you gonna take Amy's advice,

790
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:36,436
but in this particular case with you,

791
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:37,671
it's not that simple.

792
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:39,205
No.

793
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:42,041
But are you at least gonna, you know, try

794
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,475
to talk to your ex-husband about this?

795
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:46,513
Yes, definitely, I will. I will.

796
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:47,915
Are you gonna help her, Tamiera?

797
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,016
Yeah.

798
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,454
Removing the dead is extremely important

799
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:57,990
if Lisa and her family ever
want to find any peace.

800
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:00,359
I can only hope her husband realizes this

801
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:01,995
and allows a medium to come in

802
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:05,500
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing this family.
