1
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:13,833
She does not like children, whatsoever.

2
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,703
My son said he's seen the
floor covered with blood.

3
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:19,005
She gets him at night, for sure, for sure.

4
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,340
He stabs her 27 times with a screwdriver.

5
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,409
This guy really did a job on her.

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,180
She would torture the [bleep] out of them.

7
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,816
I want...
I want normalcy in our lives again.

8
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:32,118
People should not live here.

9
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:36,489
She just wants this person dead.

10
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:39,158
Something bad's going to happen.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,060
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:42,161
There's panic.

13
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:44,063
And it's almost like a butchering.

14
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:45,565
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,834
They all died horribly.

16
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,535
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:50,636
Get out of here.

18
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,105
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:53,940
Vicious.

20
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,043
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:58,845
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

22
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:00,313
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:01,581
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,117
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,685
This guy's a real piece of work.

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,955
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:10,206
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

28
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,225
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:13,760
This is not good.

30
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,495
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,630
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,599
Until the very end...

33
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,950
I want my life back.

34
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,035
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,604
Is he trying to kill her?

36
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,905
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,440
Oh, my God.

38
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:29,075
This is going to kill us.

39
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:42,872
I'm in Delmont, Pennsylvania.

40
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,341
It's about 25 miles east of Pittsburgh.

41
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,527
I got a call from a desperate mother.

42
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:49,862
She says the activity
is so bad in the house,

43
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:51,130
she spends every night

44
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,499
with her three kids
sleeping in the living room.

45
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:56,118
She thinks the activity is
destroying their childhood,

46
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:59,155
and if we can't help her out,
someone's going to get hurt.

47
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,461
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,981
I clear the area of any
leading information.

49
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,935
Family photos and personal items
can influence her findings,

50
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:15,738
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

51
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:19,308
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:30,002
Wow, boy.

53
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:33,506
There's a male, definitely.

54
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:38,044
I think he did really awful things.

55
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,630
He had a lot of issues with women,

56
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,449
like any kind of involvement with women

57
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,452
didn't really go very well.

58
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,555
And then, like, someone else is saying...

59
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:53,059
You know, like... you know,
people should not live here.

60
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:56,178
It's been bad for a very long time.

61
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,569
So, Melissa,
on the phone you sounded pretty desperate

62
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:05,705
for myself and my partner to come out here.

63
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:06,839
What's going on?

64
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,292
Since day one that we moved in here,

65
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,644
I knew we weren't alone in this house.

66
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:14,814
And it's just progressively
just gotten worse.

67
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,282
My husband sleeps upstairs.

68
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,118
My children and myself sleep in this room.

69
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,020
My kids will not sleep in their rooms.

70
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,655
Well, that can't be great for the marriage.

71
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:23,923
Yeah. I mean, I should be able to

72
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:26,025
sleep in my room with my husband,

73
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:28,628
but I'm frightened of what
it could do to my kids.

74
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,846
Who exactly lives in the house?

75
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,632
It's my husband, me.

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,901
This is my daughter, Samone. She's 9.

77
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:39,338
This is my son, Mason,
and this is our baby, Cyrus.

78
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:40,823
Let me ask you a question
about the house itself.

79
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,541
Do you know any of its history or anything?

80
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:46,195
This was my husband's grandfather's house,

81
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:47,930
so we are the third generation.

82
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,132
I actually have a picture
of it if you want to see,

83
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:53,252
from, I believe, the 1800s.

84
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,104
- Wow.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,974
Okay,
so give me a run-down of what's going on.

86
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:00,860
Noises, voices,

87
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,629
horrible nightmares, and apparitions.

88
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,031
You feel like it's something threatening?

89
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:06,532
Definitely.

90
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,619
I think there's something very nasty here.

91
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,070
How well are you dealing with this?

92
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,222
I'm exhausted and I'm drained,

93
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,608
and I've had chronic health
problems for over five years

94
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,544
which no doctor could tell
me what was wrong with me.

95
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:21,163
It feels like my body's shutting down.

96
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,481
Either we're going to go

97
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,134
or something bad's going to happen.

98
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:27,420
I know you were desperate
for Amy and I to come here.

99
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,989
What would be the best outcome for you?

100
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:36,562
I want...
I want normalcy in our lives again.

101
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,165
It's hard. Being sick is hard.

102
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,467
And I do feel like this house
has a lot to do with it.

103
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:42,885
My kids can't deal with it anymore.

104
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,837
I can't deal with it anymore.

105
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:46,339
My husband can't deal with it anymore.

106
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:49,859
It's just, like,
I'd rather just pack up and go,

107
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,028
and just to start over, you know?

108
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,213
- We're here to try to fix that.
- I know.

109
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:58,267
I was feeling so desperate and hopeless.

110
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:01,087
I mean, and I'm ready to fight it,
whatever it is.

111
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:08,461
This guy, like,
as far as his interaction with women,

112
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:12,798
is a problem here, you know?

113
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:14,900
He's a real creepy creep.

114
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,737
He's, like,
kind of on your back all the time

115
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,774
stalking, following, watching, watching.

116
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,442
Are they aware of it at all?

117
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,844
I think so.

118
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:28,180
Like, going through ladies' stuff,
underwear,

119
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:32,034
you know,
watching them get dressed or undressed.

120
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,088
It's a feeling of, like,
I'm going to the bathroom.

121
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,556
I'm being watched.

122
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:40,760
Like, skeevy, skeevy perv-o.

123
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:46,699
Why'd you bring me in this room?

124
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,968
Uh, this is the room we all sleep in.

125
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,086
It's no way for anybody to live.

126
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,488
No, not when we have a
big house with rooms.

127
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,306
So, I'm curious about yourself.

128
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,308
What experiences have you had?

129
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:57,910
When I was walking through

130
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:01,213
the second floor hallway upstairs

131
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:04,550
a very large black shadow

132
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:05,634
moved right in front of the door

133
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,303
when I was trying to cross through.

134
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:08,437
I ran out into the hallway

135
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:10,356
and there was nothing there, nobody there.

136
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:12,892
Is it possible that the shadow
did come in from outside?

137
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,026
No, 'cause it was up in that hallway,

138
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,194
there's no windows or anything.

139
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,896
- Was anybody in the house with you?
- No.

140
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,598
It scared me to death, you know? It did.

141
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:20,983
So, anything else going on?

142
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,101
My son just woke up the other day

143
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,452
and had a big bruise on his side.

144
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,653
I wake up with bruises.

145
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,839
I mean, my daughter's woken
up with scratches on her.

146
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:28,841
And that's in this so-called
safe room you're in.

147
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:30,109
Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:33,913
Could that be as a result
of tossing and turning?

149
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,749
No, I mean, everyone's on a soft,
cushy surface

150
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:38,651
and away from each other.

151
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,886
Are you afraid there's
something attacking you, guys?

152
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,688
It's crossed my mind.

153
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,956
Because if that's the case,

154
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,624
then it takes it to a whole 'nother level.

155
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:51,464
I see two women...
an older one and a younger one.

156
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:54,567
The younger one's angry with me.

157
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:55,935
Dead guy is yelling,

158
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,605
and he says she's a spiteful little [bleep]

159
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:02,908
Who doesn't know her place
and doesn't know manners,

160
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,494
and she needs to be regulated?

161
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:11,016
She does not like children whatsoever.

162
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:14,620
She doesn't look at them
like they're human.

163
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,555
And I think that's a big problem

164
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:20,042
if there's any children in this house.

165
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:24,163
She would literally torture
the [bleep] out of them.

166
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,655
So, Jimmy,
I was talking to your wife about

167
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:35,040
a lot of things that your
kids are going through.

168
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:37,059
She also told me that

169
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,028
the house has been in
your family a long time.

170
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,579
- Yeah.
- Do you know how long?

171
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,882
Since, uh, 1952, I believe.

172
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,300
Did you spend time here as a kid.

173
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,684
Yes, I spent a lot of time here.

174
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,506
Here's a picture of when
I was, I believe, 5

175
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,690
with my grandfather.

176
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,893
We were fishing down here at the creek,

177
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:56,095
and I caught a 17-inch rainbow trout.

178
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,330
- So you had good memories.
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,632
Your kids aren't having

180
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,800
the nice times that you had, though.

181
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:04,003
No, my kids are afraid to
go anywhere in the house.

182
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,272
From what they said,
I can't blame them either, you know?

183
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,273
Right.

184
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,142
You know any history about the house?

185
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,511
My grandmother died in the house.

186
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:17,216
From what I've been told,
is she had bone cancer.

187
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,119
She committed suicide.

188
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:20,819
In the house?

189
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,656
In the room next to us, and that's where...

190
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,157
Right here?

191
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:26,525
That's where Mason and Samone

192
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:28,844
both have their dreams about

193
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,480
where they swear they've
seen things in there.

194
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,865
My son, multiple times,

195
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,368
has said he's seen the
floor covered with blood.

196
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,342
It's just tough.

197
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,710
It's just things that kids shouldn't,

198
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,679
you know, even talk about.

199
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,847
And that's why I agreed to all this.

200
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,482
Have you had experiences?

201
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,919
I was sleeping and next thing you know

202
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,054
I woke up, like bouncing, you know...

203
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,722
like it felt like

204
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,924
I got picked up to the ceiling and dropped.

205
00:08:59,026 --> 00:08:59,959
I come straight out of the room.

206
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,710
My wife said I was white as a ghost.

207
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:04,730
Strangest thing I've ever had happen to me.

208
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,999
- Do you suffer from seizures?
- No.

209
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,500
- Nothing like that?
- No.

210
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:09,501
Were you drinking heavy that night

211
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,220
or anything like that?
No.

212
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,956
That's the main reason that I said

213
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,074
to contact you guys,

214
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,727
is because there's no normalcy here at all.

215
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,879
You know,
kids shouldn't have to feel this way

216
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,298
or go through this stuff.

217
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:23,415
Yeah.

218
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,384
They should be allowed to just be kids.

219
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,728
There's a lot of anger.

220
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,531
There's a person yelling and screaming.

221
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:44,703
Um, I saw the dead guy
doing stuff to a living guy.

222
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:51,610
I actually see him touching a living male.

223
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:54,463
I don't think that

224
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:58,250
the living male appreciates this.

225
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,257
So I'm seeing yelling...
yelling and screaming.

226
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:11,096
Like, "Stop! I've had it!

227
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,599
Stop! Leave me alone!

228
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:17,236
Go away! Stop!"

229
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:38,842
I was talking to Mommy earlier,

230
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,310
and she was saying that
you and your brother

231
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,812
were having a tough time.

232
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:43,447
Yeah.

233
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,382
Are you guys all sleeping
downstairs together?

234
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,650
Yeah.

235
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:48,819
Now,
can you tell me about some of the things

236
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:50,487
that are making you afraid?

237
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:58,112
Well,
I heard my door and dresser drawers slam

238
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,230
and, um, this was when I was laying down

239
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:03,350
getting ready to go to bed.

240
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,852
Okay, is that part of the reason, you know,

241
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,687
you sleep downstairs with Mom?

242
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:11,508
No. I've seen mists in corners of the room.

243
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,710
Okay, what kind of mist?

244
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:16,713
Like, blackish that you can see through.

245
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,283
Okay. Can you describe how it's shaped?

246
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,718
It's shaped, like, usually in a circle.

247
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:26,156
But sometimes it's in, like, weird shapes.

248
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:27,624
Okay.

249
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,993
Mommy mentioned something about
you guys having bad dreams.

250
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:31,829
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:34,298
What's going on with that?

252
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,335
Well, I have dreams about...

253
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:40,337
people chasing me in the house.

254
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:43,607
They're usually grown-ups.

255
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,908
Okay.

256
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,593
And it's usually a man,

257
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,846
but sometimes it's a woman.

258
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,781
Do they say anything to you, honey?

259
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,782
Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:55,035
They say "I'm going to kill you."

261
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,479
The younger lady,
she really hates kids.

262
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,397
Absolutely despises them.

263
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:12,369
Like, the energy she puts out is monstrous.

264
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,838
And these kids can feel that.

265
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,623
You know what I mean?

266
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:19,209
It's weird too, because the older lady

267
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:22,646
is really the one kind of ratting her out.

268
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:24,081
Okay.

269
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,850
I see her, like, as a darkness.

270
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,068
Um, it's like the night.

271
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:31,188
She gets them at night, for sure, for sure.

272
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,106
Um...

273
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:54,278
She's in here a lot.

274
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,481
She comes in there a lot.

275
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,450
She likes that doorway a lot.

276
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,756
I see her sleeping in the bed.

277
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,591
I think that this person,

278
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,993
they used to be cuddled or caressed

279
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,230
and then it got bad.

280
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:17,334
It got frightening,
like clutched, being clutched.

281
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,307
Cold, icy hands.

282
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,842
Really bad. Really bad.

283
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,819
So I was talking to Mommy earlier today.

284
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,754
She told me that you and your sister

285
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:38,722
are pretty scared.

286
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:39,840
Yeah.

287
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,509
There any reason why that you can tell me?

288
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,767
That's kind of scary.

289
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:55,205
Okay.
Is there anything else that scares you?

290
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:59,142
I saw, like,
a white shadow coming down the stairs.

291
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,377
Do you remember what it looked like?

292
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,980
It looked like... I don't know.

293
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:06,283
It was the shape of a... a man.

294
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,951
Okay.

295
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:09,836
So was that the only thing that scared you?

296
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,622
No.

297
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,457
I hear sounds a lot.

298
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:17,594
Like, rattling and banging.

299
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:18,762
It's coming from Mom's dressing room.

300
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:21,131
- From Mom's dressing room?
- Yeah.

301
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,366
Okay, it sounds like

302
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,700
that kind of scares you then, huh?

303
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,801
Yeah.

304
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,471
I'll only go up here, like, sometimes

305
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,389
when my mom's up here.

306
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,474
- Okay.
- If nobody's up here,

307
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,909
I won't go up here, especially at night.

308
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,028
Especially at night, okay.

309
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,414
We're gonna try and fix things,
me and my partner.

310
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:38,799
And then you can come here all by yourself

311
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,218
and just have a good time in your bedroom.

312
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:42,719
That sound like a plan?

313
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:44,538
Mm-hmm.

314
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:51,111
There's a little boy.

315
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,897
I don't know, maybe 8?

316
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,499
Okay.

317
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:57,134
And the younger woman,

318
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,935
she's like this silhouette

319
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:01,638
rushing back and forth between the rooms.

320
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,474
It's like... like there's a weird noise

321
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,312
like she's moaning or
screaming or something.

322
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,738
These kids, they're both, you know,

323
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:20,991
seeing this and hearing this.

324
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,610
But I don't feel the clutching in here,

325
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:28,732
the touching from her to this person.

326
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,436
It's more like smothering,
much smothering in here.

327
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:37,607
Much smothering.

328
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,942
There's a weird relationship

329
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:42,846
between her and that person in that room.

330
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:46,216
But, here, she just wants this person dead.

331
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,456
Jimmy doesn't know a lot about

332
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,091
his grandmother's suicide in the house,

333
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:05,727
but he said I could reach
out to some of his relatives.

334
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,745
Turns out his aunt, the victim's daughter,

335
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:10,615
was there minutes after
her mom shot herself.

336
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,142
So, Kathy,
you grew up in that house, right?

337
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,377
Yes.

338
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,646
Did you ever experience
anything in the house

339
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,648
- that you couldn't explain.
- I haven't.

340
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:28,866
- You haven't?
- No.

341
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:32,153
Okay. Now, your mom.
What kind of woman was she?

342
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,522
Um, Mom was the best.

343
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:37,525
There was never anything, in my world,

344
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,828
she did wrong, ever.

345
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,630
I have a picture of my mom.

346
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,684
This was in the mid-to-late '50s.

347
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,754
It was actually taken in
the living room there.

348
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,106
Now, I understand your mom had gotten ill,

349
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:52,807
is that correct?

350
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,143
My mother got bone cancer.

351
00:16:55,245 --> 00:17:02,183
She was diagnosed with
it about 1981 or 1982,

352
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:03,418
somewhere like that.

353
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,919
My grandmother died of bone cancer,

354
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,404
and I remember how painful that was.

355
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,656
Very terrible.

356
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:12,443
Just said, "Well, runs in the family.

357
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,695
I guess it's my turn."

358
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:18,266
And here's a picture of her
shortly before she died.

359
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,069
I know it's gonna be tough to talk about,

360
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,204
but can you take me through

361
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,206
what happened the day your mom passed?

362
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:30,678
The day mom died, um, I was working.

363
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,965
I got a phone call from my dad.

364
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,220
He says, "come quick, Mom's shot."

365
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:42,857
Got here as quick as I can,
come into the house,

366
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:47,245
and went upstairs, and
found her in her bed.

367
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:51,232
- And with a gunshot wound?
- Yes.

368
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,867
And seeing where the gunshot wound was,

369
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:55,303
it went right through the brain stem.

370
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:58,739
- She was gone.
- Okay.

371
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:00,591
Yeah. I know.

372
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:02,009
I'm sorry, honey.

373
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,149
After all these years.

374
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,350
It doesn't matter.

375
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,219
You could be 80 years old

376
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:12,720
and you'll still think about it.

377
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:14,539
Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,563
You all right?

379
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,033
It's the older woman.

380
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,103
She was sick, a lot.

381
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,009
I'm trying to figure out
what exactly she had.

382
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:39,146
She was, like,
very confused about where she was,

383
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:43,184
what was happening, what's going on.

384
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,852
Very, very dizzy.

385
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:46,888
I do think the living would feel this...

386
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,090
Passing out, fainting.

387
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,159
Somebody got it in the head.

388
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,531
Ah

389
00:18:58,768 --> 00:18:59,734
Now that I know Jimmy's grandmother

390
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,470
committed suicide in the house,

391
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:03,688
I need to see if there's anything else

392
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,706
that could help my investigation.

393
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,809
Searching through old records,
I find a strange story.

394
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:11,412
It involves a woman who lived
right by my clients' property

395
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:12,580
who got married

396
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,582
only to have her husband kill himself

397
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,217
a couple of days later.

398
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,568
I called the local historian

399
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,687
to look into this weird suicide for me.

400
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:22,373
She called me back and said
there's a lot more to this story

401
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,208
that will definitely help my case.

402
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:32,466
So, Tracy,
before we get to this weird suicide,

403
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:33,668
uh, you mentioned on the phone

404
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:36,504
there was some interesting
stuff about his widow.

405
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:37,605
What can you tell me?

406
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,106
Her name is Mattie Waugaman,

407
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,508
and she lived a few doors down

408
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,426
from the property you're investigating.

409
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:45,746
Her family had a very
successful tavern in Delmont.

410
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:46,864
So she would have been

411
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,783
a child of privilege in the area.

412
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,284
All right. Did she do anything,

413
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,786
or did she live off the parents' money?

414
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,221
She was a seamstress,
but she had bigger plans.

415
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:55,690
She wanted to make her own money

416
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,541
and not live off of her dad's money.

417
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:58,526
So she got involved in

418
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,128
the Westmoreland County home scandal.

419
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,296
What's that all about?

420
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,115
She's in these rich homes,

421
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,567
selling dresses,
making things for these ladies,

422
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:09,770
and she's seeing some
things that maybe she wants.

423
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:11,405
So probably took things here and there.

424
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,540
She ever get charged?

425
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,759
She did not, and she did
not serve any time.

426
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:17,178
Okay, so now,
I saw in the article I came across

427
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,263
- that she got married at 35.
- Mmhmm.

428
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,648
I mean, which seems kind of late

429
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,749
for that time period.

430
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,951
Well, Mattie was a rebel.

431
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:25,703
She got married late,

432
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,623
and she had a child out of wedlock in 1873,

433
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,324
and she named him Everett.

434
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,059
So I could imagine in 1873,

435
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,161
having a kid out of wedlock's
got to be a big to-do.

436
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:35,296
Oh, absolutely.

437
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,165
I mean,
even in the 1970s it was a big scandal.

438
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,367
So just imagine the shame

439
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,369
that was brought on her in that small town.

440
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:43,070
So possibly
'cause it was a scandalous thing,

441
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,572
nobody wanted to marry this girl.

442
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,974
Well, in April of 1884,

443
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,477
she goes,
and she meets this guy in Greensburg,

444
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,945
- this J.R. Taylor.
- Okay.

445
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,863
And she married him within the day,

446
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,832
shocked friends and family.

447
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:55,983
What do you... wait... wait a minute.

448
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,852
She got married the same
day she met the guy?

449
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,820
- Same day she met him.
- Wow.

450
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:01,055
What happened?

451
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,825
Just a couple days later,
he wrote four suicide notes.

452
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,127
And in those suicide notes,

453
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:09,947
he expressed how sorry he
was that he had no money

454
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,583
and he could not support his new bride.

455
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:15,136
Only possession he had of
value was a gold piece,

456
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,304
and he wrote in the suicide letter

457
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,856
to leave it to Mattie,

458
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:21,642
a woman that he only knew for a few days.

459
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:23,594
Then, after he wrote those notes,

460
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:25,913
he went and took a lethal dose of morphine

461
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,649
and was found the next morning.

462
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,584
"From the Alter to the Grave."

463
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,920
That says it all right there, huh?

464
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,756
The younger lady,

465
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,392
she was all about money,
money, money, money.

466
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:43,230
Her parents may have had some money.

467
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:45,883
Um, I'm seeing, like, gold.

468
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:49,904
I would put her not much further than 1918.

469
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:54,008
She might have had two
relationships with two men,

470
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,545
uh, that didn't end well.

471
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,347
She was, like, a control freak.

472
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,416
She was kind of demented.

473
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,508
Another thing caught my attention.

474
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,876
Back in 1970,

475
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:22,062
just down the block from
Jimmy and Melissa's house,

476
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,813
a guy broke in and murdered a woman

477
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:26,616
right in front of her 6-year-old kid.

478
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,318
I'm heading over to meet
with the county sheriff,

479
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,953
who said it was one of
the most brutal crimes

480
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:31,821
in the city's history.

481
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:38,962
So, Sheriff Held, this homicide
I asked you to look into for me,

482
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,663
it was pretty brutal.

483
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,966
Yeah, It was one of the most
notorious in Delmont's history.

484
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:43,933
So, what were you able to find out

485
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:45,535
about the victim in this case?

486
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:46,870
Her name's Harriet Thomas.

487
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:49,539
She was a 52-year-old white female.

488
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:51,608
She lived across the
street and one house over

489
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,576
from, your client's property.

490
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,445
All right, so,
what do we know about our perp in this case?

491
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,646
His name is Johnny Fostar.

492
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:58,882
He was 25 years old at
the time of the murder.

493
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,183
He lived across the street

494
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,935
but one house in the opposite direction

495
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,319
from the victim.

496
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,356
And we have a picture of him too.

497
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,691
Got into trouble at a very young age.

498
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:10,727
- First arrest was at 12.
- Okay.

499
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:13,296
And it started out just petty crimes...
you know, theft,

500
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:15,465
breaking into houses, and stealing.

501
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,734
He was once investigated for

502
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:18,785
breaking into a neighbor's home

503
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,620
and observing her while she slept

504
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,705
and actually touched her and woke her up.

505
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,023
- He's a creeper?
- Yes.

506
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:24,974
- Peeping Tom maybe.
- Right.

507
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,043
He could be referred to as.

508
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,048
The pervy guy, I
would kind of put him,

509
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,620
like, in the '70s, like
1970s or '60s maybe.

510
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,222
I'm trying to get a read on the creepy guy

511
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:41,224
who watches the living here.

512
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:43,410
He doesn't want me to see anything,

513
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:46,629
but I'm getting quick glimpses
of what he was like in life.

514
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,565
He's weird.

515
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,600
Like, stalker.

516
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:58,108
He was some kind of sexual offender.

517
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,126
All right, so how's this homicide go down?

518
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,045
On February 28th, 1970,

519
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,264
he broke into Harriet Thomas' house.

520
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:05,498
Apparently, he was mixing alcohol

521
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:07,684
with 15 Benzodiazepine pills.

522
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,702
- Very strong narcotics.
- Yes.

523
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:11,788
There's a struggle with her,

524
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:13,723
and he stabs her 27 times
with a screwdriver

525
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,308
in front of her 6-year-old son.

526
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:17,827
And I have the coroner's report here.

527
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:20,730
Okay.

528
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:23,399
So she's stabbed in the
chest with a screwdriver.

529
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,568
This guy really did a job on her.

530
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:27,103
He was actually convicted in this courtroom

531
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,205
right here on December 7th, 1970.

532
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,691
So now, what did he get convicted of?

533
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,009
He got convicted of murder

534
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:34,844
and got sentenced to life
in prison without parole.

535
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,747
And we have a, uh... we have a photo here

536
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,682
that is a Department of Corrections photo.

537
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:40,884
Okay, so now, this guy's 25

538
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,502
at the time of the homicide in '70.

539
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,387
Plausibly,
he could still be alive in jail, right?

540
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,322
Oh, no. He died in 2003 of lung cancer

541
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,574
at the age of 57.

542
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,809
Good. He deserved it.

543
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:54,397
Something about fif... The number 15

544
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,666
has something to do with this male.

545
00:24:56,751 --> 00:25:00,904
I do see blood on his hands
when he's talking about this.

546
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:06,409
He's older. He's probably in his 50s.

547
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:09,062
He's got, like, that kind of hairstyle.

548
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,781
It's longer, you know, swept over.

549
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:14,651
He occasionally has a mustache.

550
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,920
You would never think he was a weirdo.

551
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:21,658
Like, he looks like a nice,
little middle-aged,

552
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,127
you know, family man or something.

553
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:32,202
I saw several dead people during my walk.

554
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,737
But the angry woman
tormenting a living child

555
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,506
had me the most concerned.

556
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,041
She's young.

557
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,275
Pretty thin.

558
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:42,145
She had dark hair.

559
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:48,218
There was a kid in the bed.

560
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,790
And this lady,
she was smothering this child.

561
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:59,646
Is this what you saw?

562
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,614
Yes. That's what I saw.

563
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,196
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

564
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,481
we're ready to reveal our findings

565
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,568
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

566
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,738
Now, Amy, when you talked to
Jimmy and Melissa here, um,

567
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,373
it doesn't take but a couple of seconds

568
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:37,109
to realize how much they love their kids.

569
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:39,311
I have a photo here of the family.

570
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,513
This is their oldest daughter,
Samone, who's 9.

571
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,449
This is Mason, who's 7.

572
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,918
And this is Cyrus, who is now what, 20...

573
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,253
- 22 months.
- 22 months.

574
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,238
Now, they're the reason we're here.

575
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:51,941
Melissa thinks they're in danger.

576
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,260
Even though that house
has been in Jimmy's family

577
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:56,895
for three generations,
if we can't help them,

578
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,998
he's ready to pack up and leave.

579
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,866
So now that Amy knows a
little bit about your family

580
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,917
and what's going on here,

581
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:06,071
I'm gonna ask her to describe her walk.

582
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,240
When I got here,

583
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:12,745
there were several dead
people roaming about.

584
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,648
But first I want to discuss

585
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,017
the male that's in the living room area.

586
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,168
Okay.

587
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:24,256
And, um,
he seemed to be kind of a sexual deviant.

588
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:27,443
I actually saw him going through ladies'
underwear.

589
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:30,763
He likes to watch people get undressed.

590
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:34,066
He also likes to caress or touch people.

591
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,284
That doesn't surprise me,

592
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,902
'cause I always feel
like I'm being watched,

593
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,021
and it's weird because when I'm
getting a shower or anything,

594
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:40,105
it's like I shut the door,
and then I still feel like

595
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,440
there's a camera or something on me.

596
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,877
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm not alone in there.

597
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:48,130
I did actually see him in
the upstairs master bedroom,

598
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:50,683
and he was touching a male.

599
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,117
What I saw was

600
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:55,421
this male feeling something
strange happening,

601
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,356
and kind of being like,

602
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,141
you know, "I'm sick and tired of this.

603
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:00,893
It's got to stop."

604
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,928
It's funny you mentioned upstairs because,
I mean,

605
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,431
things are so bad in the house
that Melissa and the kids

606
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,099
sleep down here in the living room.

607
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:07,866
Okay.

608
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,018
Do me a favor.

609
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,603
Tell Amy about the incident with the bed.

610
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,489
Yeah.

611
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:16,375
I felt like I was picked up,

612
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,711
picked up to the ceiling and dropped.

613
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:20,012
And he's not someone who scares easily.

614
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:21,930
When he came out, he was white as a ghost,

615
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,432
and I knew something was wrong.

616
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,485
I had no clue.

617
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,887
Now,
I did come across a perv in my research,

618
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:30,556
but I need to know a little
bit more about this guy

619
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,224
if you've got anything.

620
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:36,061
I got that he was from the '60s or '70s.

621
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,715
The number 15 was important.

622
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,234
He was talking about women in his life

623
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,887
and how that never went well.

624
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,673
Obviously, he had sexual problems.

625
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:50,242
So then I saw him looking
in a mirror in a bathroom,

626
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,860
and he had his hands up,

627
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:54,930
and there was blood all over his hands.

628
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,349
Well, a lot of things you're saying

629
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:00,152
reminds me of a guy named Johnny Fostar.

630
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:02,287
He grew up a couple doors down from here.

631
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,456
I got a photo of him here.

632
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,041
Now, this guy was a neighborhood criminal.

633
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,309
- Oh.
- He stole a lot from everybody.

634
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:08,627
He was a thief.

635
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:11,647
Now, most of these crimes
took place during the '60s.

636
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:15,434
Now, in 1968,
he got caught breaking into a woman's house

637
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,919
and watching her sleep,

638
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:18,937
and she woke up when he touched her.

639
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,605
Oh, my goodness.

640
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:20,973
Oh, Lord.

641
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,841
- You mentioned about blood on his hands...
- Uh-huh.

642
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,893
- ...and the number 15.
- Uh-huh.

643
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:28,147
On the night of February 28th, 1970,

644
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:30,482
uh, Johnny here wound up taking 15 pills,

645
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,434
- very strong narcotics...
- Oh.

646
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,685
Mixed with booze,

647
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:35,521
and he breaks into a woman's house

648
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,789
right across the street from you

649
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:37,956
by the name of Harriet Thomas.

650
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:41,326
She was a 52-year-old female.

651
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,431
Harriet gets attacked by Johnny.

652
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,849
He stabs her 27 times in the chest

653
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,267
- with a screwdriver...
- Oh, my God.

654
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,487
- Oh, my God.
- ...In front of her 6-year-old kid.

655
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:53,806
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

656
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:56,175
I actually got the coroner's report.

657
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,110
Stab wound of chest with a screwdriver.

658
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,412
Oh, my goodness.

659
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,748
My God.

660
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,651
He was convicted and
sentenced to life in prison.

661
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:08,270
He wound up dying in
prison at the age of 57.

662
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,925
- I got a photo of him just before he died.
- Oh, hmm.

663
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:14,910
Now, is it possible this
could be the guy you saw?

664
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,212
Yeah. I think that's the guy.

665
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:22,634
I wish I could just meet him,

666
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:25,737
and I wish I could just
do something [bleep]

667
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,575
Could this be who lifted Jimmy?

668
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:32,411
Oh, I don't think so.

669
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:34,346
There's someone worse.

670
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,936
I met two women in here.

671
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,522
Um, but the first one I'm going to discuss

672
00:30:43,657 --> 00:30:45,691
is the older woman.

673
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:50,195
She doesn't really interact
with living people.

674
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:52,965
Um, I know that she got sick here.

675
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,867
She felt ill here.

676
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:58,170
I got her sickness a lot upstairs...

677
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,372
Dizziness, pain.

678
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:03,659
I got that there was some mental confusion

679
00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:06,512
with her, uh, death,

680
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,146
and then the worst part,

681
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:10,182
there was an impact to her head.

682
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:16,705
You okay, Jimmy?

683
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,240
What?

684
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,760
This is a little bit of
a delicate situation.

685
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,597
Um,
you mentioned the woman you saw was sick.

686
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,032
Back in the 1980s, Jimmy's
grandmother Helen

687
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,668
was diagnosed with bone cancer.

688
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:30,953
Oh.

689
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:32,905
Um, she suffered a great deal.

690
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,939
It might've been a problem
with the medication.

691
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,608
- She was disoriented.
- Yes. Okay.

692
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,826
So, um...

693
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,613
back in 1989,

694
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,232
Jimmy's grandmother wound
up committing suicide

695
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,350
by shooting herself in the head upstairs.

696
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:55,360
She was just a good woman, you know?

697
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,731
She was, like, a... like,
a saint, you know?

698
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,986
I actually have a picture
of your grandmother.

699
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:07,306
This is not too long before she passed.

700
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,374
They didn't tell me she was sick.

701
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,759
Wow.

702
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:14,446
The important thing is for Jimmy to know,

703
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,614
is his grandmother here?

704
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,165
I...Yeah.

705
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:20,335
The good news is

706
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,821
I think she's here watching over you guys.

707
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,057
She was really helpful as far as...

708
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:25,958
Oh, okay.

709
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:27,943
You know, telling me bad things

710
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,628
that other dead people
were doing, you know?

711
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:30,996
Okay.

712
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,032
I mean, I was hoping this wasn't the case,

713
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:35,667
that your grandmother wasn't here,

714
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,304
but it sounds like at
least she's trying to help.

715
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,806
She's protecting.

716
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,541
Yeah.

717
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:45,928
There's one other thing I want to bring up,

718
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,479
and this involves one of the kids.

719
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:48,780
It's Mason, who's 7, right?

720
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,315
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

721
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,566
You know what, Jimmy?
You explain it to her better.

722
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:53,885
It's your son, about what he sees in...

723
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,521
He says he sees blood on the floor

724
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,324
in the same room that my grandmother died.

725
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,325
Okay.

726
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,895
And he's pretty dead set on it.

727
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,432
Well, you do have a dead person here

728
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:13,188
who would prefer the children
have negative experiences.

729
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,773
That's what I thought.

730
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:24,049
So the person that I think
is the biggest threat here

731
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:27,686
is this younger dead woman.

732
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:32,124
She seems to be from a very long time ago.

733
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:35,360
I put her at about 25 years of age.

734
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:37,629
I think her parents had some money

735
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,432
because her fixation in life

736
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:44,269
was very much focused on money and image.

737
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,573
And she had two relationships
with two different men

738
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,993
that did not end well.

739
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,912
I got one woman in the
research that came up

740
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:56,281
that actually only lived a
couple doors down from here.

741
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,183
This woman named Mattie Waugaman

742
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,018
lived down here in the late 1800s.

743
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,253
Her parents owned a tavern in town

744
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,789
and were part of Delmont's high society.

745
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,074
Now, you mentioned the woman
you saw is obsessed with money.

746
00:34:06,193 --> 00:34:07,109
Uh, this woman, Mattie,

747
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:10,495
was caught up in a pretty big scandal.

748
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,130
She was accused of stealing things

749
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,331
from wealthy people's homes,

750
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,417
but she was never charged.

751
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,535
Interesting.

752
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,936
But what really got my attention

753
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,772
was what you said about the
bad relationships with men.

754
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:22,057
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:26,078
This woman had disastrous
relationships with two men.

756
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,779
- Hmm.
- 1873, she had a kid out of wedlock,

757
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:31,583
- which is pretty unheard of back then.
- Back then, yeah, of course.

758
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,819
So when she had the baby,
it was a huge scandal.

759
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,070
About 11 years later,

760
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:37,456
she wound up having a second
disastrous relationship

761
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,175
with a man, a guy named J.R. Taylor.

762
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:42,227
She met him and married him the same day.

763
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:43,695
- Oh.
- Oh, nice.

764
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,865
Three days later,
this guy J.R. Taylor committed suicide

765
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,168
with an overdose of morphine.

766
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,437
- Wow.
- I actually have an article here from it.

767
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,341
Now, in the suicide letter,

768
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,076
he basically said that he
didn't have enough money

769
00:34:58,178 --> 00:34:59,277
to support his new wife,

770
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:01,730
and he left her the only
thing he had of value,

771
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,048
the gold piece.

772
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,966
So you got to wonder what
kind of a woman that was

773
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,119
that had this guy so wrapped up in one day.

774
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,253
Mm.

775
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,455
Now, when Mattie died in 1905,

776
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:12,724
she was buried in the
cemetery right up the street.

777
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,493
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

778
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:18,080
Now, does this sound like
possibly who you ran into?

779
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,865
Sounds about right.

780
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:27,506
I feel, obviously,
that she has some mental issues.

781
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:33,678
The biggest problem was that
she really despises children.

782
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,651
She doesn't even see them as human.

783
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,321
When I saw her upstairs,

784
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:46,892
she's like this monstrous,
like, being up there.

785
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:50,695
And there's this energy
that's just horrendous.

786
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:56,401
She knows exactly what
to do to torture someone.

787
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,236
I see her sleeping in the bed,

788
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:01,540
like, clutched, being clutched.

789
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:07,078
Cold, icy hands.

790
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,247
Really bad.

791
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:12,350
I saw her racing back and
forth through that door

792
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,352
as, like, a silhouetted figure

793
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,888
between the two children's bedrooms.

794
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:21,193
Now you know why the kids sleep downstairs.

795
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:23,879
My daughter woke up screaming

796
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:25,230
that somebody was in her room

797
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,665
opening and slamming her drawers.

798
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,633
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, she was terrified.

799
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:31,970
Mason had an incident where he saw
white mist coming up the stairs.

800
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:34,789
Yeah. He said it was a white mist.

801
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,374
It looked like a human shape.

802
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,826
Okay.

803
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,828
And they wake up with bruises.

804
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,079
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

805
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,480
- And scratches.
- Yeah.

806
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,082
Wow.

807
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:46,735
Now, could this be this...

808
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,704
- this woman?
- Yeah. Yeah.

809
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,029
To think that something is...
is attacking my kids,

810
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,715
that's enraging.

811
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:06,071
Yeah, kids can't grow up like this.

812
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,139
So I had a sketch done of something

813
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,410
that she would like to do, um, to your son.

814
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:22,754
As a parent, I don't even want to

815
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,322
put this down in front of you,

816
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,824
but, you know...

817
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,110
Oh, my God.

818
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,431
She's lucky I can't see her.

819
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:36,568
I carry a gun on me.

820
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,106
She's lucky she's not living.

821
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,348
I had a sketch done of something

822
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,785
that she would like to do, um, to your son.

823
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:12,996
As a parent, I don't even want to

824
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,497
put this down in front of you,

825
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,382
but, you know...

826
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:19,786
Oh, my God.

827
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:25,675
She's lucky I can't see her.

828
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:28,678
I carry a gun on me.

829
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,216
She's lucky she's not living.

830
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,319
So she's trying to smother him?

831
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:37,854
Mm-hmm.

832
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:40,723
Mason breathes real heavy.

833
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:43,660
You can hear him...

834
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,795
It sounds like he's
having problems breathing.

835
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:47,981
Okay.

836
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,701
She does a weird thing
with her hands and fingers

837
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,105
over his mouth, so that does worry me.

838
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:58,308
This wicked, little [bleep] needs to go.

839
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:00,843
What's her endgame?

840
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:04,747
As far as your son is concerned,

841
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,383
like, she would like to kill him.

842
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:12,889
I mean, that's her... her goal.

843
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:16,075
Is she even capable of doing
that to this kid, God forbid?

844
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,127
I think it's a possibility.

845
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,980
So... so that does worry me.

846
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,165
I'd burn it to the ground

847
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,834
if it meant for my family to be happy.

848
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,337
It's just... I mean,
the house does mean a lot to me,

849
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,255
but it doesn't mean nowhere even close

850
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:31,391
to what my children and my wife mean to me.

851
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:32,425
Right.

852
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:36,980
So guys, it's been a rough night,

853
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:42,285
and I'm really sorry about that,
especially about your grandma.

854
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,187
Um, but you two are fighters,

855
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:46,773
and now you know what's
going after your kids.

856
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,926
Now the thing is, how do we get
rid of the bad dead in the house

857
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,394
so you guys can live a normal life

858
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:54,547
and raise your kids here
in a comfortable manner?

859
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:56,466
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

860
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,606
Uh,
the first thing is to find a male medium.

861
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:09,145
And this person,
on the first day they're here,

862
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:12,548
is to deal with the male that's here.

863
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:16,052
So the medium's job here is
to get him out of your house

864
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:18,121
and to banish him from the house.

865
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,840
And then the second day, actually,

866
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,959
I would like for him, the male medium,

867
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:24,927
to give you a reading

868
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,263
because there are things

869
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:31,284
that your grandmother needs to talk about.

870
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:34,587
Once the reading is finished,
she'll be ready to move on.

871
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:39,409
Okay. Now, what about the lunatic woman?

872
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:42,445
Uh, the last thing that you guys do

873
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,881
is to have a Voodoo priestess come.

874
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:48,968
This is something that terrifies her.

875
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:51,287
So I think that she feels like

876
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:54,290
that's going to put her in a place

877
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:58,027
where she kind of knows she belongs.

878
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:00,296
She's pretty terrified.

879
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,030
Good.

880
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,648
This little [bleep]...

881
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:05,168
she could get hit by a bus tomorrow

882
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:08,071
and I wouldn't care, you know what I mean?

883
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:09,439
So, Jimmy, it's got to make you feel good

884
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,307
that you can keep the house
that's been in your family

885
00:41:11,393 --> 00:41:12,475
for three generations.

886
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:15,428
Of course. Yes.

887
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:17,180
You gonna take Amy's advice?

888
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:20,483
Absolutely. Absolutely.

889
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:21,350
She's gone.

890
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:26,122
I'm really concerned for Melissa and Jimmy,

891
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:27,857
as the dead terrorizing their family

892
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,992
present a serious danger.

893
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:32,695
But with the help of a medium
and a Voodoo priestess,

894
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:33,996
they'll be able to rid their home

895
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:36,032
of the evil surrounding it
and live a peaceful life.
