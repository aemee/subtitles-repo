1
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,533
I wouldn't want to mess with this woman.

2
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,241
She's very powerful.

3
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,090
The last owner killed all
three of her husbands.

4
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:19,263
It hurts so much.

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:21,402
I thought I was going to die.

6
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,944
It absolutely terrified me.

7
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:25,412
And it's almost like a butchering.

8
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:27,120
In the name of Jesus, you go.

9
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:29,127
Vicious.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,329
They're burning them alive.

11
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,007
Something bad's going to happen.

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,916
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:39,283
There's panic.

14
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,720
And it's almost like a butchering.

15
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:41,790
I see dead people.

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,928
They all died horribly.

17
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,634
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:47,040
Get out of here.

19
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,674
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,713
Vicious.

21
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,863
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:55,569
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

23
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,146
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,782
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,685
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,389
This guy's a real piece of work.

27
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,061
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:07,563
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

29
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:08,733
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,005
This is not good.

31
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,744
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,780
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,549
Until the very end.

34
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:18,022
I want my life back.

35
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,427
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,031
Is he trying to kill her?

37
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,301
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:24,974
Oh, my god.

39
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:26,378
This is going to kill us.

40
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,097
This is the first time

41
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:48,633
Amy and I are doing an
investigation overseas together.

42
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:52,341
We're in Jamaica,
a Caribbean Island just south of Cuba.

43
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:56,316
Now, the reason we're here is
I got a call from a young expat

44
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,754
who took over the family business.

45
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:02,294
It's a historic plantation
house in Montego Bay.

46
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:04,280
He says the activity is out of control.

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,785
His employees are scared,

48
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,619
guests are running out
of the place screaming,

49
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,992
and now even his kids are affected.

50
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:12,128
He says if we can't help him,

51
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,663
he's gonna pack his things and leave.

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,310
Before Amy arrives,

53
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,313
I clear the area of any leading information.

54
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:30,420
Photographs and artwork
can influence her findings,

55
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,620
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

56
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:34,854
When I'm finished,

57
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:40,327
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

58
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,511
There's this man.

59
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:57,849
He was treated like a dog. He had a chain.

60
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:01,018
Lots of, uh, blood.

61
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:05,159
They were setting people on fire.

62
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:06,794
They're burning them alive.

63
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:10,199
You know, pretty [Bleep] brutal [Bleep]

64
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,192
Well, Michael,
this is an incredible building

65
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:28,244
with spectacular views.

66
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,144
But I assume you guys don't live here

67
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,111
because it looks like it's set up as,
like a museum.

68
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,614
You're exactly right. It's a museum.

69
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:37,659
But it, first,
it was a sugarcane plantation.

70
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,070
Okay.

71
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,899
And eventually,
my father bought this place in the mid-'60s

72
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,064
and then started restoring
this Rose Hall Great House.

73
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,667
What kind of shape was the place
in when your father took over?

74
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,102
Well, when my father took over,

75
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,700
nobody had lived here for,
I believe, over 60 years.

76
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,705
You'd never know it was the same building.

77
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,106
How long have you been running this place?

78
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:58,708
For close to three years now.

79
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,409
Before that, I was in banking.

80
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:03,111
And I worked in finance,
actually, in New York City.

81
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:07,715
It had been a 50-year, you know,
passion project for my father.

82
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,486
And it was very important
for me to uphold that legacy.

83
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,055
Now, Michael, what kind of things

84
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,256
are we talking about that
people are experiencing?

85
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,959
It really runs the gamut from seeing things

86
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:20,294
to hearing things

87
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,697
to actually feeling as
if they've been touched

88
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,600
to, in the worst case,
feeling as if they've been pushed.

89
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:28,268
But for me, you know, the final straw

90
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,739
was my daughter had had an experience.

91
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,141
She was very scared

92
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:34,476
and had a hard time being
around here after that.

93
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,743
What about yourself, any experiences?

94
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:36,744
Yes.

95
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,279
When I would go up the staircase

96
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,247
and start going the rounds to the bedrooms,

97
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,116
I felt as if there was a presence there,

98
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,183
that somebody was on my back.

99
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,350
But really, the reason why I called you

100
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,652
was I was really worried about the guests,

101
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:51,053
the employees who are
here on a regular basis,

102
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,519
and I'm worried about my kids.

103
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:55,318
Now, has the activity always been bad?

104
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,851
Activity didn't pick up till we
started doing the night tour.

105
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,519
When did the night tour start?

106
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,755
The night tour started about two years ago.

107
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,257
Okay, so, now,
what kind of tours are we talking about?

108
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,625
It's for the most part historical.

109
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:05,826
Okay, so these people

110
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,726
- aren't coming in here ghost hunting?
- No.

111
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,328
Okay, so, what kind of history
are you covering on this tour?

112
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,330
The last mistress of the
house was Annie Palmer,

113
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,999
who supposedly had, within 12 years,

114
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,035
killed three husbands and countless slaves

115
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:20,371
and was finally murdered at the house.

116
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:23,236
And she's actually buried
over on the property,

117
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,336
right over there.

118
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,742
There's this woman.

119
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:36,945
And she's very well-groomed.

120
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:41,651
She's so, like, an authority,
like a powerful person.

121
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:44,019
She's very in control.

122
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,889
I would want to mess with this woman.

123
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,393
Something is going on

124
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:55,031
that is making her very
stressed out and angry.

125
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:03,738
She definitely is present here.

126
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,708
So, Mrs. Rollins,
it's good to meet with you.

127
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,877
Likewise.

128
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,413
So, I was talking to your son.

129
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,047
And it sounds like you
got some problems here.

130
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,281
Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:19,449
Okay, so, I'm curious.

132
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,983
What actually drew you guys to this place?

133
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,886
Well, my husband came for a vacation,

134
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,856
and what really impressed
him the most were the people.

135
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:30,162
There's just a<i> joie de vivre,
</i> a laughter, a joy about them.

136
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,566
But when Michael came
and brought his family,

137
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,169
I began to think, you know,

138
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,036
"Maybe we should relook at this."

139
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,373
Well, your 8-year-old granddaughter

140
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,278
seems to have had an experience.

141
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,445
Yes. I was shocked.

142
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:42,845
Now, what about yourself?

143
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,279
Well, you can be here at night

144
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,484
and have the hackles raise
on the back of your neck.

145
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,585
And, I mean, I was on a tour.

146
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,285
There were clanging of chains.

147
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,320
There were things that were going on

148
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:53,926
that absolutely terrified me.

149
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,862
Okay, so, now, after that happened,

150
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,531
did employees come to you with stories?

151
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,301
Oh, they certainly did. They said, you know,

152
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:02,336
"The shutters banged,
but they were secured,"

153
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,672
or, "floor creaking, floorboards,"

154
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,475
all kinds of noises, all kinds of things.

155
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,442
And I would not have
thought I was open to it,

156
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:11,476
but I'm starting to pay
a little more attention.

157
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:18,451
There was a man here.

158
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,222
I think he went crazy.

159
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:26,428
This guy causes issues with,
like, living people,

160
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,430
you know, has, like, tantrums.

161
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:36,275
He'll, like,
run into the wall and the door on purpose.

162
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,212
I'd say this man is the
cause of hundreds of deaths.

163
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:46,122
And it goes back in his family,

164
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:50,293
like he comes from a line of monsters.

165
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,227
Vicious.

166
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,797
Very vicious man.

167
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,333
Very vicious.

168
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:08,746
So, Katherine, I was talking to Daddy,

169
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:12,883
and he told me that you had
an experience that scared you.

170
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,585
Yeah.

171
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,718
Is that right?

172
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,152
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:19,687
Can you tell me what happened?

174
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,822
Well, we were doing the party
for the opening of the play

175
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:28,528
that we talk about what happened
when Annie Palmer was alive.

176
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,196
Okay.

177
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:31,964
And I saw somebody up in
the top of the window.

178
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:39,004
And she had red lipstick with
black markings over her eyes.

179
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:41,373
It couldn't have been somebody
that was in the building?

180
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,374
Mnh-mnh.

181
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:45,582
Just some people at the front bottom.

182
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,483
Okay, but not up here.

183
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,016
Yeah. Not on the top floor.

184
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,153
Now, are you afraid of the building?

185
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,189
Yeah.

186
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,491
I'm never alone when I'm in here.

187
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,532
There's another lady.

188
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,366
She went nuts.

189
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,302
She went crazy.

190
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:10,745
She is seen... a lot.

191
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:18,086
And people, male, female,
kids, will see her around.

192
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,990
Like,
it's always like she's moving along the wall.

193
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:24,896
She's always, like, slithering.

194
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,868
She's kind of spooking me out a little bit.

195
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,712
After meeting with Michael and his family,

196
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:49,181
I started talking to the
employees of Rose Hall.

197
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,550
It shook.

198
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,516
And Mrs. Rollins wasn't kidding.

199
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,592
Everyone had experiences to share.

200
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,092
My back was to the door.

201
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,159
And the door slammed.

202
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:05,760
One that really caught my attention

203
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,663
came from a housekeeper named Becken.

204
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:15,768
A few weeks ago,
right down there, the dungeon,

205
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,902
I go to turn off that light over there.

206
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:20,907
And then I feel like somebody
holding me around the waist.

207
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,941
I say, "In the name of Jesus, you go."

208
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,742
Now, Becken,
you're sure it couldn't have been

209
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:27,611
one of the other employees
playing games with you

210
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:29,981
and grabbing you and then running away?

211
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:31,514
No, nobody was around.

212
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,702
So,
do you think whatever's here is dangerous?

213
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:34,272
Yeah.

214
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:44,463
Crazy Lady makes her whole being felt.

215
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,166
She doesn't just touch them.

216
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:53,706
She wants to engulf them...
and make them feel her.

217
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,411
She makes you very, very nauseous.

218
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:01,513
It hurts so much.

219
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,823
How long have you worked here?

220
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:14,028
I've been here for almost three years.

221
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,995
Have you ever had actual experiences?

222
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,498
I have many experiences.

223
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,567
- You have?
- Yes.

224
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,369
Okay, tell me about them.

225
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,538
We have a lady that plays Annie.

226
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,973
So she stands in Annie Palmer's room,

227
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,012
at her window, looking out at the guests.

228
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,614
There was another lady beside her

229
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:34,016
in a nice silhouette, white dress.

230
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,552
But there was no face.

231
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,854
Okay.

232
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,890
Now, is she solid like the actor,
or was she, like, misty?

233
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:40,158
Yeah, she's misty.

234
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,257
She's ghost-like. Yeah.

235
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,058
Okay.

236
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,294
She mimics everything that our Annie does.

237
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,030
You mean, like, her movements?

238
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,299
Yes.

239
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,101
So, what else have you seen?

240
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,236
I saw a gentleman.

241
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,671
- He was black.
- Okay.

242
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,045
And he had some wounds on his skin.

243
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,880
What kind of wounds are we talking about,

244
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,047
like a burn, a stabbing?

245
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,516
Like, a whip wound. Yes.

246
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,418
Okay, so you're assuming that
he was a slave at some point.

247
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,953
- Yes.
- Okay.

248
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,755
Oh, he followed me downstairs.

249
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,724
And I saw six slaves.

250
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:16,359
I saw one coming from out the dining room,

251
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,331
one from out the morning room,
one from outside,

252
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,730
one from the ballroom.

253
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,964
So they were all coming towards me,

254
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:25,733
and I couldn't move.

255
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,136
The only thing,

256
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,170
the one that came downstairs with me,
he held my hand.

257
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:32,271
Okay.

258
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,138
He held on my hands.

259
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,379
And he said, "Come with me."

260
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,715
Now, I've been doing this a long time.

261
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,048
I've heard a lot of stories.

262
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,682
But this slave story you're
telling me is pretty out there.

263
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:44,686
I know when it's real from when it's not.

264
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:46,521
Did you take it as something dangerous,

265
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,789
or did you take it as...

266
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,560
I thought I was going to die.

267
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,733
A lot of the dead here, they're pissed.

268
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:03,474
The things that these dead
people do to the living

269
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:07,112
could be kind of justifiable

270
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:11,853
because I think a lot of these people

271
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:15,923
might have been tortured and kidnapped.

272
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,595
This was done by the people from here.

273
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:25,063
The dead... may have these guardians.

274
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,063
What are the guardians?

275
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,700
I don't know. They're these big things.

276
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:39,442
I mean, I'd say they're 10, 12 feet tall.

277
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,944
They have long legs.

278
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:48,379
They're on all fours.

279
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,549
Honestly, I've never seen anything like that.
Ever, ever, ever.

280
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,319
How many are there?

281
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:55,589
There's about six or seven of them.

282
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:58,059
It's like a [Bleep] wall of defense.

283
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,759
But they said something like,

284
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:02,260
"Stand back," or, "Don't come near here."

285
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:05,596
They're guarding the dead.

286
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,404
I think that people would have experiences

287
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:13,873
with them over the years.

288
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,143
They're very powerful and dangerous.

289
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:22,147
Do you know if this might affect
people that just work here?

290
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,781
It would just destroy them.

291
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,654
Michael, his mom,
and everyone that works at Rose Hall

292
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,892
has really bought into
this Annie Palmer legend.

293
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,793
You know? It's an incredible story.

294
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:47,927
So I reached out to an author

295
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,362
who has written about the property.

296
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,199
He's out on the island doing research

297
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,301
and agreed to meet me and
separate fact from fiction.

298
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:04,214
So, Ben, the reason I asked
you to help me out on this case

299
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,515
is I know you're an expert on this stuff.

300
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,417
And I got told this story by my client

301
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,318
that I don't know if
there's any truth to it.

302
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,218
Said there was a woman named
Annie Palmer who lived here.

303
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,386
She killed three of her husbands,

304
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,421
as well as countless slaves.

305
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:20,791
And to top it off,
they say she's buried right here.

306
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:22,725
Is any of it true?

307
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:23,826
Almost none of that's true.

308
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,493
Really?

309
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,295
Essentially,
the Annie Palmer that people talk about,

310
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,298
the one that's supposedly
buried here and that lived here,

311
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,966
it was a composite of two different women

312
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:33,535
who lived almost a century apart.

313
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,002
Okay, so, who's the first woman?

314
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:37,472
Well, the very first one was
a woman named Rosa Kelly.

315
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:40,211
The most interesting thing is
that she had four husbands,

316
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,712
and three of them died
here on this property.

317
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:44,415
She was on her fourth husband when she died.

318
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay,
so what happened to the previous husbands?

319
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,520
The very first one is named Henry Fanning.

320
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,653
He was married to her in 1746,

321
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,822
and he died within six months.

322
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:54,959
Okay. Do we know how he died?

323
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:57,060
He died young. We don't know exactly how.

324
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:59,256
You know, this is the tropics.
This is, you know, the 1700s.

325
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,260
People drop dead of malaria,
all sorts of different things.

326
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,661
Okay, so,
people dying young wasn't uncommon.

327
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,662
Exactly. Exactly.

328
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,365
What about the second husband? Who was he?

329
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,302
A man named George Ash.

330
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,004
And how long does that marriage last?

331
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:14,305
That marriage lasted two years,
until he himself dies.

332
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,773
Now, what about the third husband?

333
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,341
The third husband was named Norwood Witter,

334
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,212
and he died 12 years after they married.

335
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,213
Now, how do we know she
didn't murder these people?

336
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,782
Well, there's no record that she did.

337
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,085
All right.

338
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,022
So in-between her husbands,
who's running the plantation?

339
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,189
She was.

340
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,625
This is the 1700s.

341
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:31,762
I mean, this had to be some woman

342
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,329
to take care of a plantation this big.

343
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:34,396
Mm-hmm.

344
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:35,932
You can see how some of the stories

345
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,036
might have come about her
being very strong-willed,

346
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,405
you know, and an important person.

347
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,505
Is it possible she's buried here, Rosa?

348
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,007
No. That's not possible.

349
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,109
Why is that?

350
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,581
Because we know where she was buried.

351
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,683
We have record.

352
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,518
She's buried in St. James' Parish,

353
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,152
which isn't too far from here.

354
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:53,521
Okay,
so the records show that she died in 1790.

355
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:54,888
How old was she by then?

356
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,355
72.

357
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,690
So this is not her?

358
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,395
There may be somebody buried here,
but it ain't her.

359
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:07,296
This lady is way back.

360
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:14,465
I want to go back to, like...
just like, 1700s?

361
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,033
I'm seeing the powerful, angry woman again.

362
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,806
And this time,
she's telling me about her life.

363
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:21,942
She's very wealthy,

364
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:25,544
and she's very in control
and very powerful person,

365
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,916
which is weird because she's a female

366
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:31,350
and this is a long time ago.

367
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:38,691
But, like,
I feel like she owns like everything.

368
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:46,098
She's had her share of enemies,
let me tell you,

369
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,101
who have tried to kill her.

370
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,003
So, you said the legend of this Annie Palmer

371
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,238
is a combination of two women.

372
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,006
All right, so, we got the first woman.

373
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,340
What about the second one?

374
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,575
The second one was actually
named Annie Palmer.

375
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,442
Okay, so there<i> was</i> an Annie Palmer.

376
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:02,078
There<i> was</i> an Annie Palmer,

377
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,312
but there's nothing,

378
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,380
No part of that biography fits her.

379
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,415
The only connection is to her name.

380
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,750
So anything that the legend
says has nothing to do

381
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,152
with the real Annie Palmer.

382
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,155
Essentially, yeah.

383
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,023
All right, so, what do we know about her?

384
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:17,830
Okay, so this is an image of Annie Palmer.

385
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,835
Now, this is her or we think it's her?

386
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:21,202
It's said to be of her.

387
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:22,203
We don't know.

388
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:23,571
It's a painting from that time.

389
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:24,840
We know that she was originally English.

390
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,241
She moved here in 1820.

391
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:30,141
We know that her parents died
when she was fairly young.

392
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,744
Beyond that, she seems to have had

393
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,383
a relatively uneventful upbringing.

394
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,517
Okay, so, what happens with her?

395
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,218
Her husband died in 1827.

396
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,987
Three years later,
she lost the title to the property.

397
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,353
That was basically a year
before the slave rebellion.

398
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,889
After she lost the plantation,

399
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,393
she moved to another part of the island,

400
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,661
and she died in 1846.

401
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:50,696
- And how old was she?
- 34.

402
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:51,998
- Okay. Was she murdered?
- No.

403
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,136
As far as we know, natural causes.

404
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,570
Is it possible she's in here?

405
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:56,837
No, that's not possible.

406
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,271
And how do we know that?

407
00:18:58,273 --> 00:18:59,773
Because we know where she was buried.

408
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:00,775
We have record of that.

409
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:01,910
Okay.

410
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,277
So, she's in the same place...

411
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,780
Yup... as Rosa.

412
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:08,017
Yup. They're both in the same cemetery.

413
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,854
Essentially, none of the stories

414
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,856
of cruelty and sadism and black magic,

415
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:16,224
all the bad things that
people talk about her,

416
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,360
had no relation to the real Annie Palmer.

417
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,195
Okay.

418
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,997
This crazy lady.

419
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,667
She's pretty important.

420
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,270
It's like she's 1860s.

421
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:30,774
She had a lot of losses,
starting really early.

422
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:37,611
This woman,
she went crazy because he father died.

423
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,114
Very attached, very attached to her father.

424
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,313
Very attached.

425
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:49,591
She seems... very not stable right now.

426
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,298
Lots of darkness.

427
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,671
A lot of darkness here.

428
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,599
Ben mentioned a bloody slave
rebellion in Montego Bay.

429
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,199
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

430
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:19,734
who says the fighting came really close

431
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,202
to the property I'm investigating.

432
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,463
So, Nicole, you told me on the phone

433
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:34,783
that the slave rebellion
was the most important

434
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:38,486
and violent event that took
place in Jamaican history.

435
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,690
It was certainly one of the most important.

436
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:48,663
On December 27, 1831,
this emancipation war started.

437
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:52,100
This emancipation war would see

438
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:56,755
60,000 enslaved Africans take arms

439
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,040
against the colonial overlords,

440
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,676
namely the white plantation masters.

441
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,928
Okay, so what kind of a
battle are we talking about?

442
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,046
What would we have seen?

443
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,282
This was a guerrilla fight.

444
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:08,483
Okay.

445
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,152
But it was also armed combat.

446
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,888
Occasionally, the fields were put on fire.

447
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,340
So, Nicole, let me ask you a question,

448
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,925
as far as the property I'm investigating.

449
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:21,062
How close did this whole uprising get to it?

450
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:25,033
Palmyra Plantation,
which was about two miles away, was burnt.

451
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,870
So it was probably likely
that the enslaved Africans,

452
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,572
as well as the white management,

453
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:31,906
if they couldn't see it,

454
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:34,142
they could at least smell what was going on.

455
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,044
So, how long does this rebellion last?

456
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,879
It was actually 10 days.

457
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,749
I'm sure a lot of people
got killed on both sides.

458
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:42,784
Not quite.

459
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:45,453
You see, over 500 people we killed,

460
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:49,190
and 14 of these individuals were white.

461
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,192
Okay, so what did the plantation owners do

462
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:52,861
after they stopped the rebellion?

463
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:56,231
This was actually one of the
most heart-rending part of it.

464
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,435
You see, innocent persons of color

465
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:02,570
could easily be rounded up.

466
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:06,474
312 were judicially executed.

467
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:10,245
Several enslaved Africans
were shot on the spot.

468
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,580
In fact, they executed so many people

469
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,982
that the bodies would pile up.

470
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,401
Eventually, slavery was abolished.

471
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,420
When did that happen here?

472
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,289
The emancipation bill was passed.

473
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:25,326
By August 1, 1834, slavery ended.

474
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,535
I'm seeing a lot of different things here.

475
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:37,906
Like, first I'm feeling, like,
all of this panic and distress.

476
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:41,609
Someone's bleeding, bleeding, cut, stabbed.

477
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:45,580
It feels more like a stab, right here.

478
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:46,948
Right here.

479
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,785
This is a male, young male.

480
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,787
Tongue ripped out.

481
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,990
There's a lot of [Bleep] horrible things

482
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,559
being done to people.

483
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,183
Now that I know the
truth about Annie Palmer

484
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,401
and the bloody slave rebellion,

485
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,002
I need to see if there's anything else

486
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,971
that could help my case.

487
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,589
So I'm at the local library.

488
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:17,745
Searching for old records,
I find a deadly rampage

489
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:20,248
involving a man named Rudolph Franklin.

490
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,051
It turns out,
he lived on Rose Hall property.

491
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:26,921
I'm heading over to meet a
local Rastafarian activist

492
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,890
who knows all about this deadly shoot-out.

493
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:32,477
He told me the information he's
got will be critical to my case.

494
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,069
Mr. Ras Karbi, I appreciate you meeting me.

495
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:44,038
Saw an article during my research

496
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,008
about a shoot-out between
Rastafarians and police

497
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,409
that was pretty deadly.

498
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,028
When I looked at the research,

499
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,813
everything came back to Rose Hall

500
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,715
and the property I'm investigating.

501
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:56,184
So I wanted to find out from you,

502
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,652
if you knew exactly what happened.

503
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:01,589
What actually took place was this guy,
Rudolph Franklin,

504
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:03,708
who used to live on the Rose Hall property

505
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,193
and he was a worker there.

506
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,778
And he's gotten some land

507
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,330
that he claimed that his father's given him.

508
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:12,483
So there was a dispute because
they want him off the land.

509
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,369
Right, Rastas weren't welcome.

510
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,787
Now, did he have any paperwork

511
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,572
documenting that he owned that property?

512
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,140
Most Jamaicans didn't have paperwork

513
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:20,675
that they owned any property.

514
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:23,044
So, now, what happens in 1961,
when the cops do eventually...?

515
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,263
In 1961, a dispute developed.

516
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,565
Rudolph Franklin had his machete, okay?

517
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,017
He was on his property.

518
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,252
And they told him to drop his machete.

519
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:35,189
He perhaps refused to drop the machete,
so he was shot.

520
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,258
And they left him to die in the grass.

521
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,594
So, he survived the shooting.

522
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:42,997
He decided to come back
with a personal grudge

523
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,666
or a personal revenge.

524
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:47,268
So he got some friends together.

525
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,303
So, they went to the gas station.

526
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:50,238
Gas station's set on fire. Cops came.

527
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,107
And there was a big clash

528
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:57,211
between Franklin and his
men and the policemen.

529
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:59,981
You know, what was the outcome
of this whole, big mess?

530
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:04,052
By the time it was over,
eight people got killed.

531
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:07,221
One was... Franklin himself got killed.

532
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:11,693
Two friends that he brought there,
two policemen got shot.

533
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:13,945
One that was assisting the police

534
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,748
also got hacked to death by Franklin's men.

535
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,366
And two other bystanders.

536
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,172
So there's two people.

537
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:26,975
They're both lying on the ground.

538
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:31,779
It's dark out.
There's a fire that's burning.

539
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:37,785
And there's a man who...
is standing over them.

540
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,888
And it's almost like a butchering,

541
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,743
like you would butcher an animal,
like he's being gutted.

542
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,575
I saw several dead people during my walk,

543
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,244
but the bizarre creatures
guarding the dead outside

544
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:06,581
pose the biggest threat.

545
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,217
There were several trees,

546
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,070
and there were these things

547
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:18,292
that were probably like 10 or 12 feet tall.

548
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:22,163
Like a fly with no head.

549
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,132
- And no face?
- No face.

550
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:29,103
It was dark... very, very dark.

551
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,040
Is this what you saw?

552
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,911
Yes, that's what I saw.

553
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:59,792
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

554
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,761
we're ready to reveal our findings

555
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:04,964
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

556
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:06,599
Amy, I'd like you to meet Michael.

557
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:10,436
Now, Michael gave up a banking
job in New York a few years ago

558
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:12,204
to come here and run this historic place,

559
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:15,474
but he got a lot more than he bargained for.

560
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,310
This is his mom, Mrs. Rollins.

561
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:20,479
Back in 1965,
her husband purchased this place.

562
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:24,684
This is what it looked like
when they purchased it.

563
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,821
They spent years restoring
it to what it is today.

564
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:29,989
And this is Janique.

565
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:33,192
She's an employee of Rose Hall.

566
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,728
And she's had more than her
fair share of experiences.

567
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,230
Now, Michael's the one that called us in.

568
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:40,232
Activity's gotten really bad,

569
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,400
and he wants to make sure

570
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:42,868
he can continue on with the family legacy.

571
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,572
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

572
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:48,941
I'm gonna have her describe
what she saw on her walk.

573
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:55,181
When I arrived, there was a lot
of chaos that was happening.

574
00:27:55,183 --> 00:28:00,820
I immediately encountered a
male who is bound by his leg,

575
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:05,992
and he was telling me how he
had been here for a long time.

576
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:09,862
But he was someone who was
treated really like an animal.

577
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,732
Then, right after him,

578
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:17,803
I saw people were lined
up and then set on fire.

579
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:21,207
Then they were just kind
of scattered and running,

580
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,743
while they are engulfed in flames.

581
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:30,249
I think that this happened a very,
very long time ago.

582
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,518
That's pretty easy to explain.

583
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,222
I mean, this place was a slave
plantation back in the 1700s.

584
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,692
At its peak, it had 500 slaves

585
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:41,694
that lived, died, and were buried here.

586
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:46,298
Now, you saw a lot of violence and a fire.

587
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,550
Yeah.

588
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,769
Now,
it kind of sounds like you're talking about

589
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:53,172
the slave rebellion that took
place on December 27, 1831.

590
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:55,541
Now, the slaves burnt down the plantation

591
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:58,077
and took up arms to fight for their freedom.

592
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,879
Battle lasted 10 days.

593
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,714
Slaves were crushed.

594
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:05,017
221 died during that 10-day battle.

595
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,820
Only 14 of those 221 were white.

596
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:10,890
Now, afterwards, the whites that
were here were out for blood.

597
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:12,892
They wind up rounding up any blacks

598
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:15,995
they could find on the streets,
threw them in jail, tried them,

599
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,964
and 312 were executed.

600
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,633
Even though the whites won that battle,

601
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:21,801
they lost the war

602
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,269
because slavery was abolished in 1834 here.

603
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:29,338
Now, Janique,
you had experiences with slaves.

604
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,437
Yeah.

605
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,272
Explain to Amy what you encountered.

606
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:33,841
So, I went upstairs,

607
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,576
and I was cleaning the commode.

608
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,578
And there was a gentlemen behind me.

609
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,746
You know, he's black.

610
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:41,181
He had wounds on his skin,

611
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:42,766
and he grabbed my hand.

612
00:29:42,768 --> 00:29:45,719
And he was saying, "Come with me."

613
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:48,972
After a few minutes or so,
there was a gentleman

614
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,625
coming from all corners of the house,

615
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,694
about four of them, all slaves.

616
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,229
It seems all wounded.

617
00:29:55,231 --> 00:30:00,501
I was afraid that I might
have died or something.

618
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:05,856
So, what else happened on your walk?

619
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:09,076
I encountered this one guy.

620
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,045
This is his favorite area.

621
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:20,154
He was very angry, a very forceful person.

622
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:24,558
This guy causes issues with,
like, living people.

623
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,561
You know? Has, like, tantrums.

624
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:34,868
He'll, like,
run into the wall and the door on purpose.

625
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,439
You've had a lot of people
telling you they hear footsteps?

626
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,973
I've had people telling me

627
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:41,975
that they'll be on the second floor.

628
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:44,211
And they'll hear things downstairs.

629
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:46,313
There's a lot of activity,
a lot of movement,

630
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:48,615
and all of that without people really here.

631
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:49,650
Mm-hmm.

632
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:50,984
Yeah, that's how he operates.

633
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:56,590
So, what else did you see?

634
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:59,259
There were two women that
I encountered on my walk.

635
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:04,064
The first one was extremely old,
very, very wealthy.

636
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:07,701
She is from probably 1600s, 1700s.

637
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:10,921
She was someone who was a decision-maker

638
00:31:10,923 --> 00:31:12,973
and could implement power,

639
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,710
and from my knowledge,
as a woman at<i> that</i> time,

640
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:18,345
that didn't happen.

641
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:20,914
She was in control.

642
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,550
Now, you've heard stories for years,
right, Mrs. Rollins,

643
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,686
about people seeing an
apparition of a woman.

644
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:26,720
Yes.

645
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,990
Michael, you had told me your
daughter saw an apparition.

646
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:31,358
Was it upstairs?

647
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,894
Yeah, upstairs in the far bedroom,
in the far corner.

648
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:35,696
Which would be?

649
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:37,064
- Annie's room.
- Right.

650
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:39,700
Now's probably a good time to tell Amy

651
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:42,669
about the legend of Annie Palmer

652
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,905
that everybody at this
table believes is true

653
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:48,008
and everybody in town does,
including my cab driver.

654
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,062
Supposedly, she was a tyrannical
and sadistic slave owner

655
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,114
who ruled with an iron fist.

656
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:56,116
She murdered three of her husbands,

657
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:59,353
as well as countless slaves.

658
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:01,255
Apparently, she's also buried
right here on the property.

659
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:04,725
But, Amy, this is only the legend.

660
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,593
I did my own research,

661
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,228
and I'll tell you about it in a minute.

662
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,465
Michael,
tell Amy about the Annie Palmer tours

663
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:12,733
you run at night.

664
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,735
As of close to two years ago,

665
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,503
we started doing tours at night.

666
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:18,405
People started hearing things,

667
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:20,574
feeling as if a presence was there.

668
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:22,476
They've actually been touched.

669
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,261
And then, in the most extreme cases,

670
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:26,046
people felt as if they were pushed.

671
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:27,748
Are you doing reenactments?

672
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,083
Yeah, there are aspects of reenactments.

673
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:37,591
Are you doing any of...
the bad stuff that happened?

674
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:39,393
I mean, we designed the night tour

675
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:42,162
so that we could bring a story to life.

676
00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:44,565
We never dreamt the
spirits would do it for us.

677
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:50,437
Now,
who was the second woman you saw?

678
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:53,807
The other woman that I met, who was younger,

679
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:58,178
from around 1860,
her family... extremely wealthy.

680
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,447
She was very well-taken-care-of.

681
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,816
She had definite father issues.

682
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:06,537
I do think that people
see her on the staircase.

683
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,323
I think they would see her along the walls.

684
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,792
She does like to be felt.

685
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,928
So she'll literally put
her whole physical self

686
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,930
around a person.

687
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,267
Now, I think I can clear this stuff up.

688
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,136
I talked to an expert who
wrote about Rose Hall.

689
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:25,672
He says the legend of Annie
Palmer is mostly false.

690
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:35,682
That legend may be the
combination of two women

691
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,384
that lived on this property
at two different times.

692
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:44,558
The first woman, Rosa Palmer,
came here in 1746.

693
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,760
Now, Rosa had four husbands,

694
00:33:46,762 --> 00:33:50,764
and three of them died
right here on this property.

695
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:53,467
There's no indication that
any of them were murdered.

696
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:55,269
She was also a very strong woman

697
00:33:55,271 --> 00:33:58,205
because she had to run the
plantation in-between husbands.

698
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,873
So, this is another aspect

699
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,142
of what you said about the first woman.

700
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:04,778
When she married her fourth husband,
they built this house,

701
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,680
and that's who he named it after.

702
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,382
Her name was Rosa. They named it Rose Hall.

703
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:12,286
Rosa Palmer died right
here in Rose Hall in 1790,

704
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:15,822
at the age of 72, but she's not buried here.

705
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:22,796
Now, right here I have the
burial records for Rosa Palmer.

706
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:25,315
She's buried at the St. James Church,

707
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,017
about nine miles from you.

708
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:33,340
Now, the second woman...
she was actually named Annie Palmer,

709
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:35,943
but the similarities end there.

710
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,312
According to the author I spoke to,

711
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:42,015
this is supposed to be the only
known image of Annie Palmer.

712
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:50,674
You said she had daddy issues.

713
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,025
Her father died young.

714
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,694
She moved here in 1820.

715
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:56,530
Her husband dies in 1827.

716
00:34:56,532 --> 00:35:00,167
Now, in 1846,
Annie Palmer died sick and broke

717
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:03,270
on another part of the
island at the age of 34.

718
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,272
Now, is that her buried outside there? No.

719
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:07,441
I mean, I have another doc that says

720
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:11,478
she's buried in the same
church cemetery as Rosa.

721
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,981
I'm just shocked.

722
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,317
It's a lot of information.

723
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,053
The story's overwhelming.

724
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:23,657
You can't change a legend.

725
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,075
Let me ask you a question.
You saw the two women, right?

726
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:26,193
Yes.

727
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:29,830
Does this look like who you might've seen?

728
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:33,700
It does look<i> similar</i>
to the needy lady.

729
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:38,872
Obviously, there's a huge mystery here.

730
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:44,244
And I don't think that anyone is
going to resolve this mystery.

731
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:49,249
But from Steve's research that he presented,

732
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:52,786
I need to just go with my gut.

733
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:57,024
I think that this very strong,
independent woman

734
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,659
is possibly Rosa Palmer.

735
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:03,430
I think the male that's here is probably

736
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:08,635
one of her former husbands
that she may have killed.

737
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:15,308
As for the younger female that
I encountered, this female,

738
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:20,914
possibly Annie Palmer because
she had father issues,

739
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,851
and she is extraordinarily needy.

740
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:27,554
Well,
I think we need to really take a close look

741
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:29,222
at doing as much as we can

742
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:31,658
in order to not provoke something

743
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,276
that has the ability to be awful.

744
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:40,767
One of the things that
I find very concerning

745
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:44,638
is what I encountered in the backyard.

746
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,440
And the interesting thing was

747
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:49,476
that there were guardians of the dead.

748
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,965
These things said to me to stay
back and not to come there.

749
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:58,185
They're about 12 feet tall,

750
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:02,923
black body, bizarre arms and legs.

751
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:05,826
They're very odd-looking.

752
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:08,995
So I did do a sketch of what I saw.

753
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,831
I'm dying to see what
these things look like.

754
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:21,508
Well, you weren't kidding
when you said this is weird.

755
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,177
This is what you got in your backyard,
just so you know.

756
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,846
Oh.

757
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:27,581
They're horrific.

758
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:32,285
They're capable, really,
of anything, including death.

759
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,065
This is what you got in your backyard,
just so you know.

760
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,831
Oh.

761
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,566
They're horrific.

762
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:59,271
They're capable, really,
of anything, including death.

763
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:10,582
So,
what do we need to do to make it all stop?

764
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:14,620
The guardians... they're making sure

765
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:19,241
that nothing bad happens to the
dead that were unjustly killed.

766
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:24,963
And if these dead people feel threatened,

767
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:27,332
they would reach out to these guardians

768
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:31,603
and allow them to protect them.

769
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:34,122
All right, well, I got to ask,

770
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:37,476
I mean, you think his nighttime shows here

771
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:38,677
are causing a problem?

772
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,579
Yeah, that's what I'm saying
is I'm nervous about that.

773
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:42,948
Well, that makes me nervous, so...

774
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,683
The picture that you just showed.

775
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:50,822
Well, Michael,
you're a successful guy,

776
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:54,493
and I'm sure you got that way
by tackling problems head on.

777
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:57,329
And right now there's a problem here.

778
00:38:57,331 --> 00:39:00,365
So the big question is,
can you keep your father's legacy alive

779
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:03,335
while ensuring the safety of
your employees, your guests,

780
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:05,037
and your family?

781
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,488
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

782
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,456
and see what she can tell us.

783
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:14,379
As far as the dead are concerned,

784
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,548
I do believe that some of the reenactments

785
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,617
probably need to cease.

786
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,385
It is causing them stress.

787
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:24,690
So I think that that needs to be curtailed.

788
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,391
So we want to make them
as comfortable as possible

789
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:28,961
until they're able to go on.

790
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:32,598
But as far as the guardians are concerned,

791
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,349
offerings need to be made.

792
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:37,019
Maybe once a month,

793
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,838
bringing flowers and putting them out there.

794
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,708
While you're doing this,
all you're saying is,

795
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,578
"I respect what you're doing. Thank you."

796
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,297
That's it.

797
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,684
Now, what do they do
about the two women you saw?

798
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:55,921
Rosa Palmer, with her three husbands,

799
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:59,358
bring in a medium to talk to her and say,
you know,

800
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,195
"Look, let's do this nice.

801
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:04,479
"I can help you.

802
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:07,366
I can help guide you to
move on and this and this."

803
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:08,767
I hope that goes well.

804
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:13,438
All right, so now what about the
second one with daddy issues?

805
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,012
Okay, so that person,
who could possibly be Annie Palmer,

806
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:25,133
I think that she actually will
be the easiest person to go.

807
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:26,485
She is looking for love.

808
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:30,022
And I think that a medium
who could connect with her

809
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:33,625
would be able to talk to her,
communicate with her

810
00:40:33,627 --> 00:40:35,827
and let her know that it's okay

811
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:39,581
and that she'll be reunited with
those that she's looking for

812
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,300
and has always been looking for and lost.

813
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:44,786
The male is honestly going to be

814
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:47,839
the most difficult person to remove.

815
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:49,908
In order to remove him,

816
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:56,331
you would need to have a
priest come and do an exorcism.

817
00:40:57,785 --> 00:40:59,084
He is not budging.

818
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,453
But I always thought an exorcism

819
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:04,423
was the removal of the devil from a person.

820
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:07,359
An exorcism can be done

821
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:12,831
when a dead person is<i>
refusing</i> to leave.

822
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,400
He's going to have be forcefully,

823
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:17,335
unfortunately, removed.

824
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:22,507
Now, to keep your father's
legacy alive and to respect it,

825
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:24,710
are you gonna at least do
what Amy tells you to do?

826
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,796
We need to do that to protect people

827
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:30,749
who are visiting at our invitation

828
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:32,918
and our family and Dad's legacy.

829
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,284
So if that's what it takes to
keep Rose Hall Great House,

830
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:41,551
safe and alive... Then I think
of course we'll do that.

831
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:44,759
I think, we don't have choice.

832
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:51,087
Presenting offering to these creatures
shouldn't be taken lightly,

833
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:53,111
as they pose a very serious danger.

834
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,765
But I believe if Michael and
his mother follow my advice,

835
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:59,816
the dead will be set free,
and his family's legacy

836
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,916
can continue safely for
generations to come.
