1
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:14,858
These tricksters are awful... awful, awful.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,328
I saw three shadow figures
here at the foot of the bed.

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,599
They're making them see things,
hear things, feel things.

4
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,868
She found him hanging from the rafters.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,470
Something just goes "Boom!"

6
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,073
This is some bizarre [bleep]
you guys are talking about.

7
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,143
I don't know what to trust.

8
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:37,080
He's making me crazy.

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,783
Something bad's going to happen.

10
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:42,686
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,054
There's panic.

12
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,489
And it's almost like a butchering.

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,556
I see dead people.

14
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,692
They all died horribly.

15
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:50,394
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:51,795
Get out of here.

17
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:53,430
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,465
Vicious.

19
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:58,602
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,303
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

21
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:01,872
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,507
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,409
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,110
This guy's a real piece of work.

25
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:10,781
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,282
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

27
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,450
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,719
This is not good.

29
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,487
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,489
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,258
Until the very end...

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,726
I want my life back.

33
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:24,928
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,730
Is he trying to kill her?

35
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:27,998
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,533
Oh, my god.

37
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,034
This is going to kill us.

38
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,287
I'm in the rural town of Independence,
Oregon.

39
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,255
It's about an hour south of Portland.

40
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,725
I got called in by a guy named Terry,

41
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,794
who sounded really desperate on the phone.

42
00:01:57,796 --> 00:02:01,364
He says the activity in
his farmhouse is so bad,

43
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,633
it's destroying his health
<i>and</i> his relationship.

44
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:06,937
He says if we can't help him,

45
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,039
he doesn't think he's
gonna last another year.

46
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:18,231
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

47
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,368
of anything that might
influence her findings.

48
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,454
Photos need to be removed...

49
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:27,357
and personal items covered.

50
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,608
When I'm finished,

51
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,661
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:46,143
Okay. Okay.

53
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:49,246
I had a really hard time opening.

54
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:53,300
The thing was, was that there were,
like, these tricksters.

55
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:58,288
They are treacherous... thieves and liars.

56
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,223
They're creating illusions,

57
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:04,227
and they are going into people's dreams.

58
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:06,796
What the [bleep]

59
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:10,934
They're having bad, horrible dreams.

60
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,420
This is not good.

61
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,899
Terry, I'm glad I'm here,

62
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,350
'cause when we spoke on the phone,

63
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:28,652
you sounded pretty desperate.

64
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:31,087
What exactly is going on in the house?

65
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,256
Oh, gosh. We hear voices.

66
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:34,758
There's full-body apparitions.

67
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,561
I've been chased down the hallway.

68
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:41,765
I just feel like something's here

69
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,950
trying to suck the life out of me.

70
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:45,235
Wow.

71
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,570
So, who exactly lives in the house?

72
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:50,740
Me, my partner, Bobby,
and my grandson, Ashton.

73
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,777
I think it's now starting
after my grandson.

74
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,447
All right.
So, how long have you been living here?

75
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,416
We've been here four years.

76
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,084
What made you come here?

77
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,520
With my parents being elderly,
Bobby and I decided

78
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,106
that it would probably be
best if we moved down here

79
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,391
to help take care of
the farm and my parents.

80
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:10,694
Okay. So, did you grow up in this house?

81
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,063
No. This house has been moved here.

82
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,466
We had an old farmhouse over
there that I grew up in.

83
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,767
Okay.

84
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,737
Things have progressively gotten
worse over this last year.

85
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,639
I've been attacked in my bed.

86
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,742
I'm getting no sleep... none.

87
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:29,112
I get very irritable
when my anxiety goes up.

88
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:30,614
I know on the phone, when we spoke,

89
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,749
it seems like your
relationship's a little strained

90
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,551
because of this stuff that's going on.

91
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,920
It<i> is</i> a little strained.
I don't want to be bothered.

92
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:40,590
I just kind of want to be alone,
and that's not me at all.

93
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,025
Now, what about your grandson?

94
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,661
He is so scared,
he won't go to the bath alone.

95
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,596
He doesn't want to sleep alone.

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:53,937
I don't know how to protect my family.

98
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,672
Yeah.

99
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,974
I am at my wits' end.

100
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,550
What the hell?

101
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,389
There's a man...

102
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,524
Oh, a living dude.

103
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,893
He's just, like, barreling through here

104
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,428
and yelling and screaming.

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,998
And he's got brown hair.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,801
Kind of got a round face,
kind of a roundish face.

107
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,536
Kind of, like, always a mess.

108
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,438
How old?

109
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,774
Probably in his early 40s.

110
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:31,808
Okay.

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,344
Not a happy person.

112
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:42,686
Okay, now I'm seeing a bunch of [bleep]

113
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,992
I think there's a [bleep] telepath here

114
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:53,863
who is inadvertently
manipulating their environment.

115
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:54,864
How?

116
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,950
Like, the living people here

117
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:59,853
are seeing things that aren't really there.

118
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:03,506
He's making me crazy.

119
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,984
One of my very first
really scary experiences

120
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,419
happened here.

121
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,854
I used to have a mirror

122
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:21,458
that hung in my bedroom at
the end of this hallway,

123
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,793
and I was coming through one afternoon

124
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,162
with a load of towels from the laundry,

125
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,531
and I just got this overwhelming feeling

126
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,367
that somebody was behind me.

127
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,703
And as I happened to
look up down the hallway

128
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,940
and into that mirror,
I saw an old man behind me,

129
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,275
I would say probably in his 70s.

130
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:42,612
He was kind of see-through,
more of, like, a gray thing,

131
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:46,850
and he was coming behind
me down the hallway.

132
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:51,521
I ran and slammed the
bedroom door behind me.

133
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:53,640
Could it have been an intruder
or anything like that?

134
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,924
No.

135
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:57,861
I open the door back up...
There's nothing here.

136
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:00,230
Interesting. Okay,
so what else is going on in this hallway?

137
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,565
I hear women's voices
out in the living room.

138
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,968
It's like a murmuring.

139
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,670
You just kind of hear...

140
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,671
That's annoying.

141
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:09,739
Very.

142
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,508
How many people would you think it is?

143
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,276
Probably three to four.

144
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,577
Do you go investigate?

145
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,995
Yes, I usually get up.

146
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:18,948
There have been times I've
been kind of confrontational.

147
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,116
And what have you said?

148
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,851
"Get out of my house."

149
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:23,219
And what happens?

150
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,888
It makes it worse.

151
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,256
They're bullying me.

152
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,625
I never had circles under my eyes

153
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:31,561
until I came back here
and moved into this house.

154
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:32,729
Okay.

155
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:43,406
Oh, boy.

156
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,513
These, like, trickster things...

157
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:53,550
there's a lot of them... a lot of them.

158
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,135
How many?

159
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,422
50?

160
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:04,828
But I don't know if I'm...
seeing the truth.

161
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:11,000
These tricksters are incredibly
good at distorting reality.

162
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:16,506
Between them and the telepathy,
the living must be going insane.

163
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:20,310
They'll feed into the
person's paranoias and fears.

164
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:24,714
They can reach in and pull out past traumas

165
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,650
and make it a fresh issue for them,

166
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:31,187
and they, like, overanalyze it
and analyze it and analyze it,

167
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:32,655
talking, talking, talking,

168
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:35,258
and it's like feeding it
more and more and more.

169
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:48,838
One night,
I woke up and I saw three shadow figures

170
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,857
down here at the foot of the bed

171
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,576
that I would say were
probably about this tall

172
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,447
and looked like black blobs...
kind of human shape.

173
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:01,217
I freaked out, jumped up out of bed,
and I ran out.

174
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:03,186
I was scared to death.

175
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:06,055
You're sure there's no shadows
coming in from outside?

176
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:08,224
Those are block-out curtains,
and they're closed.

177
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,226
Huh.

178
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,328
Actually, after we had called you,

179
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,332
the other night,
I got attacked in my bed again.

180
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,134
I was watching TV.

181
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:21,437
I rolled over to grab
the remote, and again,

182
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,324
there was a large shadow
figure standing over me,

183
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:25,975
leaning in the bed.

184
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:27,393
I started swinging.

185
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:30,880
I thought maybe somebody
had broken into the house.

186
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,116
And it just disappeared.

187
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,035
When you said you were desperate,
you weren't kidding.

188
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:39,172
No. It feels like I'm being tortured.

189
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,695
I feel sick... horrible,
horrible [bleep] sick in here.

190
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,130
Awful, awful, awful.

191
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:49,799
These tricksters,

192
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,969
they are causing their own mayhem here.

193
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:54,871
Are you okay?

194
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:58,174
They're [bleep] with me.

195
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,609
Real physical. Okay [bleep]

196
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,244
Ah. Come on. Come on.

197
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:05,982
They come. They come. They come.

198
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,450
And they do. They surround...

199
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:09,786
They do... They do it...
They'll surround any bed

200
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,821
that has a living person in them at night.

201
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,260
They're like this big, and they're black...

202
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:20,430
you know, black humanoid figures.

203
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:23,783
And they all are standing together.

204
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,273
They come in the front door.
They crawl out of the closets.

205
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:35,211
They're attracted to the
negativity in this house.

206
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,781
They're having a good time feeding this.

207
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:41,618
It's not like they're like,
"I'm gonna kill this person,

208
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,553
but if something happens, great.

209
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,055
That would be [bleep] entertaining."

210
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:49,459
They're like, "Yeah, let's keep this going.

211
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:50,293
Let's do this!"

212
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,059
Terry mentioned to me

213
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,678
about his short tempers, his mood swings.

214
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,263
Have you noticed what he's talking about?

215
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,514
Yeah.

216
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,516
In the beginning,
when we first got together,

217
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:24,536
he was so lovable and just happy.

218
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,421
Just watching somebody go downhill,

219
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,723
you don't want to see it.

220
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,758
And there's a couple of times

221
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,161
where I've actually, like,
wanted to just walk away.

222
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:34,496
Okay.

223
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:38,100
Now, what about yourself?
What have you experienced?

224
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:39,868
I have seen something that
actually terrifies me.

225
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,786
Okay.

226
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,637
It's a little shadow figure.

227
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,308
It's probably about 2 feet tall,
about up to your knee,

228
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,977
and it peeks around the corner at you.

229
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:53,281
It's got kind of like a troll-
or gremlin-looking shape to it,

230
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:55,584
with pointed ears.

231
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,420
You don't think it's any kind of
an animal or anything like that?

232
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,788
You sure of that?

233
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,990
It's too big to be any kind of rodent.

234
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,358
Okay.

235
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,527
And you would have heard it
if it was some animal, huh?

236
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,012
Yeah. There's no sound to it.

237
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,464
Is there anything else going on?

238
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,299
I saw this little fawn

239
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:14,269
actually hop through the
back window in the bedroom,

240
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:17,005
and it went through the bedroom

241
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,007
and then took off down the hallway.

242
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,642
You're talking about a baby deer?

243
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:21,910
Yeah.

244
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:24,045
This is some bizarre [bleep]
you guys are talking about.

245
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,781
I haven't heard this
much stuff in one house.

246
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:28,316
I thought I was going crazy at one point.

247
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:29,885
- Were you boozing?
- No. I don't drink.

248
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,620
You don't drink? All right. Any drugs?

249
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:32,687
Nope.

250
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,773
I have no idea what that could have been.

251
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,792
You can see why I thought
I was going crazy.

252
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,714
I'm having a lot of issues

253
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:47,435
trying to figure out what
is really going on here.

254
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:53,575
But these tricksters...
They<i> are</i> causing issues.

255
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:57,145
Like, there's infinite possibilities

256
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,281
of how they can manipulate the living

257
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:04,286
into making them, you know,
behave in a certain way

258
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:10,158
or, you know, see things,
hear things, feel things.

259
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,777
They're causing, you know, fighting.

260
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,014
They'll pit people against
each other so they'll fight.

261
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:18,600
They'll cause a lot of arguments and anger.

262
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:26,308
One person will hear the
other person talking to them,

263
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,310
but it's not them.

264
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:31,646
They manipulate dreams.

265
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:37,219
They are making it a very negative,
volatile situation.

266
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:40,822
And they are really feeding at night.

267
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,366
So, Ashton, I talked to Grandpa,

268
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:53,768
and he's worried about you.

269
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,770
He wanted me to talk to you.

270
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:56,838
How old are you, exactly?

271
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,839
7.

272
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:59,507
7? Okay.

273
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,676
Do you see anything in the
house that frightens you?

274
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:05,881
Tell me about that.

275
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:09,301
I saw something come through the closet...

276
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,119
the closet in that room.

277
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,589
It was like red eyes,

278
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,158
and it was like a demon or something.

279
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:21,496
And it came on my side of the bed,

280
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:25,333
and I felt something
tickling me right here.

281
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,569
Are you afraid to stay here?

282
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:30,405
You are?

283
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:33,124
Why are you afraid? Tell me.

284
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:38,179
Because I see stuff moving in
the hallway and the bathroom.

285
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,714
What are you seeing?

286
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,384
All night, I see, like, a tall man.

287
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,353
I stay up almost all night.

288
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:55,130
The little trickster dudes
are different in here.

289
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,166
They're more active in here
as far as what they do.

290
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:05,206
Here, they're more aggressive.

291
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,175
They're, like, jumping on the bed

292
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,828
like they're having a good time,

293
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,180
barking and growling.

294
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:16,351
And I see, like...

295
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:19,187
I see somebody's in there.
Somebody's in the bed.

296
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,992
And they're trying to relax.

297
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,660
They're seeing, like...

298
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,464
Like, um...

299
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,700
Uh, like, all this movement, like lights...

300
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,404
and, like, you know, black,
streaky things and lights

301
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:38,306
and, like, all this chaos.

302
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:43,078
And they're just like, "Oh, man.
This is really bad."

303
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,124
Terry and Bobby have no clue

304
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,976
about the history of their house,

305
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,277
so I pulled the property deed

306
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,246
and asked a local historian that I know

307
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:05,981
to look through some of the names.

308
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,984
Turns out the original property owner

309
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:10,152
was publicly disgraced

310
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,354
and had to leave Independence in shame.

311
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,827
Well, Diane,
I appreciate you helping me out.

312
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,213
So, what can you tell me
about this guy Alva Shaw,

313
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,332
who originally owned my clients' property?

314
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:27,952
He was born in New York about 1819,

315
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,772
and he came to Oregon in 1844.

316
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,401
Okay. So, what did he do when he got here?

317
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,335
He was appointed by the governor
to be the superintendent

318
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:36,404
of the state penitentiary in Portland.

319
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:39,935
Okay, I mean,
that's a pretty prestigious job

320
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:40,801
and powerful job.

321
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,234
- He's got to have a lot of connections.
- He did.

322
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,381
How'd it work out?

323
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,639
Of the 154 prisoners

324
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,673
that were sent to the
prison during his term,

325
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,377
44 of them escaped,
and only 13 were recaptured.

326
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,168
So 1/3 of his prisoners escaped?

327
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,120
Yes. He was blamed for that.

328
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:57,137
Okay.

329
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,947
As soon as I walk outside,

330
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,783
it's like a haze has been lifted off of me,

331
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:12,152
and I'm able to see clearly again,

332
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:15,322
and there's someone here,
watching my every move.

333
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:21,895
I think that he's a dead man...
a very powerful man.

334
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:27,835
I think he had a lot of power
that was placed upon him,

335
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,604
a lot of strength, a lot of determination,

336
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,706
a lot of authority, and I think that's why

337
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,576
he's so capable of manifesting this way.

338
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:40,514
Do you know when he's from?

339
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,932
80 to 100 years ago?

340
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:42,950
Okay.

341
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:45,586
Do people experience him in any way?

342
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:47,988
I would assume so,

343
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,891
'cause he does have a
thing with the tricksters.

344
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:54,678
You know,
the only thing I could possibly say

345
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,364
is that he would be some kind of leader.

346
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:00,484
Now, you mentioned this
guy had a bad go of things.

347
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,069
- What are we talking about?
- He did.

348
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:06,206
He had a very bad go of things,
starting in August 1866.

349
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:10,077
First thing that happened is
his mother died... Hannah Shaw.

350
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,545
Okay.

351
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:15,616
She died on August 12th,
and she was 71 years old.

352
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,751
And she was buried on your clients'
property.

353
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,486
- She's buried on the property?
- Yes.

354
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,523
Eight days after his mom dies,

355
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:25,542
he hands in his resignation
as superintendent,

356
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:27,961
effective at the end of the month.

357
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,230
So, did his mom dying have
anything to do with him resigning?

358
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:31,565
You know, it's possible.

359
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:35,402
With just four days left in
his term would come the event

360
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:39,006
that would drive him out
of Independence forever.

361
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:41,341
On August 27th, he's taken hostage

362
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:46,046
with two of his employees by nine prisoners

363
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,714
and were going to use them as shields

364
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,816
to get out of the prison.

365
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,751
And as they're marching,

366
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,986
seeing that something needed to be done,

367
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:55,722
Shaw grabs ahold of a fence,

368
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,525
and it breaks the momentum of the escape,

369
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:01,829
and the guards are able
to shoot at the prisoners.

370
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,413
That's a pretty ballsy move on his part.

371
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:06,266
It was, and one of the prisoners is killed,

372
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:09,770
and eight of them escape,
although five are recaptured.

373
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,538
The hostage standoff was big news.

374
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,324
Here's an article about it that
was in the local newspaper.

375
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,427
All right.

376
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,180
So, it sounds like this guy
finally did something right.

377
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,549
The public didn't see it that way.

378
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:26,119
In this editorial,
they blame him for the escape.

379
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,838
They say that he was too liberal,

380
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,407
that he left the shackles off the prisoners

381
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,493
when he should have left them on,

382
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,711
that he didn't have adequate security.

383
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,597
And after the escape,

384
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,500
he feels like he's a
pariah in the community,

385
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:41,702
and he sells the property that he has left,

386
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:43,370
and he moves to California.

387
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,539
Now, how old was he when he died?

388
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,640
He was about 64.

389
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,841
So, what does he die of?

390
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:48,976
We don't know.

391
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,344
The obituary just says

392
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:53,046
that he died of an illness
that lasted 13 hours.

393
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,781
Oh. Okay.

394
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,051
Do you know how he died?

395
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,687
It wasn't the way he expected or wanted.

396
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:04,358
I think he would have liked
to go out in a blaze of glory.

397
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:10,664
He's really affecting a large area,
you know?

398
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,133
I don't think it's just<i> that</i> house.

399
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,256
I think he does go into homes,

400
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,425
and I think he spies a lot.

401
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:27,331
He might be attracted to that
negativity of the living.

402
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,517
But I do feel like he has ill intent here.

403
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:47,539
So far, I know the previous
owner of my clients' property

404
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,909
was run out of town and died
from a mysterious illness.

405
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,411
But I need to see

406
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:54,446
if there's anything else
that could help my case.

407
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,983
Searching through old records,

408
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:00,252
I find a deadly fight between two neighbors

409
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:03,188
right next to Terry and Bobby's property.

410
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,959
I want to know more about this deadly feud,

411
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,878
so I've reached out to
a local police sheriff

412
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,163
to look into it for me,

413
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,099
and he told me that this
was a controversial case

414
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:16,468
and that it tore the community apart.

415
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,776
Well, Sheriff Wolfe,
thanks for meeting with me

416
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,211
and helping me out with the case.

417
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:27,879
The reason I got ahold of you is

418
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,449
because of this article I
came across about a homicide

419
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,451
that happened very close to my clients'
property.

420
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,020
This was a neighborhood
feud between two gentlemen,

421
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:38,256
O.P. Beardsley and T.L. Perryman.

422
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:43,795
And in 1886,
we ended up with the first violent attack,

423
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:47,699
and it was Perryman that ended up

424
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,435
attacking Beardsley with a monkey wrench

425
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:55,240
and caused a pretty
significant gash to him.

426
00:21:55,242 --> 00:22:00,645
And then, in 1888,
Beardsley is walking with a cane,

427
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:04,416
and Perryman comes across
him and attacks him

428
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:08,420
and actually breaks several of his ribs,

429
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:13,258
puts a big gash on his head,
and dislocates an eye.

430
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,559
Now, do we have any idea

431
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,094
what the hell they were
fighting about to begin with?

432
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:17,846
No one really seems to know.

433
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:20,699
They just had a real
dislike for each other.

434
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:23,034
All right, so, now we got this guy Perryman

435
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:25,303
giving Beardsley two beatings already...

436
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:26,972
<i>bad</i> beatings, it sounds like.

437
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,006
Yes, very bad.

438
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,341
But, according to the article,

439
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:31,710
Perryman is the victim of the homicide,

440
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:33,295
so what happened?

441
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:36,131
Well, March 14th of 1889...

442
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,149
Okay.

443
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,818
Perryman comes out

444
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,854
and does a staredown with Beardsley,

445
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,857
who is working on a fence
with some other folks.

446
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,059
Thinking he might have
another beating coming,

447
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:50,228
Beardsley ends up going to the house...

448
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,863
Okay... and he gets a gun.

449
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:55,500
Beardsley goes back outside,
and Beardsley shoots him.

450
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,636
Just like that? There's no altercation?

451
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:59,638
Just shoots him in the street.

452
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,056
And, apparently, was shot

453
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:04,359
once in the heart and once in the back.

454
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:05,744
Oh, geez. Okay.

455
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,878
So, what happens next?

456
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,964
Oh, he turned himself in to the sheriff.

457
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,365
Did it go to trial?

458
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,416
Yes, it did.

459
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,919
He was found not guilty and acquitted.

460
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,040
How's this guy not guilty

461
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,092
when he shoots a guy down in cold blood?

462
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,595
A jury of his peers must have felt

463
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:25,530
that he was defending himself.

464
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:33,738
I'm feeling, like, an impact...

465
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,873
in my back.

466
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,441
Uh...

467
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:41,413
And it's like a wall,
like something just goes "Boom!"

468
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:45,183
It was daytime.
It was the middle of the day.

469
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:49,387
He's probably in his late 30s or early 40s.

470
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:53,024
And it totally shocks him... like,
totally out of the blue.

471
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,980
Terry mentioned that his
house was physically picked up

472
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:00,165
and moved at one point.

473
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:03,401
So I checked into it, and he's right.

474
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:05,170
It was moved about 18 miles from here.

475
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:07,439
I've reached out to an old friend of mine,

476
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:10,158
Jeff Davis, who's an author,
and he said he's got information

477
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,860
that will definitely help my case.

478
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:20,785
All right, so, this is the property

479
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,388
that the house I'm
investigating was moved from?

480
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,290
Yes, it was built here and then moved

481
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:28,293
about 17 or 18 miles to
where you first saw it.

482
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:30,378
You had mentioned on the phone

483
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,814
that the original owner of this land

484
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,432
had an interesting story.

485
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:36,735
Well, the original landowner
is a man named John Johnson.

486
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:38,203
And there's his photo.

487
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:41,606
And he settled here originally in 1845.

488
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,242
And here's his house.

489
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:46,044
So, what happens to this guy?

490
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:49,180
He had tragedy after tragedy
for a period of about 15 years.

491
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:51,933
Within hours of arriving on the property,

492
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,035
his father died of pneumonia.

493
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,954
Okay. So his father dies.

494
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:57,555
- Yes.
- What else happened?

495
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:59,057
And then in 1857,

496
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,161
his 5-year-old nephew,
Persis, died of meningitis.

497
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:07,198
And then three months later,
in January of 1858,

498
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,367
his father-in-law, James Taylor, died,

499
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,102
and he lived right next door.

500
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:16,007
1865, one of his other nephews,
James, died of diphtheria.

501
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,542
What a horrible death.

502
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:18,943
- Yeah.
- All right.

503
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,945
So, now he's got all these
family members dying.

504
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,047
Well, that's not all.

505
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,117
On July 9, 1877, it was about 6:00 A.M.,

506
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,853
and his wife called him.

507
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:30,605
See, she was in the house,

508
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,824
and he was out in the barn, doing chores.

509
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:33,992
And so he didn't come,

510
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:36,328
and so she went into the barn to find him,

511
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,096
and that's when she found him

512
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:39,798
actually hanging from the rafters.

513
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:42,117
Why? For what reason?

514
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,402
I don't know.
The family didn't know, either.

515
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:47,005
Okay. So, 1877, he kills himself.

516
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,506
How old is he at this point? He was 61.

517
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:50,508
Now, let me ask you a question.

518
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,243
Are any of them buried on the property?

519
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,112
They're<i> all</i> buried here.

520
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,588
Definitely a broken neck.

521
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,757
Oh, this is bad.

522
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,193
This is not done well.

523
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:14,999
It's a male... old.

524
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,201
Uh...

525
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,903
I'd say he's, like, in his 60s.

526
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,872
He's white.

527
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:23,375
I think... I don't know...
it might have been an accident.

528
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:25,994
An accidental hanging?

529
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:31,015
Um...

530
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:34,152
Because it's so badly done.

531
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:44,062
I saw several entities during my walk,

532
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:47,682
but the group of tricksters
surrounding a living person

533
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,334
had me the most concerned.

534
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:53,905
They were probably about 3 or 4 feet tall.

535
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:58,760
They had large heads, they're pitch-black,

536
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:01,813
and they were all around the bed,
staring at the person.

537
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,752
Is this what you saw?

538
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:09,888
Yes, this is what I saw.

539
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:32,427
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

540
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,062
we're ready to reveal our findings

541
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:37,266
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

542
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,301
Amy, I'd like you to meet Terry,

543
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:40,953
and this is his partner, Bobby.

544
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:46,842
They live here with Terry's
7- year-old grandson, Ashton.

545
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,843
Okay.

546
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:50,312
Now, we've been doing investigations

547
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:52,648
for quite a time now, but these guys have

548
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,716
some of the wildest
stories I've ever heard.

549
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:57,219
They called us in
'cause they can't take it anymore.

550
00:27:57,221 --> 00:27:59,621
It's affecting their relationship,
Terry's health,

551
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:01,890
and, most importantly,
it's affecting Ashton.

552
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:06,995
How long have you lived here?

553
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:08,931
About four years.

554
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:11,433
Four years. When did the activity start?

555
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,168
When we moved in.

556
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:18,440
This was a very unusual walk.

557
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:22,311
I've actually never encountered
anything quite like this.

558
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:25,280
When I went into the house,

559
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:28,584
I actually couldn't trust
anything I was seeing,

560
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:33,305
anything I was hearing,
anything I was feeling.

561
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:37,109
It was insane, really. It was insane.

562
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:41,513
I'm gonna back up, though,

563
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:45,434
and I'm gonna talk about
what I got outside first.

564
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,686
I walked up the driveway,

565
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:53,959
and there was this older man...
probably in his 60s.

566
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:56,678
He was outside,
and he was getting down from something,

567
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,548
and he hung himself.

568
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:06,555
But it was horribly done
and extremely painful.

569
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:11,293
I can't believe she actually
saw something like this,

570
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:12,628
because it didn't happen<i> here.</i>

571
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,164
Their house was actually moved here... Oh.

572
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,799
From about 18 miles away.

573
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:18,967
Okay.

574
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,137
This guy John Johnson lived on the property

575
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,539
that the house came from.

576
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,241
This is the farmland where he lived.

577
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,778
Settled in 1851.

578
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,881
Now, this guy had bad luck
from the minute he got there.

579
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:34,549
His father died of pneumonia

580
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,118
within hours of getting to the property,

581
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,887
and then he lost a nephew,
his father-in-law,

582
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:40,105
then another nephew.

583
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:45,327
So, on July 9, 1877,
he goes out into the barn.

584
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:49,865
His wife goes to find
him, and he's hanging.

585
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,233
He committed suicide.

586
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,871
So, the guy you saw,
you said, was in his 60s.

587
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,973
This guy Johnson died at the age of 61.

588
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:02,077
Now, I was able to locate a photo of him.

589
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,716
Oh, my.

590
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:13,555
What's the matter?

591
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,590
I've seen him.

592
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:19,394
That's the old man from the hallway.

593
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:22,998
I was in my house one day,

594
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,201
and I just happened to
glance up in the mirror,

595
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,436
and behind me...

596
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:31,606
It looked just like him.

597
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:34,910
And it looked like he was coming after me.

598
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:37,946
I ran down the hallway and
slammed the door behind me,

599
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,314
it scared me so bad.

600
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,718
Does this guy look familiar to you at all?

601
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,187
Oh, yeah.

602
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:46,488
I'm a little creeped out

603
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,857
knowing that he came from another property.

604
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,094
I didn't even think anything
like that could be possible.

605
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,261
Yes, it is.

606
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:56,631
The dead can form all sorts of attachments.

607
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:57,899
Wow.

608
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,073
When I went into the house,

609
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:08,944
the first thing that I
saw was this living male.

610
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:14,116
And he seemed very angry and upset,

611
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:18,887
and he was kind of yelling and screaming,
very emotional,

612
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:24,192
and I saw that he had brown
hair and he was in his 40s.

613
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,029
It's me.

614
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:34,169
Yeah, I'm kind of confrontational
with the ghosts.

615
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:37,773
When I can't get any sleep,
I get up and I yell at them.

616
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:40,208
Okay.

617
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,446
The other thing that I got...

618
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:51,486
There is somebody at the
location with abilities.

619
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:56,091
And their dominant ability is telepathy.

620
00:31:57,394 --> 00:32:01,663
The telepath can manipulate
the minds of those around them

621
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:05,700
into perceiving what they're perceiving.

622
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,804
So,
there's only two guys living in this place.

623
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,388
Which one of these two is the telepath?

624
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,378
Well, right away, when I sat down...

625
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,248
and you know I did not know their names...

626
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,300
I wrote this down. Oh, geez. Look at that.

627
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:23,251
Yeah.

628
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:24,786
She put your first initial down.

629
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,626
Wow.

630
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:36,448
I've always kind of felt
like maybe I was sensitive

631
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,600
or had some weird type of power.

632
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:42,370
I would say my moods are contagious.

633
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:46,541
Sure explains a lot, don't it?

634
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:50,445
It makes sense.

635
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:57,752
We also have these other
things that are here,

636
00:32:57,754 --> 00:33:01,923
and what I'll call them is the tricksters.

637
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,877
Typically, a trickster is associated

638
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,396
with Native American tribes,
but they're all over the world.

639
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:10,699
But that's not what's going on here.

640
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,901
This is where it gets very unusual.

641
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,370
There's about 50 of them.

642
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,844
These guys are causing all kinds of chaos.

643
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:26,982
They like to feed off of
negative environments.

644
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:31,086
They're about like 3 or 4 feet tall,

645
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:33,922
shiny... very shiny... black,
like, glistening.

646
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:37,158
Well, they've seen them.

647
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,061
One of the many things that
these guys experience here.

648
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:40,896
Yeah.

649
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,966
I had an experience...

650
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:47,369
three of them at the foot of my bed.

651
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:48,503
Oh, yes.

652
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:50,755
I jumped out of the bed,
I ran through them,

653
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:52,741
and got out into the hallway.

654
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:56,778
I am awakened every night by these things.

655
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,680
Wow. Okay.

656
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:02,984
The thing about the bed is,
when I was in that middle room,

657
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:05,554
I actually did see them getting
and having a good time...

658
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:07,472
That's where I always see them.

659
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:10,508
And jumping on the bed,
and they were having a blast.

660
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:15,363
Here, they're more aggressive.

661
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:17,499
They're, like, jumping on the bed

662
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:20,151
like they're having a good time,

663
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,370
barking and growling.

664
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,808
And that's where Ashton sleeps.

665
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:30,946
One night, I heard him scream
in the middle of the night,

666
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:32,581
and he came running out, and he swore

667
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:35,116
there was red eyes in the
closet staring right at him,

668
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:36,868
that they were coming at him.

669
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,655
He's scared to death.

670
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:44,776
These things can manipulate what you see,

671
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:48,897
and, you know, most often,

672
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,767
they'll actually appear as
animals and things like that.

673
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,769
Tell her.

674
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,672
I was laying in bed one night,

675
00:34:57,674 --> 00:35:00,258
and I saw a little fawn
actually hop through the window,

676
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,977
and it hopped in front of the bed

677
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,979
and then just booked it down the hallway.

678
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:05,447
Okay.

679
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,149
It's really bad.

680
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,793
The other thing was,

681
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:24,532
these guys are going to draw
from you any kind of negativity

682
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,419
because that's gonna feed them,

683
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:31,673
so these things will bring up
these done and over issues,

684
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,842
like past traumas

685
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:36,111
or bad things that have
happened in a person's life.

686
00:35:36,113 --> 00:35:38,029
They'll, like, trigger that,

687
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,281
and then you're thinking
about it and thinking about it

688
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:41,750
and talking about it and talking about it,

689
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,568
and it's just feeding it and feeding it.

690
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,953
Do you know what I'm saying?

691
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:50,492
I think
about that all the time.

692
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:54,346
I don't tell anybody that.

693
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,204
It just makes you feel like no
matter how much good you do,

694
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,489
you'll never make up

695
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:07,475
for every bad thing you've
ever done in your life.

696
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:13,865
But when I'm <i>not</i> here,
I never think it.

697
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:18,787
Sometimes I stay long at
school so I don't have to.

698
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,391
He thinks I don't want to come home.

699
00:36:23,393 --> 00:36:25,126
I don't want to...

700
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:28,096
I want something to think
about that's different.

701
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,167
I told <i>nobody</i> about that.

702
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,588
I'm sorry.

703
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,111
So, everything she's saying

704
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,613
is making sense to both of you guys?

705
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:50,051
So, I did have a sketch done

706
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:52,454
of what I saw in the master bedroom.

707
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:59,060
Ooh.

708
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:12,540
Oh, my God.

709
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:28,258
So, I did have a sketch done

710
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,861
of what I saw in the master bedroom.

711
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,599
Ooh.

712
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:46,059
Oh, my God.

713
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,804
And this <i>is</i> where I see them,

714
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,756
is around the bottom corner of my bed.

715
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:02,626
No wonder I'm not getting any sleep.

716
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:05,112
Are they, like, physically capable

717
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:07,014
of pulling the covers off of me?

718
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:07,865
Yes.

719
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,634
Oh, no.

720
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:14,104
These tricksters have a leader.

721
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:17,274
I saw him outside.

722
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:20,911
When he was alive,
he was a very strong, powerful man,

723
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:26,450
and he did have a lot of
power placed upon him.

724
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,653
He was in charge of a lot of people.

725
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:33,223
He was from probably, I think,
about 80 to 100 years ago.

726
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:37,327
He was extremely pissed
off about the way he died

727
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,596
because he didn't want to die that way.

728
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,565
He should have died, like,
in a blaze of glory.

729
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,066
Okay, so, this guy was powerful

730
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,868
and was in charge of a lot of people?

731
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,370
Yes.

732
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:48,639
So, the original owner of
the property you're on now

733
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,440
was this guy Alva Shaw.

734
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,692
He was very well-connected.

735
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:53,694
Matter of fact, he was so well-connected,

736
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,813
he was appointed by the governor in 1864

737
00:38:56,815 --> 00:39:00,317
to be the superintendent of the
state penitentiary in Portland.

738
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:02,085
Problem was, he wasn't good at it.

739
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,670
When he was running the penitentiary,

740
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:04,688
44 prisoners escaped.

741
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,858
Only 13 were ever recaptured.

742
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,828
So, on August 27, 1866,

743
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,463
eight prisoners take him hostage.

744
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:17,100
He was able to break away,
but a bunch of them escaped.

745
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,602
Only five were recaptured.

746
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:19,970
The next morning,

747
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:22,573
he wakes up to an editorial
calling him a disgrace

748
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:25,042
and that he doesn't know
how to run a prison

749
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:28,562
and he caused this whole thing to happen.

750
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:33,016
Now, this is him at a younger age.

751
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,052
Now, he died in 1880 at the age of 64

752
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:37,554
after a 13-hour illness.

753
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:38,789
He just died.

754
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,275
So, he didn't definitely
go out in a blaze of glory.

755
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:42,426
That's for sure.

756
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:44,428
I don't know if this is the person or not.

757
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,963
I really don't.

758
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,067
This is so overwhelming.

759
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:52,469
I never expected this much.

760
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:55,539
I mean, I knew there was a lot going on,
but wow.

761
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:04,146
So, guys, you know why
you've been fighting.

762
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,682
You know why your moods have been changing.

763
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:09,018
You know why you're
hearing and seeing things.

764
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,486
But the big question is,

765
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:13,189
are you gonna be able to raise
Ashton here in a safe place?

766
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,758
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

767
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:21,397
A lot of things have to be
attacked at the same time

768
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:24,000
to get a good, good result.

769
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:26,736
So, the first thing is the dead guy,
the leader...

770
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,938
He needs to go.

771
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,774
So, what I would like
to see happen with him

772
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:35,228
is a physical medium to come in,
talk to him,

773
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,980
and get him to leave.

774
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:39,816
But, at the same time,

775
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:42,986
you also need to have a shaman come in,

776
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:46,055
and what I want that person to do

777
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:48,925
is to set up a perimeter
around your property,

778
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:50,593
and I mean big.

779
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:52,962
Like, all the way around, okay?

780
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:56,215
This is gonna push these tricksters out.

781
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:58,468
So, once that's done,

782
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,737
you have to deal with your abilities.

783
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:02,722
Start keeping a daily journal.

784
00:41:02,724 --> 00:41:06,175
And what I want you to do is
to write up any and all issues

785
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,645
that create strong emotions within you.

786
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:10,546
Once a week,
I want you to take all those pages

787
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,715
that you've written all this stuff in

788
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:16,019
and burn it and just get rid of that.

789
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,655
Put it away and out from you.

790
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,191
Now, I spoke to Ashton. He's 7 years old.

791
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:24,227
He really doesn't understand
what's going on here,

792
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:25,561
but he's scared.

793
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:27,730
How long do you think before
he'll maybe feel better

794
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:28,798
about things in the house?

795
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,352
He'll feel a lot better

796
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:35,722
once the shaman's moved
all of the tricksters

797
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,106
off the property.

798
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,910
So, are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

799
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,545
Every step of the way.

800
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:43,963
We're gonna get it taken care of.

801
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,214
I want them out of my house.

802
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,549
Now it's payback.

803
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,852
They're gonna pay.

804
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:51,287
They're gonna go.

805
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,425
I really hope Terry
and Bobby follow my advice

806
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:59,762
and deal with the tricksters
terrorizing their family.

807
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,631
With the help of a medium and a shaman,

808
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,900
they should be able to
free themselves of the evil

809
00:42:03,902 --> 00:42:05,568
surrounding their home.
