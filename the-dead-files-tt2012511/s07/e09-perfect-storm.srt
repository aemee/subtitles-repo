1
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,326
Then the house spit out this entity.

2
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,999
There was a silhouette, just all black,

3
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,869
- standing in the doorway.
- Ow.

4
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:23,539
Her face had been bludgeoned
till she was unrecognizable.

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,643
This thing does not
[bleep] like this person.

6
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,246
I need to know that my family is safe.

7
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:33,382
This person's in trouble.

8
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:37,754
It's saying, "I'm gonna make you pay."

9
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:40,423
Something bad's going to happen.

10
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:43,326
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:44,694
There's panic.

12
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,129
And it's almost like a butchering.

13
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:47,196
I see dead people.

14
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:49,332
They all died horribly.

15
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,033
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,435
Get out of here.

17
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,070
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:56,105
Vicious.

19
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:59,242
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,943
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

21
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,512
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:04,147
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,048
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,750
This guy's a real piece of work.

25
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:11,420
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:12,922
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

27
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:14,090
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:16,359
This is not good.

29
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,094
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,129
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,898
Until the very end...

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,366
I want my life back.

33
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:25,568
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,370
Is he trying to kill her?

35
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:28,638
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,139
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,641
This is going to kill us.

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,242
I'm in Delaware, Ohio,
about 35 minutes north of Columbus.

39
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:51,611
I got a call from a newlywed mother of two

40
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,996
who just moved into her new husband's home.

41
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,965
You would think this would be
the happiest time of her life,

42
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,301
but she says she's in a living hell.

43
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:00,319
She's convinced the house is haunted

44
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,072
and that her and her two
kids are in serious danger.

45
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,308
She practically begged me
and Amy to come out here,

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,176
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

47
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:12,515
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:16,118
I clear the house of
any leading information.

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,687
Once family photos,

50
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,157
religious and personal items
are covered or removed,

51
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,492
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:36,339
I'm having problems with this lady

53
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:41,844
'cause she feels like it's
hell for her to be here.

54
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:44,814
But I think she had money and nice things,

55
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,584
but her husband made
them move here to farm,

56
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,887
and things did not go well.

57
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,323
She thought that the land was bad.

58
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:59,245
Then, she says she is gonna give
him a taste of his own medicine.

59
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,206
Amy, you sounded
really bad on the phone

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,008
as far as the activity here.

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,409
What's happening?

62
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,811
Well, I moved here about four months ago,

63
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:19,048
with my two children, after I got married.

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,751
And it's escalated to the
point where it's pure hell

65
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,336
living here.

66
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:28,391
It's just not what I expected
from being newly married.

67
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,725
Did you guys buy this place together?

68
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:30,993
- What happened?
- We did not.

69
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,095
Phil actually purchased this house,
um, a few months

70
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,564
before we met a couple years ago.

71
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:38,217
Okay. So, who exactly lives in the house?

72
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,885
I have a picture here.

73
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,606
Um, this is my husband, Phil, and myself.

74
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,508
There is my older child, Jerrick.

75
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,943
He's 15.

76
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:50,663
My younger child, Matthias,
who is on the autism spectrum,

77
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,214
he is 10. So, Amy,

78
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,250
what kind of things are you
guys experiencing in the house?

79
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:58,020
We have, um, heard things.

80
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:01,824
Doors will open and close on their own.

81
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:05,328
We have seen shadows and apparitions.

82
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,530
And it's even escalated to the point

83
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:09,515
where people have been touched.

84
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,534
I need to know that my family is safe,

85
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,320
and I'm not sure that's the case right now.

86
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,755
Is everybody in the house

87
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,057
having the same amount of experiences?

88
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:21,744
I personally feel like I
have a lot of experiences.

89
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,145
My older son, Jerrick,

90
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:27,350
has had quite a bit of the
bulk of experiences, as well.

91
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,402
Okay. How's he handling all this?

92
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,553
Not very well.

93
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:32,571
He's... He's incredibly frustrated.

94
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,241
Um, at times, he gets angry.

95
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:36,442
Wants it to stop,

96
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,728
and, quite frankly, if it doesn't stop,

97
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,314
- he doesn't want to live here.
- Really?

98
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,698
I have, at times,

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,053
shouted at whatever this
is in a very loud voice.

100
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:49,839
I've just told it that my God
is a lot stronger than you.

101
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,841
Did it stop for a little bit?

102
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,793
I think I made it more angry.

103
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,761
I feel like it's evil

104
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:59,081
and definitely does not
want me and my kids here.

105
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,654
This woman is complaining
about her mother-in-law.

106
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:13,062
So, this older woman,
she hates the daughter-in-law.

107
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,797
She didn't take care of her family.

108
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,433
She didn't take pride in the family.

109
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:22,438
What I'm seeing, um,
in these rooms and stuff... mm...

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
doesn't look like this place.

111
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:28,778
- Okay.
- Um, she's freaking out now.

112
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,379
It's like she's all hyper now.

113
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,248
It's making me anxious.

114
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,349
Oh!

115
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,419
I saw her looking like a corpse.

116
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,595
This is a really,
really creepy place down here.

117
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,763
I don't like to come down here.

118
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,698
- Neither does anyone else.
- Okay.

119
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,450
So, why are you creeped out by it?

120
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,869
You constantly feel like
you're being watched.

121
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,254
So, right now, you have that feeling?

122
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,891
- Yes.
- Anything else?

123
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,093
Well, the... the most terrifying experience

124
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:06,732
was when I was pushed down
the stairs quite forcefully.

125
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,318
Okay. So, how hard did you get pushed?

126
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,986
Pretty hard, because, I mean, it sent me...

127
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,288
Here. Just hit me.

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,372
No, no. Just hit my chest.

129
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,707
Show me. Like that.

130
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,075
With both hands, or was it just one?

131
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,610
Yeah. I mean, it was forceful enough

132
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,062
to send me flying down into the wall.

133
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:21,530
- I'm scared now...
- Yeah.

134
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,499
'Cause I don't know if
it's gonna happen again.

135
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,039
There are two people running down there,

136
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,341
and they're yelling, and they're scared.

137
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:37,346
Yeah, they're all...
bunch of people cowering in the corner.

138
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,085
How many?

139
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,520
10 to 15.

140
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:48,991
They're all balled up,
hunched down, and like that.

141
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:54,280
I think that people would
feel uncomfortable here.

142
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:58,801
They would feel, uh, fear, uh,

143
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,669
but it's from these people.

144
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:11,747
Okay. So, what's going on in here?

145
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:18,037
I have seen a shadow figure
standing right beside of my bed,

146
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,421
looking down at me.

147
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:20,506
He was tall.

148
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,791
I'm gonna guess close to 6'.

149
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,577
Couldn't give you distinct facial features

150
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,879
other than he was very thin.

151
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,297
Was it dark in the room?

152
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:31,851
There was just enough light that...
that you could see.

153
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,435
Did you sleep the rest of the night?

154
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,937
Off and on.

155
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,307
I didn't sleep very well,
and I haven't really ever since.

156
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:44,246
What the [bleep]

157
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,248
I don't like it up here.

158
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,884
I don't feel good up here.

159
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,520
Something runs around...

160
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:55,958
something dark, fast.

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,994
Something's dripping off of it.

162
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,363
- Can people see it, too?
- Oh, yeah.

163
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:05,267
This is the thing that
they're encountering big-time.

164
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,635
They can't sleep.

165
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:10,306
They're having, like,
apparently out-of-body experiences.

166
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:16,912
It's making me nervous and panicky,

167
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,816
and it touches people.

168
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,419
They, uh... They can feel it.

169
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,404
It gives you, like, the chills.

170
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,727
Now, has anything else
happened to you up here?

171
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,164
Yes. In my office next door,

172
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,600
- I was typing at my computer.
- Okay.

173
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:41,370
And the next minute,
I was on the floor screaming,

174
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:45,774
and my son had called
911 because I had fallen.

175
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:50,079
The chair landed on top of me,
and I was unconscious briefly.

176
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:51,547
What the hell happened?

177
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:55,317
It's almost as if my chair was
flipped over with me in it,

178
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,354
is... is kind of how it looked and felt.

179
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:00,606
Have you ever experienced
fainting spells in the past?

180
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,690
Yes.

181
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,609
But you don't think this is that?

182
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,177
You think it's paranormal?

183
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,063
I do think it's paranormal.

184
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,064
I had no warning.

185
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,183
I didn't feel weird that day.

186
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,603
Everything was fine,
and it was with enough force

187
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,440
that I landed across the room
with my head into the wall.

188
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,858
I don't know that I'm so convinced

189
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,611
that that's paranormal,
but I think we'll figure it out.

190
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,213
Okay.

191
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,848
Have you thought about leaving?

192
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,950
If they're in danger... I mean,

193
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:29,618
I would move tonight if...

194
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,954
if I thought my kids were not safe.

195
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,863
This thing is here most
of the time in this room.

196
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:43,866
This woman with, like, light hair...

197
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,467
Like, is she being grabbed?

198
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,102
She can feel it.

199
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:52,374
Being grabbed in the
back of the neck, hard.

200
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,076
Like, I feel her neck hurts.

201
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,179
Like, her spine in her neck, you know?

202
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:02,418
Then, it, like, slams her forward

203
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,485
so she's, like, sitting,

204
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,254
and it just goes...

205
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,156
Like, all of a sudden, she's just like...

206
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:11,910
Oh, my God.

207
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:13,929
Ah.

208
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,313
Now, Phil, when I talked to Amy,

209
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,515
she was talking about
how you bought this place

210
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,916
before you guys even met.

211
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,301
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

212
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,919
So, how long were you here
before she actually moved in?

213
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,287
About 21/2 years.

214
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,790
So, did you notice anything
unusual when you first moved in?

215
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:52,328
Honestly, I never really saw
much in those 21/2 years.

216
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,232
After Amy and the kids moved in, um, I...

217
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,901
it just... Things escalated from there.

218
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,537
- What happened?
- One night, I was sleeping.

219
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,374
And around 3:30 in the morning,
I just was restless.

220
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:08,244
And I kind of rolled over
and looked over my shoulder,

221
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:11,564
and in the doorway was a...

222
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:13,933
like, a silhouette, just all black,

223
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:15,618
standing in the doorway.

224
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,454
I stared at it for about five seconds.

225
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:19,521
The eyes were clear.

226
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:21,290
Everything else was black.

227
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,825
And, after five seconds,

228
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,810
I looked away, looked
back, and it was gone.

229
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,963
- That's when I was convinced.
- Okay.

230
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:30,499
So, have you experienced anything else?

231
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,934
Doors opening and closing.

232
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,369
I'd be downstairs,

233
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,388
and you would hear one of the
bedroom door's latch click.

234
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,756
And then, it would pause for a second.

235
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:38,874
Then, you'd hear it closed again.

236
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,743
And you can go up and press the doors,

237
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,544
and they're locked.

238
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:43,879
So, you've gone up to investigate?

239
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,147
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

240
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,515
Are you sure the kids ain't up there?

241
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:47,983
Positive.

242
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,351
Amy's gonna do her walk,

243
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,170
and she may say, "Listen,
you need to move from here."

244
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,755
How... How would you feel about that?

245
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:53,872
- I love the house.
- Right.

246
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:58,627
But I love my wife and kids a lot more.

247
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:03,132
This thing causes a lot of anxiety.

248
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,534
It's almost like, if the doors were closed,
this thing would,

249
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:08,971
like, run back and forth and,
like, slam into the door,

250
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,272
trying to get in.

251
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,060
They hear it.

252
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,529
It, like...

253
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:21,717
can go into people's bodies a little bit,

254
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:25,220
and it definitely takes
energy away from people.

255
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:27,439
And then, it... it makes them do things.

256
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,958
Like what?

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,127
Picks people for the
person to get angry at.

258
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,930
So it's not, like, a generalized anger.

259
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,598
It's specific.

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,852
Like, it plants very specific thoughts.

261
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:44,290
Like, "You're gonna get
angry at<i> this</i> person."

262
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:48,644
Somehow, it's associated with the house.

263
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:54,516
I see it, like, pulling things
from the past and eating it.

264
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:03,892
Jerrick, how old are you?

265
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:06,095
15.

266
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,830
So, I was talking to Mom and Phil.

267
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:09,465
Seems like things are pretty bad here.

268
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,850
Yeah, our attitudes change a lot.

269
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:15,604
I'll be just sitting down,
just having a great day.

270
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:18,240
And then, out of nowhere,
I'll just be angry

271
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,159
and just get angry at
the world for no reason.

272
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:22,745
And it's just... It's really weird.

273
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,163
Anything else?

274
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,348
I'm a firm believer that
there's three shadow figures

275
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,133
in this house... a taller one,

276
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:32,388
big, black, probably about
5'10" to, like, 6' tall,

277
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,923
and two shorter ones, more childlike.

278
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,108
Where do you see that?

279
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,693
You'll see it out of the
corner of your eye.

280
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:39,078
You'll see something,

281
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,731
like, smaller peeking around
the corner of the stairs at you.

282
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,466
I mean, how are you dealing with this?

283
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:45,868
I don't sleep well.

284
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,970
If something happens,
I'll either ignore it or...

285
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,805
I'm not usually really
quick to challenge it

286
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,223
because I don't like challenging things

287
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,474
that I can't fight back to,

288
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,777
- 'cause I can't see them.
- Anything else?

289
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,379
One time, I was sitting up in my room,
watching TV,

290
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,480
and something came over

291
00:13:58,482 --> 00:13:59,832
and just slammed its hand down on my leg,

292
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,950
with more force than that.

293
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,118
What do you think is here?

294
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,537
I feel that whatever's in this house

295
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,258
doesn't really like people
who are devout Christians.

296
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:15,697
Whoo!

297
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:19,034
This thing does not
[bleep] like this person

298
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:22,271
and, like, is, like, choking them bad.

299
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,807
Like, holy [bleep]

300
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,977
Like, cannot breathe.

301
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:32,598
This is very focused, which is strange

302
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,317
because this thing doesn't
have one consciousness.

303
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,587
This person is somehow triggering something

304
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:39,955
in this thing

305
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:43,725
that's making it want to
kill this [bleep] person.

306
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,530
- So it could?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:48,532 --> 00:14:53,602
I- I don't know how that hasn't happened.

308
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:55,704
Ooh, it's so bad.

309
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,773
This person's in trouble.

310
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,645
Phil and Amy don't have
a clue about the history

311
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,214
of their property,

312
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:21,033
so I reached out to
several local historians.

313
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,436
I just got a call back from a genealogist.

314
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:27,022
He tells me the original owners
of their land ended up broke,

315
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,891
alone, and insane.

316
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:35,798
Russ, you mentioned on the phone

317
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,501
that the original owners
of my clients' land

318
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,002
had a pretty tough time there

319
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,370
and that they actually went insane.

320
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,389
- Is that right?
- Yes, they did.

321
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:44,740
There were two gentlemen.

322
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,309
There was a prominent Pittsburgh
judge named Henry Baldwin.

323
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,311
And I have a picture of Baldwin here.

324
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:52,047
He inherited the property,
about 16,000 acres...

325
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,849
- Okay...
- in about 1807,

326
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,551
but he didn't want to come to Delaware.

327
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:58,671
So he hired Moses Bixby
to manage the property.

328
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:01,207
He was a local businessman
in the Delaware area.

329
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,226
A year later,
Henry Baldwin sold Bixby the land.

330
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:05,428
How does it go for him?

331
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,097
In 1816, his daughter Lucy

332
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,599
dies of unknown causes at the age of 27.

333
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,369
1821, his wife, also named Lucy...

334
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,005
She dies at the age of 61.

335
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,173
Okay.

336
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:19,241
So Bixby suffered a lot
during his time there.

337
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:21,811
But you said the two
original owners went insane.

338
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,196
Who went crazy first... Bixby or Baldwin?

339
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,648
Baldwin.

340
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,967
Actually,
he was appointed to Congress in 1822.

341
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,635
Shortly after taking his seat,

342
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:32,354
he steps down because of mental illness.

343
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,173
He ends up coming back to Delaware,

344
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,258
and he's wanting his property back.

345
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,461
The property that he sold to Bixby?

346
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,462
- Correct, yes.
- All right.

347
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,513
So, what does he do?

348
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,097
He ends up taking Bixby to court.

349
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,933
Bixby does win the case

350
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:47,586
because Baldwin did sell him the property.

351
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:51,574
Even though Bixby won the case,
it took a big toll on him.

352
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:55,344
Later on that year, he is declared insane,

353
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:58,214
and the state legislature
appoints guardians to keep him.

354
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:01,784
Here's an article to that effect.

355
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,286
Okay. So now, he's being watched
by these state guardians.

356
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:06,272
- How does it go?
- It doesn't go well.

357
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:10,109
Two years later, in 1826,
Bixby escapes the house

358
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,194
and runs into the Olentangy River,

359
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,213
and he dies a few days later of pneumonia.

360
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:15,998
And here's his obit.

361
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,603
All right. So, we see
how it ends for Bixby.

362
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,971
What about Baldwin?

363
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,606
It doesn't go well for him either.

364
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,608
He ends up dying penniless and alone

365
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,510
in a hotel in Philadelphia.

366
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:37,820
I think this thing makes people act funny.

367
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:40,523
So, what is this thing exactly?

368
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,791
It's from the house.

369
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:46,462
Over time, the house collected
all of these energies

370
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,113
from people.

371
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,532
Maybe the land was bad.

372
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,400
And then, this, you know,

373
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:55,304
collected that negative
energy from living people.

374
00:17:55,306 --> 00:18:00,042
And then, the house, like,
spit out this, like, entity.

375
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,213
Like, almost like PK?

376
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,081
Something like that.

377
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,352
PK or entities created by
psychokinesis are very powerful

378
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:12,821
and can physically
influence their environment.

379
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,523
What's freaking me out about this one

380
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:17,776
is that it was created by the
house instead of a person,

381
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:21,530
and that's something
I've never seen before.

382
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:24,300
It's definitely getting stronger, um,

383
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,402
so that makes me concerned.

384
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,106
So far, I've got clients

385
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,809
that have been physically
assaulted by unseen forces

386
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,512
and two former property
owners who went insane.

387
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,180
But I've still got to see
if there's anything else

388
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:41,016
that could help my case.

389
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:43,218
Searching through old records,
I find a woman

390
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,056
who killed her husband
during a forced baptism

391
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,991
right next to Amy and Phil's property.

392
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,096
Heading over to meet with a local pastor

393
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,131
who agreed to look into this case for me.

394
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,106
Jason, thanks for meeting me.

395
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,574
I appreciate it. In all my time

396
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,376
on the police department
and working homicides,

397
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:12,498
I never had a case involving
a murder with baptism.

398
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,083
And the reason I'm interested in his death

399
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,251
is because it happened right
near my client's property.

400
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,020
So, what do you know about this guy?

401
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,371
William McCoy.

402
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,825
He joined the National Guard
right before World War I,

403
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,126
so it'd be 1917.

404
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,629
He ended up going to Europe and serving.

405
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,130
And while he was there,

406
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,248
his battalion,

407
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,868
or his squad,
got bombed by the Germans with gas.

408
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,537
And he ended up having to come back.

409
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,456
He was honorably discharged,

410
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,309
and because of the damage to his lungs,

411
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,244
tuberculosis sets in.

412
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:43,545
Okay. So, what happens?

413
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:46,799
He ends up actually meeting a lady,
Bertha Wilson.

414
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,417
This is Bertha.

415
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,021
And I guess they fell in love,
and they get married.

416
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:56,592
By 1925, McCoy's lungs
have deteriorated so badly

417
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:59,294
that he's being treated at
this hospital in Dayton,

418
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,930
and they basically send him home to die.

419
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,399
Okay.

420
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,369
And they send him, basically,
to his foster parents' house

421
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,737
here in Delaware.

422
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:13,242
They called in a local Grace
Methodist Episcopal pastor

423
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,678
to baptize him,

424
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,180
but he does it by pouring or sprinkling.

425
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,916
Bertha demands a different type of baptism.

426
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,217
The only way in her eyes

427
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:25,554
that he could truly know that
his soul was gonna be saved

428
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:28,991
is if he was immersed in full baptism.

429
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,926
She calls in this Reverend Pennell.

430
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,145
They pull him off of his deathbed

431
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,964
and immerse him in the water.

432
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:39,001
He died very soon after the immersion.

433
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,035
Okay.

434
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:43,372
This is his death certificate.

435
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,724
Now, was she ever officially charged?

436
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:46,725
No.

437
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,610
There's never charges filed.

438
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,879
Mainly, the sheriff and so forth said,

439
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,849
"Hey, he was gonna die in hours,

440
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,350
or days at the most."

441
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:59,088
Now, how did this sit
with the foster parents?

442
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,457
Well, I mean, they were opposed to it.

443
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,841
They were opposed to the immersion.

444
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,960
They... They didn't want that to happen.

445
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,949
I'm seeing the angry young woman again.

446
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:16,455
She told me it was 1910, 1915, and 1925...

447
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:20,509
were very important years for her.

448
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:25,631
She and the mother-in-law... You know,
they had issues.

449
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,316
They butted heads.

450
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,768
The daughter-in-law didn't
want to be here anymore,

451
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,821
and she didn't want to live that life.

452
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:37,059
I think she did, you know,
some pretty bad stuff.

453
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:40,763
She's blaming the land for her actions

454
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,365
and how she became.

455
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:48,654
Maybe that the land brings
out the worst in people

456
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:52,224
is kind of, I think,
what she's trying to say.

457
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,359
So, yeah, I think it's her husband,
and I think...

458
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,394
I think she killed him.

459
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:15,156
I never know how wide Amy will open,

460
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:18,893
so I look into the property and
the surrounding neighborhood.

461
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:21,596
Now, during my research,
one thing caught my eye...

462
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:24,365
a teenage kid who brutally
murdered his girlfriend

463
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:27,451
right near Amy and Phil's property.

464
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm heading over to meet with
a Delaware police captain

465
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:31,939
who said that killer is now a free man.

466
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,318
So, Captain, the reason
I asked you to help me out is,

467
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,954
I found that article about
a homicide back in '53.

468
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:48,589
Involved a young girl, uh,

469
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,857
who was murdered less than a mile

470
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:51,192
from my clients' property.

471
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,744
What do you know about the
victim in the case itself?

472
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:57,265
Well, she was a former
Ohio Wesleyan student.

473
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:59,300
Her name was Cynthia Pfeil,

474
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:02,370
and she was 18 years old.

475
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,071
Okay.

476
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:06,307
The gentleman that
murdered her and was convicted

477
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:11,679
of her murder was a gentleman
by the name of Roy Schinagle.

478
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,381
What was their relationship?

479
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:18,019
They had, uh,
dated for approximately two years.

480
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,670
So, how does the murder take place?

481
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,389
- What happens?
- Well, what we know is,

482
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:24,308
on September 16, 1953,

483
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,195
Cynthia's lifeless body was found along
"a lonely road,"

484
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,248
I believe, is the way it was referred to.

485
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,616
Okay.

486
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,336
Her body showed that she had
been strangled or choked.

487
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:37,972
Her face had been
bludgeoned to such an extent

488
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:41,375
that she was unrecognizable.

489
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:43,511
Wow.

490
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:46,047
He, uh, confessed to the crime,

491
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,916
that he had choked her
and also bludgeoned her.

492
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:51,736
So, was she choked to death,
and then he beats her?

493
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:53,588
I mean, do we have any idea what happened?

494
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,690
We really don't know for sure,

495
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:56,857
but it's been surmised

496
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:00,411
that he possibly bludgeoned
her at that point

497
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,763
to prevent her from being recognized.

498
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:04,632
And we don't know what the motive was?

499
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:05,766
Right.

500
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:08,686
It was reported that Roy
and her had an argument.

501
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:09,870
I believe he's quoted

502
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,206
as referring to it as a
"silly little thing"

503
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,507
they argued over.

504
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:14,675
All right. So, now, what happens?

505
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:16,811
He gives the confession.

506
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:18,980
He was indicted for a
first-degree murder trial

507
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:20,948
and found guilty of second-degree murder

508
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,085
on October 24, 1953.

509
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,420
He served 10 years and was paroled.

510
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:29,607
That's extraordinary
how quick that happened.

511
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,691
Yes.

512
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,693
Mr. Schinagle is... is alive.

513
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,362
He's 81 years old,

514
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:38,916
and he's still living somewhere in...
in the state.

515
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,642
Something happened.

516
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,945
Um... I don't know.

517
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:57,518
I just see some chick getting beat up.

518
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,353
Mm.

519
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,422
She's just getting hit in the head.

520
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:05,042
The brunette...
The brunette gets knocked down.

521
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:06,627
She blacked out.

522
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,163
Doesn't even know what
[bleep] hit her, you know?

523
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,665
But, like, there's a male.

524
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,566
She knows this guy. She knows this guy.

525
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:15,169
I don't know how old they are.

526
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,170
I don't know.

527
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,040
Probably between [bleep]

528
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:21,275
I don't know, 17 to 20s.

529
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:23,611
- I don't know.
- Okay.

530
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:26,931
Feeling choked.

531
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,683
Like, pressure on my neck.

532
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:37,191
I hear a male voice saying,

533
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:41,896
"I'm gonna make you pay."

534
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,868
And then, I hear "[bleep]"

535
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,637
Oh, my God.

536
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:00,498
During my walk,

537
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,918
I saw a dead young woman
who was extremely angry.

538
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,419
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

539
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:09,040
to describe how she appeared in life.

540
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:13,310
She's probably about 17 years old.

541
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:16,247
Her eyes are deep-set,

542
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:20,735
and she has pretty thick eyebrows.

543
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,003
Next, I described a living person

544
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:26,006
being attacked by this thing.

545
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:30,077
It looks like it came out of a swamp.

546
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,616
It was, like,
putting its hand over the person's face.

547
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:38,786
And it was putting the other hand,
like, here.

548
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:46,694
Is this what you saw?

549
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,900
Yes, that's what I saw.

550
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:16,352
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

551
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,653
we're ready to reveal our findings

552
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:21,491
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

553
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:24,694
Amy, I want you to meet Phil and Amy.

554
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:26,846
They're newlyweds,
but their life's been anything

555
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,264
but a honeymoon.

556
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,666
Now, Amy moved in here
about four months ago

557
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:31,934
with her two kids.

558
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:34,871
And this is a photo of
the whole family here.

559
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:37,707
- This is Jerrick, who's 15...
- Oh. Okay.

560
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,792
And Matthias, who is 10.

561
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:42,979
The weird thing is that until
Amy moved in here with the kids,

562
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:44,947
the place was relatively quiet.

563
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,233
And then, all hell broke loose.

564
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,785
Amy's very religious,

565
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:52,288
and her priorities in
life are God and her kids,

566
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,956
but she doesn't think
either one of those things

567
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,958
are welcome here.

568
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,761
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about your family dynamics,

569
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:00,730
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

570
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:04,934
So, the first person that I met

571
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,869
was a female who was telling me

572
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:12,191
how she felt like this was
hell for her to be here.

573
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:14,677
She looked nice.

574
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,899
A very well-dressed, uh,
attractive woman, young.

575
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:23,986
Her husband made her come here,

576
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,773
and it was all, like, dirt.

577
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:32,361
Her mother-in-law was here,
and they did not get along.

578
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:34,030
The younger lady

579
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:38,534
was talking about how she was really pissed

580
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:40,420
that her husband brought her here,

581
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:43,072
that she couldn't be fancy anymore.

582
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:45,775
And then, she was saying how she was gonna,

583
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:48,945
uh, give him a taste of his own medicine.

584
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:55,418
I kind of thought that
maybe she killed him.

585
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,653
She gave me three very specific years...

586
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:01,224
1910, 1915, and 1925.

587
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:05,561
She said that these were
very important years for her.

588
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:08,097
I got an idea who you
might be talking about.

589
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,367
Now, you said the young woman
mentioned 1910, 1915, 1925.

590
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:15,188
Yes. Well,
I don't know anything about 1910 or 1915,

591
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,541
but 1925 is definitely significant.

592
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,843
That year, an incredibly strange death

593
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,245
took place next to your property.

594
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:25,848
In the early 1920s,
a woman from here named Bertha Wilson

595
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,519
married a World War I vet,
this guy, William McCoy.

596
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:33,523
McCoy winded up getting gassed
by the Germans in World War I

597
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:35,091
and developed TB from it.

598
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:38,794
In 1925, his condition got really bad.

599
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:40,530
He was sent home to basically die,

600
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:43,616
and he was sent home to his foster parents,

601
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,701
who lived right next door.

602
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,470
Because he only had days to live,
his parents

603
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:50,056
had a Methodist minister come
in and do a baptism for him...

604
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,942
what they call a sprinkling.

605
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:55,211
But Bertha,

606
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:58,614
she wanted her husband to be
baptized in a full submersion.

607
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:01,350
Problem was,
his foster parents were against that

608
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,753
because his health was so bad.

609
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:08,925
Despite the arguing between
Bertha and McCoy's parents,

610
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,459
on April 9, 1925,

611
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:14,564
she hired a minister to come
in and perform this baptism.

612
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:18,751
And within minutes after him
going into this tub of water,

613
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:21,120
he dies.

614
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:22,371
Now, according to the death certificate,

615
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:25,308
they say he dies from tuberculosis.

616
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,893
Now, I got a newspaper article here

617
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:30,680
that shows there was a coroner's inquest,

618
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:36,068
and they put the blame on
Bertha and the minister.

619
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,853
Bertha was never charged.

620
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:40,223
I guess they were thinking
he was gonna die anyway,

621
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,058
but they never charge her.

622
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,493
I've got a photo of her.

623
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:48,231
This is her. This is Bertha Wilson.

624
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:50,516
Huh.

625
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,301
Is it possible that might
be the woman you saw?

626
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:56,556
Well, I-I did have a sketch done of her.

627
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,397
Looks like her.

628
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:09,201
Mm-hmm. You can definitely...

629
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,454
Even the eyebrows and everything
kind of looks the same.

630
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:12,705
The brows, definitely.

631
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,558
So, this lady's in my house.

632
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,326
Yes.

633
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:22,298
Is it possible she's doing bad things now?

634
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,133
Yeah.

635
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:25,768
Well, she kept showing me horrible things

636
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,937
she did throughout her life.

637
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:29,839
She was a sociopath.

638
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:33,843
Anything else?

639
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:35,778
Then, I went into the basement,

640
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
and there were these two people

641
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:42,451
that ran past me down the stairs.

642
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:44,487
And finally, when I got down in there,

643
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:48,591
I saw the group of people that were,
like, hunched down.

644
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:53,462
As far as the living picking
up on this would be, you know,

645
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:59,135
these transient feelings of extreme fear,
uh, panic,

646
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,970
or anxiety.

647
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:02,104
You hate the basement.

648
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:03,506
Mm-hmm.

649
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:07,293
When I go down there,
I don't ever feel like I'm alone.

650
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,178
I feel like there's someone watching.

651
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,846
Did you say something before about...

652
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,932
At the top of the stairs,
people went past you?

653
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,051
- Yeah.
- Tell Amy what happened.

654
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,003
I was going down the stairs

655
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:21,524
and went flying completely down the stairs,

656
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:24,377
felt like I was bumped or pushed...

657
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:27,063
- Okay...
- and landed up against the wall,

658
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:30,383
and I laid there and
screamed for several minutes.

659
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:32,968
Now, with all the stuff that's
going on in the basement,

660
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,403
could that have caused her fall?

661
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:37,423
Actually, I think it could be the woman.

662
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:41,143
I just feel like it's something
she would be capable of.

663
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:43,679
It explains a lot of things.

664
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,047
See, what I don't get is,

665
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,616
you're very devout. Right.

666
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:51,103
This woman, in my opinion,
was a zealot, but...

667
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:53,823
I don't think that she was a good person.

668
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,057
It actually scares me

669
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:58,828
'cause I don't know what
else she's capable of doing.

670
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,297
Is she gonna start targeting my kids?

671
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:04,567
So, what else happened?

672
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,735
Did you stay in the basement?

673
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:06,769
No.

674
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,087
So, I went upstairs,

675
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:13,142
and actually, everything kind of changed.

676
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:15,344
It was not good.

677
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:20,783
There was this very bizarre
thing that I was seeing.

678
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:23,719
This thing is very physical.

679
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,287
One of the things I saw it doing

680
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:28,474
was moving very quickly in the hallway area

681
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:33,879
and, uh, touch on the doors,
you know, bang them.

682
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,333
I think that people would hear this.

683
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:40,236
It looked like it came out of a swamp

684
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,671
because, like,
things were hanging off of it.

685
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,039
It's very dark.

686
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,575
Um, you know, it has, like,
a head and arms and stuff,

687
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:48,577
but it's, like, different.

688
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:51,647
Well, Amy and her son Jerrick

689
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,633
see this shadow figure all the time.

690
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,153
And it does move in the hallway,
back and forth,

691
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:58,854
back and forth, back and forth.

692
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:00,206
Do you ever hear the banging on the door?

693
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,974
Yes. Our doors will slam.

694
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,809
We'll hear doorknobs rattle,

695
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:08,197
and I've seen it standing
beside my bed at night

696
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,566
almost, like, towering over me.

697
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:15,204
And you saw the same thing?

698
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,272
Yeah. I just saw...

699
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:18,324
It was just jet black.

700
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,042
But what scared me the most

701
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:22,111
is, you can see right through its eyes.

702
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:25,214
- Oh.
- Distinctive.

703
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:26,549
And what else can this thing do?

704
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:33,222
What I saw in the smaller bedroom,

705
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,752
so I'm assuming your
younger son's bedroom.

706
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:36,442
Mm-hmm.

707
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:38,861
When he's asleep

708
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:42,164
is when it has its interactions with him.

709
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:47,336
And it was putting its hand into his face.

710
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:52,491
He won't sleep in his room.

711
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:54,810
He is scared to death of his room.

712
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:58,214
Matthias is autistic, as well.

713
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:02,051
Unfortunately,
the influence of this thing is,

714
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:06,322
people being prone to anger and rage,
bursts of it.

715
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:12,161
So it'll pick a person, uh,
for you to get angry at.

716
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:14,363
You bicker now like you never did before.

717
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:15,898
- Right.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

718
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,633
We love each other a lot,

719
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:20,419
but we have arguments about things

720
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:23,506
that never would have
become an argument before.

721
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:25,090
Jerrick's mood has changed, right?

722
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,342
His personality a little bit?

723
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:28,344
He has less of a tolerance.

724
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,845
With his brother being autistic,

725
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:32,097
he's quick to get more irritable with him.

726
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,816
Okay.

727
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:35,184
Interesting.

728
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:37,820
One incident that I saw in the main...

729
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,071
the master bedroom,

730
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:43,459
uh, was of an encounter with a female.

731
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:45,127
I feel her neck hurts.

732
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:48,163
Like, her spine in her neck, you know?

733
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:50,900
Then, it, like, slams her.

734
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,570
Tell her what happened.

735
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,155
One second, I was writing.

736
00:35:56,157 --> 00:35:58,657
The next second, I wake up on the floor.

737
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,909
I had been unconscious.

738
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,511
I had hit my head and
sustained a concussion.

739
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:06,098
But where I landed was so far
away from where I was sitting

740
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,901
that it wasn't like I simply passed out

741
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,252
and fell out of my chair.

742
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:13,038
And they did have to put
me in a cervical collar.

743
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,624
I was up in the air about
it being paranormal.

744
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:18,594
Yeah, I don't think you believed it.

745
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:20,563
Is that something this thing could do?

746
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:24,366
Oh, yeah. I think so, yeah.

747
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:28,337
The place where it made me really,
really nervous

748
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:30,306
was in the middle bedroom.

749
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:32,241
That's Jerrick's room.

750
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:36,245
What I felt was, like,
a hand around your throat.

751
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:38,964
It was, like, a pressure, like, on my neck

752
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:41,951
and then a pressure, like, on my chest.

753
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:46,121
I did have a sketch done of that.

754
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:55,598
Ah, geez.

755
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:59,835
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:26,269
I did have a sketch done of that.

757
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,845
Ah, geez.

758
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,049
I'm sorry.

759
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:56,700
Okay. Sorry.

760
00:37:56,702 --> 00:38:00,136
No, don't be sorry. It's your son.

761
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:03,423
Has he ever relayed that
kind of feeling to you?

762
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:08,211
He wakes up feeling awful almost every day.

763
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:09,646
He did convey to me,

764
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:11,348
when I interviewed him that,
uh, he was sitting on the bed,

765
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,099
watching TV.

766
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,001
And it felt like a man's hand

767
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,487
had slapped him right across the thigh.

768
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:19,973
That would be similar...
along the lines of...

769
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:22,025
of what this thing can do.

770
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:25,929
I don't want that to happen to Jerrick.

771
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,798
I don't want it to happen
to anybody in this house,

772
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,352
but I didn't expect to
see something like that.

773
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:34,104
What does this thing want?

774
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:38,758
It has a real disdain for your son.

775
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,511
It definitely wants to harm him...

776
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:44,781
without a doubt.

777
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:51,888
Amy, remember when you told
me that whatever is here

778
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,690
is evil and doesn't want
you or the kids here?

779
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,275
- Yes.
- Well, unfortunately,

780
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:56,860
you were right.

781
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:59,429
Now, the big question is,
can you get rid of this thing,

782
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:01,881
protect your kids,
and live the life that you guys

783
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,583
want to live here as a family?

784
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:05,869
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

785
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:12,676
Well, this case is cause for concern.

786
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,310
So, basically,

787
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:16,830
what we have is an
environment that has created

788
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:20,917
a semi-functioning PK manifestation.

789
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,686
What it did, seemingly,

790
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:26,089
was, over time,
the house absorbed personalities,

791
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:30,110
situations, memories,
things that it witnessed

792
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:35,498
and then, eventually, spit out an entity.

793
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,618
Now, usually, PKs are formed by people.

794
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,706
This is the first time I've
seen one formed by a house.

795
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:45,041
And the reason it's become so active

796
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:50,046
since you've moved in is your son.

797
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:53,216
I believe he has PK abilities.

798
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:00,657
I think that, because there was already

799
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,060
a semi-functioning PK manifestation here

800
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:05,979
and he came in,

801
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:09,115
it was the perfect storm.

802
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:13,069
And I think that he really needs help.

803
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,074
I knew something bad was going on here.

804
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:20,443
I knew something did not want us here.

805
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:26,783
Well, the problem is that there's not a lot

806
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:29,919
that can be done about this.

807
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:34,290
But if you take him away
from this location,

808
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:38,294
any attacks would cease.

809
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:43,366
But this thing will still exist here,
which is unfortunate.

810
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:44,434
But in the interim,

811
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:46,102
- Jerrick's not safe.
- No.

812
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:48,838
And you guys aren't safe.

813
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:55,361
Honestly, I would leave.

814
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,247
When a PK is formed by people,

815
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,582
there are things they can
do to protect themselves.

816
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:02,118
But, in this case,
when it's formed by the house,

817
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,656
there are only two options...
tear it down or get out.

818
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:10,310
I've already been assaulted twice, I feel.

819
00:41:10,312 --> 00:41:13,062
And seeing what's happened to my son,

820
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,647
they're both gonna be sleeping with me

821
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:18,501
until we can figure out
a way to get out of here.

822
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:21,321
That's gonna be something
that we'll have to talk about.

823
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:24,741
No.

824
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,010
I'm their mom. My job's to protect them.

825
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:30,380
It's just not a chance I'm willing to take.

826
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:34,184
- Okay.
- It's just the way it is.

827
00:41:34,186 --> 00:41:36,186
So, it sounds like your wife
already made up her mind.

828
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:38,471
Yeah. It's a shock.

829
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:40,390
We knew something was going on...

830
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:44,260
- Right...
- but not to this extent.

831
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:48,515
Yeah. We'll be... We'll be leaving.

832
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:50,033
Okay.

833
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:52,235
It breaks my heart
to tell Amy and Phil

834
00:41:52,237 --> 00:41:54,587
that I believe they
should leave their home.

835
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:56,172
But if they don't, I fear this house

836
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:58,274
and the PK manifestation it's created

837
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:01,511
could put them and their
children in serious danger.
