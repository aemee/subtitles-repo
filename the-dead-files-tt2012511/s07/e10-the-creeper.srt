1
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:14,328
I think that people
would feel this presence.

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,670
I got scratched down the middle of my back.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,701
This guy has got (bleep) issues.

4
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,142
Well, he pulls out his
pistol, shoots him five times

5
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,637
in the chest.

6
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:29,592
I'm scared for myself,
for our whole family.

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,896
He's really creepy.

8
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,730
He's a sociopath.

9
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,568
Something bad's going to happen.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,837
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,427
There's panic.

12
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:43,996
And it's almost like a butchering.

13
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,347
I see dead people.

14
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,416
They all died horribly.

15
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:48,751
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,619
Get out of here.

17
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,087
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,587
Vicious.

19
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:56,992
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:58,827
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

21
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:00,362
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,830
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,999
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,584
This guy's a real piece of work.

25
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:08,870
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,238
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

27
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,107
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:13,570
This is not good.

29
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,394
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:17,462
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,498
Until the very end...

32
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:20,832
I want my life back.

33
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:22,918
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,447
Is he trying to kill her?

35
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,749
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,356
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,138
This is going to kill us.

38
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,007
I'm in Coupland, Texas.

39
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:47,587
It's a small city just outside of Austin.

40
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:53,193
I got called in by a mother
of two who sounded really bad.

41
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,466
She got married a couple of years ago

42
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,801
and moved in with her new husband.

43
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,453
Then, all hell broke loose.

44
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:59,699
She's scared for her kids,

45
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,153
she's scared for herself
and she's just plain scared.

46
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:05,989
She told me she's got
no one else to turn to.

47
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,429
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,732
I clear the house of
any leading information,

49
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:18,802
removing family photos
and other personal items

50
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:22,105
that may influence her findings.

51
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,259
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:35,285
Last night,

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,524
I had an encounter with
a dead person, a male.

54
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,365
My shirt was kind of lifted

55
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:46,896
and my stomach was, like, caressed.

56
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:51,768
It was inappropriate, and
the touch was very cold.

57
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:58,830
There's two females that are alive,

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,879
who think, he's some kind of a perv.

59
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:06,471
He is the main person here

60
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,478
who's causing problems for the living.

61
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:17,782
Well, Sharon, I'm glad I'm here

62
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,150
because listening to you on the phone

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,980
and how scared you guys are
here was real concerning to me.

64
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,185
What's going on?

65
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,291
Well, we're being terrorized in our home.

66
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,694
Okay, what are we talking about?

67
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,327
From being pushed and shoved

68
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:35,729
to a lot of things that
are a lot worse than that.

69
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:36,868
When you say a lot worse,
you're talking about?

70
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:38,732
Being touched intimately.

71
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:44,355
It's okay.

72
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:45,310
Yeah, I mean, there's
things that are just...

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,645
it's just horrible.

74
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,309
Things are happening in
our house, at this point.

75
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:51,290
And it's just I'm scared for myself

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,193
and for our whole family.

77
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,524
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

78
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,409
This is why we took the case.

79
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,027
We're at a breaking point.

80
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,557
I told my husband, I was like,

81
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:04,503
"I'm done. I can't do this."

82
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,987
Now, who exactly are you living here with?

83
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:08,084
Here is a photo of our family.

84
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:09,391
There's myself,

85
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,005
and my husband J.D., our son Nicholas,

86
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,810
our only daughter, Madelyn,
and our middle son, Jacob.

87
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:19,646
I understand you got married recently.

88
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:22,182
Did you and J.D. buy this place together?

89
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,090
No, he built the home in 2006.

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,958
And now how long have you been living here?

91
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:29,428
We've lived here for the last two years.

92
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,290
Now, when did it start getting
really bad for you guys?

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,765
Not until about seven months ago.

94
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,167
- Seven months ago?
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,235
Is everybody on this
photo having experiences?

96
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,816
It's mostly the women in the house.

97
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
It's me, it's my daughter.

98
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:44,237
We're the ones being
physically attacked in the home.

99
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,923
Like, you don't even
want to change clothes,

100
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,047
because if like... if
there were a peeping Tom

101
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:52,011
in your window watching you.

102
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:54,113
I'm just ready for this to be over.

103
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,416
This has been a nightmare for us.

104
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:02,522
The dead guy who touched
me last night is in here.

105
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,924
This guy's not good.

106
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,909
I feel like he's in here a lot.

107
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:13,249
It makes you feel like
you're being studied.

108
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:17,053
I think that people
would feel this presence.

109
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:22,125
This... like you're under
a microscope or something.

110
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,648
He's really creepy.

111
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,284
I don't think he has a conscience.

112
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,843
This is the most active
place in the whole house.

113
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:44,469
We've seen, like, a black
mass, kind of like a cloud.

114
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,672
- Okay.
- Another time, laying in the bed,

115
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:49,307
I sat straight up when I saw him.

116
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,550
And it was a man standing
at the end of my bed.

117
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,445
And it was like he had on a trench coat

118
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,970
and almost like a fedora hat.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,376
And how often are you seeing him?

120
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,012
Pretty much all the time.

121
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,352
Anything else going on in here?

122
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:03,983
I got scratched... this burn
down the middle of my back.

123
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,152
And my husband lifted my shirt

124
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:09,589
and he was like "You've
got a huge scratch down..."

125
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,492
It was right, perfect in
between my shoulder blades.

126
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,394
- Nothing else could have caused that?
- Nothing.

127
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,895
No cats or anything running around here?

128
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,363
Un-uh.

129
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,503
There's something burning.

130
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,493
Yeah, like a burning sensation

131
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:30,543
with, like, little prickles of heat.

132
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,652
I'm gonna assume that
somebody in this location

133
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,953
is having this experience

134
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:38,818
and it is associated with
this younger dead male.

135
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,421
It's possible somebody is getting cut.

136
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:47,894
There is this physical agitation
that's happening to somebody.

137
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,501
All right, ls there anything else going on?

138
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:59,973
One night we were in bed, and I woke up

139
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,625
and I could feel two
hands around my throat.

140
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,709
I was being choked.

141
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,250
And I could feel the thumbs

142
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,281
especially just pushing down so far.

143
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:12,485
And I was just, like...
and could not breathe.

144
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,742
You sure it wasn't a nightmare?

145
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:17,140
I was wide awake, sitting
there trying to wake my husband.

146
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:20,343
But that was your breaking
point was getting choked?

147
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:22,996
No, that one wasn't.

148
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,464
What was?

149
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:31,571
We were in bed and it felt
like something running its nail

150
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,745
along the backside of my leg.

151
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,909
I was touched...

152
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,612
very intimately touched.

153
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:40,863
Did it feel like a man's hands,

154
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,387
or could you even tell what it felt like?

155
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,483
I knew it was a man.

156
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,617
Okay.

157
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:45,518
That was my breaking point,

158
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,021
because I was like,
"If it'll do that to me,

159
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,556
what could it do to my daughter?"

160
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,492
We have got to get help.

161
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:54,394
We have to get help.

162
00:07:57,265 --> 00:08:01,000
This younger dude, he's being nasty.

163
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:06,622
He's saying that this (bleep) deserves

164
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,510
whatever he's doing to her.

165
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,715
I feel a lot of choking right away,

166
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,583
a lot of pressure in the head.

167
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:18,690
Really bad.

168
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,354
Pressure in the jaw really bad.

169
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:24,924
Having the breath knocked out of you often.

170
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,005
So, Mattie, I was talking
to Mom and she was telling me

171
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:35,535
about what you guys are
going through in here.

172
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:36,587
You're how old now?

173
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,905
I'm about to turn 15.

174
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:39,890
Mom said you've been having experiences.

175
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,009
I'll be laying in bed and, you know,

176
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,613
and my door will be
open and I'll see, like,

177
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:50,810
a shadow figure just walk
past my door, like, real quick.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,205
It looks like a shadow,
but, you know, more 3D.

179
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:56,993
Like, in a month it probably

180
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,413
would happen about two times.

181
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,849
And you're positive it's
not somebody walking past.

182
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,134
I'm positive.

183
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,270
I hate to even ask you this,
but is there anything else?

184
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,071
I was laying down in my bed

185
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,791
and I got up to go to the
kitchen to get a drink,

186
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:11,805
and right as I was about
to walk out of my door...

187
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:15,397
the frame of my door, I got
shoved back into my guitars

188
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:17,394
that are right by the foot of my bed.

189
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,500
And it cut me.

190
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,835
There was blood.

191
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:20,702
That night when I got pushed,

192
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:23,683
I just sat in my bed and I cried.

193
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,121
How much do you and Mom
talk about this stuff?

194
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:29,286
She's told me a lot...
everything, honestly,

195
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:30,821
that's happened to her.

196
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,144
And it does scare me,

197
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:36,015
because if it's willing to
do that to her who, you know,

198
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,345
- has her husband by her side,
- Right.

199
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,836
then what could happen to me

200
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,217
when I'm on the other
side of the house, alone?

201
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,419
- Right.
- So, that definitely scares me.

202
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:50,591
I know he's in here a lot.

203
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,946
This living person

204
00:09:55,976 --> 00:10:00,984
might be influenced by
this dead man's behaviors.

205
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,294
He's a sociopath.

206
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:11,595
So, he wants to be in
control, be in charge.

207
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,199
He is just staring me the (bleep) down.

208
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,826
So, J.D., I was talking to your wife

209
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,527
and she was telling me
about the horrific things

210
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:47,628
that are going on here.

211
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,192
At the beginning, it was
fine before my wife moved in.

212
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:53,195
And after she moved in,
everything just started

213
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:55,686
getting weirder and weirder.

214
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:56,971
Were you having any experiences

215
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,939
before all this other
stuff started happening?

216
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,919
A little bit. My grandma died.

217
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:04,362
Every once in a while I'd
turn and I'd just see...

218
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:05,674
I'd just see her standing there.

219
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,931
I just chalked it up being that.

220
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,332
I paid it no nevermind. Okay.

221
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,212
And when did she pass?

222
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:11,947
Two and a half years ago.

223
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:13,562
Okay, did she live close by?

224
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,284
My grandma lived right behind us.

225
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:16,285
- She did?
- Yep.

226
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:17,920
I got a picture of her.

227
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,208
How old was she when she passed?

228
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,415
- 89.
- Okay.

229
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,562
Do you mind if I ask what she died of?

230
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,219
- She hit her head on the sink.
- Okay.

231
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:29,882
I'm sorry to hear that.

232
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,667
- Were you close with her?
- Yes, sir.

233
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,019
Now, how often do you
think you see grandma?

234
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,888
Almost every week. Really?

235
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,524
Is she kind of, like, looking over you.

236
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,359
I believe so.

237
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:46,965
What the hell?

238
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:53,138
The feeling I'm getting
is somebody with a cane.

239
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,775
I think it's a female.

240
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,727
Older female, maybe.

241
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,498
And I'm getting something
weird with the head.

242
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,369
Maybe it's stroke or something.

243
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:11,106
She is often confused.

244
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,022
So now, what about experiences
after your wife moved in,

245
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:22,874
did you have anything happen?

246
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:25,325
Yeah, one night I had a
picnic table in the back

247
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,012
and I go out there at night and sit on it.

248
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,715
And I just see all these
shadows coming in and out.

249
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:31,849
What did they look like?

250
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,184
Army men.

251
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:36,754
Then I look over here
and I see, like, Indians.

252
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,384
And look over here and cowboys.

253
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,813
I mean, so you're seeing
all kinds of things.

254
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,659
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,177
I mean, were you drinking out there?

256
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:45,424
- No, sir.
- Okay.

257
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,993
I've never dealt with this before.

258
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:51,836
I'm worried about them hurting
the kids and everything.

259
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,699
I just want it gone.

260
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:11,750
I do feel like there are
a lot of bodies... around.

261
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,588
Somehow they're trapped with their bodies.

262
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,109
They're able to reach
out and call for help.

263
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:29,134
There's one specific guy who is dead.

264
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,870
And he is old.

265
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:34,373
He's around, like, 1900.

266
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,376
And he was a tough, tough guy.

267
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,251
He's bad off here, trapped.

268
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:43,220
And he is, I think,

269
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,557
the strongest one of these people,

270
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:49,388
as far as reach... being able to reach out.

271
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,423
He's, like, the main mummy.

272
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,298
How old are you?

273
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,438
10.

274
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,774
I understand that you might
have seen a couple scary things

275
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:05,042
in the house here.

276
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,471
Can you tell me about one of them?

277
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:10,381
Whenever I'm sitting in
the living room watching TV,

278
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,583
I just see this person out
of the corner of my eye.

279
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,919
It's a black figure.

280
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,515
And then it glared at me.

281
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:17,783
I looked at it.

282
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:20,493
And then right when I
turned around, it went away.

283
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:22,568
And how do you know it was glaring at you?

284
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,436
I just saw the eyebrows go down.

285
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,744
- Like that?
- Like that.

286
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:28,941
So, what else scared you in the house?

287
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,664
On the other side, in the dining room,

288
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,194
there was a white figure.

289
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:36,064
This one just came closer
to me and just stared at me.

290
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,533
And I looked at it and it went away.

291
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,085
Are you scared to stay here?

292
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,386
Mm-hmm.

293
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,372
So, there's a lot of beds in here.

294
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:44,945
Where do you... where would you sleep?

295
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,942
- This one.
- Up on top here?

296
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:48,276
Okay.

297
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:51,029
I just really don't like
sleeping in my bedroom alone.

298
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:52,281
Okay.

299
00:14:56,954 --> 00:15:03,825
There's one person in
here who is being targeted

300
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:07,362
by the dead that aren't able to rest.

301
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,899
They are talking all the time

302
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,919
to the person that's in the top bunk.

303
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,673
It's too much for this person.

304
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,442
It's a lot of information.

305
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,344
What kind of information?

306
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:28,784
This person is seeing
the old man from outside.

307
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:34,339
Well, he's mummified, but
it's, like, a corpse screaming.

308
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:39,594
Open mouth, kind of hanging,
crooked and emaciated.

309
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,465
And he's, like, getting
in bed with the person.

310
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,072
That creeped me out.

311
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:46,298
I don't...

312
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:50,205
That's some weird (bleep).

313
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,444
First thing I do when
I start an investigation

314
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:12,240
is pull the property deed.

315
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:13,708
Turns out one family,

316
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,728
the Stebers, owned the
property for over 53 years.

317
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,352
And when I contacted a genealogist

318
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:21,472
to look into it for me, she
said their time on the land

319
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,735
was filled with death and heartbreak.

320
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,600
Dr. Alexander, thanks
for helping with my case.

321
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,913
I appreciate that.

322
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,115
Now, what can you tell me
about the Steber family?

323
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:40,118
In about 1867,

324
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,888
Michael Steber came over from Bohemia,

325
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,468
which is part of Czechoslovakia now.

326
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:48,877
- Okay.
- He was 17 years old.

327
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,895
Then he gets married.

328
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:54,849
He marries Rosa in 1871.

329
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,009
So, when did they wind up

330
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,140
- on my client's property?
- ln 1892.

331
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,247
All right, now, you mentioned tragedy.

332
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:04,409
So, what happened?

333
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,915
In 1895, Michael vanished.

334
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:13,552
The family looked for him,
neighbors looked for him.

335
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:18,195
He disappeared at the age of
45 and was never seen again.

336
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:19,758
What about suspects?

337
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:23,311
Well, there was one possible suspect.

338
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,869
That was John Henry, his stepson.

339
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:26,572
Why?

340
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:30,001
Because he and his father
used to argue bitterly.

341
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,975
Okay, but no body, so no
charges were ever brought up?

342
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,728
No charges were ever brought against him.

343
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:35,979
Okay, Michael is missing.

344
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,115
He's never found. What
happens to the property?

345
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:41,830
Well, in 1909, the land
is transferred to Rosa.

346
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,766
She turns it over to her
son shortly thereafter.

347
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,373
This is the stepson they thought
might have had something to do

348
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:48,103
with his disappearance, right? Yes.

349
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:49,738
What do I need to know about him?

350
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,875
In 1926, he dies of stomach cancer.

351
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:54,910
Who gets the property now?

352
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:57,312
His son, George. How did it go for George?

353
00:17:57,397 --> 00:18:00,382
Not all that lucky for George.

354
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:04,408
In 1940, George had a number of daughters,

355
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:07,277
and three of them went
up to the swimming hole.

356
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:07,996
Okay.

357
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:12,733
And the youngest one,
Helen, went in swimming.

358
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,363
And she started to struggle.

359
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:20,919
The two oldest sisters
jumped in to help save her.

360
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:22,571
Aw, look at that.

361
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,601
Victims.

362
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:27,275
Both of the older sisters died.

363
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:30,345
Geez. What a shame.

364
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,747
And here is the newspaper clipping.

365
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,823
And that's where everybody swam.

366
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,091
That was the big swimming hole.

367
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,194
Okay, so, this can't be the
only drowning deaths there?

368
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:42,029
I don't know if there are other drownings,

369
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,298
but I do know in 1921

370
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:48,179
there was a flood and
hundreds of people died.

371
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:58,212
I'm hearing something
about a lake to my left,

372
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:02,077
which is really weird,
considering where we are.

373
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,145
Then I hear, "Cemetery."

374
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:08,028
So, I'm thinking that there are bodies

375
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:11,219
in or very near the water.

376
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,622
And somehow they're mummified.

377
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,799
And there were kids, little kids.

378
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,735
Like, from 5 to 10, I would say.

379
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,965
And they were singing
"Ring Around the Rosie."

380
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:25,884
What the (bleep) was done to them?

381
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:32,456
I can't figure out other
than it being some kind

382
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:37,312
of pressure in the chest and upper back,

383
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:40,231
like maybe drowning.

384
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,850
Weird.

385
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,451
What?

386
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:47,422
I heard someone say,
"The children perished.

387
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,291
It was bad."

388
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,917
I've got to find out more
about this massive flood

389
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:58,316
and how it might have
affected my client's property.

390
00:19:58,402 --> 00:20:00,018
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

391
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,304
who said it was one of the
biggest natural disasters

392
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,306
in the town's history.

393
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,350
Randy, what can you
tell me about this flood?

394
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:19,020
It actually started Friday
the 9th of September, 1921.

395
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,522
It was caused by a tropical storm

396
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,412
that had moved inland into Mexico

397
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,409
and then moved north into Texas

398
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,362
and just poured rain onto the county

399
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,786
for a day and a half, two days.

400
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:32,289
It dumped at least 38 inches of rain.

401
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,048
The creeks rose by 40 feet.

402
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,558
What are we talking, as far as devastation?

403
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:36,297
What happened?

404
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,478
You can see on some photos that we did find

405
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,942
- some of the aftermath.
- Wow.

406
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:43,528
Just from a few days after.

407
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,515
The floor waters came in
at such a sudden surge,

408
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,439
a lot of people had to cut their way out

409
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,358
through the roof of their homes.

410
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:54,689
Farm houses, livestock, people...

411
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,863
Anything in its path was just swept away.

412
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:58,760
So, there would have been
just pandemonium and panic?

413
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:00,000
Correct.

414
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,152
Now, I know that Brushy
Creek is like 500 feet

415
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,236
from my client's property.

416
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,122
So, that area had to get destroyed.

417
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:07,702
Oh, absolutely.

418
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,255
Statewide, of the bodies
that were recovered

419
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,247
that we know of, there were 224
that perished in the flooding.

420
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,669
Geez. So, how did it impact my property?

421
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,365
How many people died in that area?

422
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,618
- There were at least 93 bodies recovered.
- Wow.

423
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,466
So, we're talking more
than a third of the bodies?

424
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:26,239
Correct.

425
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,406
The greatest concentration
of deaths did occur

426
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,809
within that Williamson County area.

427
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:37,816
Something about these bodies,

428
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:41,352
they want the house to be torn down.

429
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,688
I don't know why.

430
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,491
How many bodies?

431
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,026
There are quite a lot.

432
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:52,187
At least 20 to 50 maybe.

433
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,716
Do you know how they died?

434
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,945
Something with that weird
pressure (bleep) and water.

435
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,509
I don't (bleep) know.

436
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,109
Okay.

437
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:03,530
Most of them died badly.

438
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:24,621
Now that I know the original owners

439
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:26,023
of Sharon and J.D.'s property

440
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,236
suffered from mysterious
death and heartbreak

441
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,655
and that a flood killed dozens in the area,

442
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,658
I need to know if there's anything else.

443
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,816
Searching through old
records, I find an article

444
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:38,413
about a young war vet named
George Williams who murdered

445
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:41,449
a retired farmer right next
to my client's property.

446
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:45,378
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police chief

447
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:48,593
who's gonna tell me all
about this bizarre case.

448
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,880
This homicide, what happened?

449
00:22:56,316 --> 00:23:00,819
May the 1st, 1959, we've
got two guys headed to work.

450
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:03,669
Kelly Frederick picks up George Williams,

451
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,012
who's a buddy of his.

452
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,041
They work together.

453
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,443
George Williams lived hand to mouth.

454
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,517
Didn't have a car, couldn't
drive himself to work,

455
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,781
had to depend on a friend to get him there.

456
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:15,150
This morning though,
after he gets in the car,

457
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,125
George Williams pulls a
pistol, a.32 caliber revolver,

458
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:20,027
and forces Kelly Frederick

459
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,524
to drive him to a little country road

460
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,093
next to your client's property.

461
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:27,062
And he says, "Get out of the car."

462
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:29,166
So Kelly gets out of the car

463
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,667
and George Williams steps out of the car

464
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,831
and begins to shoot at him, unprovoked.

465
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,488
Well, Kelly Frederick
figures, "The only way

466
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:35,655
I'm getting out of this alive

467
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,702
is to get back in the car and drive away."

468
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,165
Okay, now, that's not the guy
that gets murdered, though.

469
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:39,838
No.

470
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,257
So, George Williams ducks off the road.

471
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,909
He approaches a retired
farmer, Charlie Heise.

472
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,161
67 years old,

473
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,246
out having a little
fishing fun in the morning.

474
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:50,187
"Need a ride to Austin."

475
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,333
Heise says, "Where do you live?"

476
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,250
He said, "Well, I live in Austin.

477
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,558
That's why I need a ride down there."

478
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:56,660
Heise doesn't respond quick enough.

479
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,973
Williams pulls out his pistol,

480
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,110
shoots him five times in the chest.

481
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:02,299
So, George Williams takes the keys

482
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:05,269
out of his pocket, goes up, steals the car,

483
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,132
heads west to Austin.

484
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:09,000
24 hours later, he's in custody.

485
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,008
They immediately bring him back.

486
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,076
And there's your picture
of George Williams.

487
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:16,358
May the 3rd, he also
gives a full confession.

488
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,389
In the confession, did
he say anything about,

489
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,976
like, what his motivation was?

490
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:21,148
Never said a word.

491
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,429
I thought I read somewhere
that he was a vet.

492
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,352
He was. He'd gone to the Korean war.

493
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,736
He called nine witnesses in his trial.

494
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:30,811
All nine witnesses said
when he came back from Korea,

495
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:32,228
he was different.

496
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:33,313
What happened with the trial?

497
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:35,582
Well, he was found
guilty, sentenced to death.

498
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:39,180
He was executed July the 8th, 1960.

499
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:45,437
They take him in at 12:02
A.M. to the death chamber,

500
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:48,073
shave his head, put a
wet sponge on his head,

501
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:51,348
put a metal cap over the
top of that, strap it down.

502
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,078
Put a rubber ball in his mouth,

503
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:56,549
and they ran about 50,000
volts through his body.

504
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,238
At 12:05, they threw the switch.

505
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:01,976
At 12:09, he was pronounced
dead in the chair.

506
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,728
And, of course, interestingly enough,

507
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:08,498
his death certificate
says legal electrocution.

508
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:11,001
Now, look at that.

509
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,020
He was only 30.

510
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,050
Right.

511
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:24,542
This guy has got (bleep) issues.

512
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:33,518
And he is good at holding
that information in tight.

513
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,058
This dangerous sociopath

514
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:38,022
is trying to block me from
seeing who he really is,

515
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:41,793
but I'm starting to get some
clues about who he was in life.

516
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,785
He's one of those people
that looks older than he was.

517
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:46,281
And how old would you say he was?

518
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:51,669
Late 20s, early 30s at the most.

519
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:53,844
So, you know when he's from?

520
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:55,723
He's recent.

521
00:25:55,842 --> 00:26:00,645
One thing is that he was
in financial ruin, I think,

522
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:02,847
at the time of his death.

523
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:06,317
There was something weird with his mouth

524
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,019
and I can't place it.

525
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:12,056
He's one of those people

526
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:16,694
that would make you feel very
uncomfortable around them.

527
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:20,704
He was really intense when he was alive.

528
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:25,244
A very good actor of emotions, you know?

529
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,706
Because he doesn't really have any.

530
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:29,696
That's, I think, why he's still here.

531
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,376
Like, he likes it.

532
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:33,812
He doesn't have to pretend anymore,

533
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,915
so he's got free rein.

534
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,744
During my walk,

535
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:48,476
I saw a sociopath terrorizing
women in the house.

536
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,749
I'm meeting with this sketch artist

537
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,413
to draw him as he appeared in life.

538
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:55,655
His chin is kind of shorter than average,

539
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:59,554
and his forehead is smaller than average.

540
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:02,028
He's pretty buff.

541
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:06,661
Very piercing, large, round eyes.

542
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:08,796
Next, I described a disturbing scene

543
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,770
I saw in a little boy's room.

544
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,884
They kind of looked mummified.

545
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,208
So, they're buried in the ground.

546
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,744
A long, stretching arm and hand,

547
00:27:17,774 --> 00:27:21,559
like, coming from the corpse's head area

548
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:24,679
to the kid in the bed.

549
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,952
Is this what you saw?

550
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:34,756
Yes.

551
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:55,725
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

552
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:56,904
we're ready to reveal our findings

553
00:27:56,934 --> 00:28:00,132
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

554
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,044
Amy, I'd like you to meet J.D.

555
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:06,481
He had this house custom
built back in 2006.

556
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:09,072
Now, everything was pretty
quiet until he married Sharon

557
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:12,587
here about two years ago when
she moved in with her kids.

558
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,241
Now, we got a photo here
of the nuclear family.

559
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:19,611
So, this is nick, her son who is 16.

560
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:21,763
This is Mattie who is 14,

561
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:26,000
and this is J.D.'s son, Jacob, who is 10.

562
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:29,237
The activity really got amped
up about seven months ago?

563
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,039
Right.

564
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,531
And it turned violent.

565
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,344
Now, things are so bad here that
Sharon doesn't sleep at night.

566
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:39,213
She thinks the entire family
is in danger, and she's praying

567
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:43,384
that we find a way to help
her get out of this hell.

568
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:44,824
Did you have any...

569
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:48,395
or your children have any
prior paranormal experiences

570
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,629
before moving?

571
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:51,392
Yes. Okay.

572
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,761
When the children were small,

573
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,603
we were about 45 minutes from here

574
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,335
and we had experiences in that home.

575
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,237
They've been dealing with
this their whole lives.

576
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,065
When I got here,

577
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:13,620
what I was seeing was
a large body of water,

578
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm assuming a lake.

579
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:20,827
I was feeling this horrible pain,

580
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:23,791
and it felt like pressure on my chest,

581
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:26,149
feeling like it was being compressed.

582
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,713
It was really bad.

583
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:33,401
I also saw a lot of people.

584
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:35,368
I would say there was
about 20 to 50 of them.

585
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:43,678
And it seemed like they
were somehow mummified.

586
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:47,782
These people, more than
likely, died pretty badly.

587
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:50,068
And I was equating the water

588
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:52,904
and the pressure with maybe drowning.

589
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:55,478
Brushy Creek is literally
less than 500 feet

590
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:57,697
from the property here.

591
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:00,057
Now, back on September 9, 1921,

592
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,334
you guys had a natural disaster here

593
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,115
that was one of the biggest
in the county's history.

594
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:06,106
This neighborhood was ground zero

595
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:09,976
for a giant storm that came in.

596
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:13,458
You had 38 inches of rainfall
in a matter of 24 hours.

597
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,633
The creek levels rose up 40 feet.

598
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:20,698
I got a couple of pictures
from when it happened.

599
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,107
Wow.

600
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:26,254
Now, statewide, they recovered 224 bodies.

601
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:30,642
In this area alone,
they recovered 93 bodies.

602
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:33,761
But the toll is probably
a lot higher than that.

603
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,418
Now, you mentioned anxiety.

604
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:39,603
You deal with anxiety on

605
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,040
- a daily basis, right?
- Yeah.

606
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,338
You can feel that
pressure push down on you.

607
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,146
You feel that down on your chest,

608
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,926
where you have to go
outside to get away from it.

609
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:54,649
Okay, so what else did you
see on the walk-through?

610
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:58,886
So, when I came in inside

611
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:03,518
and I went to the bedroom
with the bunk beds, in there,

612
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:06,199
the dead that are in the ground...

613
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:10,064
you know, the mummified dead
are... mentally reaching out

614
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,801
to someone very much specifically in there.

615
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,803
She's talking about Jacob's room.

616
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:18,723
There's this one guy, one
of the mummified people,

617
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:22,910
and he is manifesting in the bedroom there.

618
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,085
You're pretty sure he's,
like, probably a flood victim?

619
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:28,266
Yeah, and I actually saw him

620
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:31,157
standing in the bedroom
at the end of the bunk bed

621
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:34,994
looking over to the person
that's in the top bunk,

622
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:37,492
trying to communicate with that person.

623
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:44,339
So, I saw this person, like,
seeing very brutal scenes.

624
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:48,858
Blood and guts and, like,
pain and, like, suffering

625
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:53,207
and all of this information
from all of these dead people.

626
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:55,276
Jacob won't sleep in his bedroom,

627
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:58,284
and he's the top bunk.

628
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:00,353
He's like, "Dad, I don't want
to sleep in there no more.

629
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,454
Something's not right.

630
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,072
I just don't want to sleep in there."

631
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,552
I think he's scared.

632
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:05,789
Okay.

633
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:11,058
Well, I had a sketch artist
do a sketch of what I saw.

634
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,052
Oh, what the (bleep)?

635
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:21,736
Are you kidding me?

636
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,107
Now, look, it's gonna be
hard for you to see, but...

637
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:27,909
Holy crap.

638
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,334
Oh, my poor baby.

639
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:00,258
It's not malicious.

640
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,894
He just wants his message out there.

641
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,731
As a father myself, I
would... Couldn't even imagine.

642
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:09,905
Yeah.

643
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:13,437
Tell me how to protect them.

644
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,224
That does bring me to an individual

645
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:19,110
who is in the house who is not good.

646
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:24,170
This person is a younger male

647
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,818
and he's absolutely a sociopath.

648
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:31,489
He does make people feel
like they're being watched.

649
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:33,975
I did get that he can be very physical

650
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,277
with people in the house.

651
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:39,146
And I got that he really
likes the purple bedroom.

652
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,483
Mattie, her daughter, well, she got pushed.

653
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,336
He is in there a lot.

654
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:48,222
The thing that he was doing to me was...

655
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:54,128
um... a burning sensation across my chest.

656
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,364
And I did feel like this was happening

657
00:33:56,394 --> 00:34:00,751
or has happened to somebody in the house.

658
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,837
I went into the master bedroom,

659
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:06,674
and then I immediately got
the sensation of being choked.

660
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:10,444
Um, and I felt like he wouldn't...

661
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,041
this dead guy wouldn't let
go of the female in there.

662
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:17,674
Oh. She just pretty much
described just about everything

663
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:18,775
that you told me.

664
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:20,905
- Yeah, one night in bed,
- Okay.

665
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:26,210
I woke up to two hands
around my neck, strangling me.

666
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,017
Now, you talked about the burning thing.

667
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:29,786
Now, Sharon, you've been scratched.

668
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:30,961
- It felt like a burning.
- Yes.

669
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,417
- Yeah.
- It was just burn down the middle

670
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,091
of my back, between my shoulder blades.

671
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:38,494
And I was like, "Something
just scratched me. It burns."

672
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:42,261
And it was just excruciating pain.

673
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,285
She's also been inappropriately touched...

674
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,759
- Yeah.
- You know, as well.

675
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,717
Yeah, I can see this guy doing that.

676
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:53,643
Woken up in the middle of
the night to a hand on me.

677
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:56,980
And I'm just, like...
hugged up next to my husband

678
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,197
and we'll just sit there and pray together.

679
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,127
And you can't get it off of you.

680
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:02,051
Is he some kind of a perv?

681
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:05,602
Um, obviously, he's focused on the women.

682
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:09,837
So, any idea who this
sociopath was when he was alive?

683
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,406
I think he was really in his 20s or 30s,

684
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:14,175
but he looked older.

685
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:17,792
He's very quiet, very reserved,

686
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:20,715
um, but I think he had
his moments where he would,

687
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:26,087
like, lose it and kind of go crazy.

688
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:29,595
He was in some type of financial ruin

689
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,514
when he died and, also,

690
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:33,433
there was something with his mouth.

691
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:38,430
And I think it has something
directly to do with how he died.

692
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,285
You said the guy was young,
in his late 20s, right?

693
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,820
- Maybe early 30s.
- Mm-hmm.

694
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,193
And a sociopath. Oh, yeah.

695
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:45,995
There was a murder
connected to the property,

696
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:47,838
but it was back in '59.

697
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:49,043
There was a guy named George Williams

698
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:50,277
who was a Korean War veteran.

699
00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:53,731
When he was 28 years old,
he worked as a laborer.

700
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,689
And every day for two months
straight, this guy Williams

701
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,120
would get picked up by
this guy Kelly Frederick

702
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,055
to carpool to work.

703
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:04,692
But on May 1st, 1959, he snapped.

704
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:06,787
He had him pull over to
the side of the road here,

705
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:10,865
right by your house and
pulled a.32 revolver on him.

706
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,535
Kelly Frederick, he escapes
and he took off with the car.

707
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,205
So, now this guy Williams
is walking around out here.

708
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:22,493
And Brushy Creek, he sees this
poor guy Charlie Heise fishing.

709
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:25,479
And he walks up to him and
says he needs a ride to Austin.

710
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:28,871
But before poor Charlie had
a chance to respond to him,

711
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:31,819
he put five bullets in
his chest and killed him.

712
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:34,255
Williams is tried, convicted.

713
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,456
Wow.

714
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,976
By July 8th, 1960, he's electrocuted.

715
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,877
I actually have his death certificate here.

716
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:48,035
It was legal electrocution.

717
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,553
But when she said it was
trouble with the mouth,

718
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,373
I know they put the ball gag in there.

719
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:55,042
They strap them down so they
don't bit their tongues off.

720
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,933
Now, I was able to
track down his department

721
00:36:57,963 --> 00:36:59,029
of corrections photo.

722
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,165
There's a chance this
could be the guy you saw?

723
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:04,981
Nope.

724
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:09,790
I did have a sketch done of the guy I saw.

725
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:17,865
You're right.

726
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:19,500
That's not him.

727
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,668
Oh, my god.

728
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:23,003
- But I've seen him before.
- Wait a minute.

729
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,005
Is this the guy you see in your bedroom?

730
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:26,300
Yes.

731
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,369
This guy will stare at you.

732
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,236
He'll sit back in the shadows.

733
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,333
He sits back in the shadows.

734
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:44,798
This person gets off on
watching and stalking,

735
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,911
terrorizing the females.

736
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:49,919
And, unfortunately, I think he
might have formed an attachment

737
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:54,001
and followed you from a previous home.

738
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:55,329
Wow.

739
00:37:57,824 --> 00:38:00,925
Sharon called us in desperation
because of what happened to her.

740
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,282
The physical, the inappropriate touching.

741
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:06,335
She was afraid it was gonna
possibly happen to Mattie next.

742
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:09,200
Yeah, I'm worried about that, yeah.

743
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:11,802
Because I think this
sociopath tagged Mattie

744
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,171
when she was a child.

745
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,624
When was her birthday? April.

746
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:17,844
April.

747
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:23,164
Which would be seven months ago.

748
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,499
That's exactly when things
got bad for you guys.

749
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:28,602
Yeah, that makes sense.

750
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:32,556
She's at a particular point in her life

751
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:37,383
that's very appealing to him.

752
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:38,805
Mm-hmm.

753
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,791
Sick. Sick.

754
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:01,306
So, Sharon, you've been choked,

755
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:04,242
scratched, inappropriately touched.

756
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,878
Both your kids are living in fear.

757
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:08,829
J.D., your house turned into a war zone.

758
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:09,969
Yeah.

759
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,583
But at least now we
know why it's happening.

760
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:13,823
Right.

761
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,358
The big question is,

762
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:18,189
how do we fix it so we go back
to our happy and normal life?

763
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:21,092
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to my partner, Amy.

764
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:25,969
So, I think there's two main things

765
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,771
that need to be dealt with.

766
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,636
First is the dead people outside,

767
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:34,411
because that is effecting your son.

768
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,863
These dead people,
obviously, they need help

769
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:38,898
and they need to be released.

770
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:44,332
So, the best thing to
do is to bring in someone

771
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:47,635
who is a psychic knower.

772
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:49,871
Now, someone who has that ability

773
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:53,480
can come in and really
assess what they are.

774
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,675
Once they do that,

775
00:39:54,778 --> 00:39:58,179
they'll know exactly what
to do to move them on.

776
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:01,949
All right, so, what about this jerk

777
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,285
that's perving on everybody?

778
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,422
Now, what I would like you to do for him

779
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:11,648
is to find a demonologist.

780
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:15,936
Because sociopaths, to me,
are demons in the flesh.

781
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:20,635
These people that are
like this are not human.

782
00:40:20,874 --> 00:40:25,809
So, this demonologist will
come in and will do an exorcism

783
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,516
to get rid of him.

784
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:34,488
He's freaking out a little bit.

785
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:39,387
So, it might take several sessions.

786
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:43,708
In the meantime, this is black salt.

787
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:46,416
So, what I want you to do
is every night before bed,

788
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,947
you sprinkle this all
the way around each bed.

789
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:54,221
That's what will keep
him from breaking through

790
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,571
and physically attacking.

791
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:59,891
Well, you look totally different
from the first time I met you.

792
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,399
I feel at peace right now.

793
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,666
There's, like, resolution.

794
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:06,247
I mean, there's a solution.

795
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,249
Whatever it takes to get everything

796
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,169
out of the house and
take care of my family.

797
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:12,720
I'm all for it.

798
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,927
We can do this.

799
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:15,206
We can do this.

800
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,641
Nothing is gonna hurt my kids.

801
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:18,609
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

802
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,813
I really hope Sharon
and J.D. follow my advice

803
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:24,932
and deal with the evil
surrounding their family.

804
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:27,985
With the help of a psychic
knower and demonologist,

805
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,960
they'll be able to free the
dead and banish the sociopath

806
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,241
that's been terrorizing them for so long.
