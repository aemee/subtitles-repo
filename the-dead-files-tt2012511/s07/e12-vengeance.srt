1
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:12,374
Yeah, they definitely
feel pain with this guy.

2
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:13,942
Come on.

3
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:17,312
It came at me so fast,
and then, like, swoosh.

4
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:20,215
There's times when she
really loses her [bleep]

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,182
Someone probably shot him.

6
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:23,702
Shot him twice. Killed him.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,955
Oh. Somebody dies.

8
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:29,290
I tell my kids everything's fine.

9
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:32,961
But I'm not sure if I'm
telling them the truth.

10
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,529
They want to kill someone.

11
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,898
They want to kill him.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,300
Something bad's going to happen.

13
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:41,903
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:43,138
There's panic.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,439
And it's almost like a butchering.

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,940
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:48,209
They all died horribly.

18
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,728
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:50,979
Get out of here.

20
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,447
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,282
Vicious.

22
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:57,352
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,220
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

24
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:00,755
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,290
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,392
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

27
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:05,994
This guy's a real piece of work.

28
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:09,264
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:10,532
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

30
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,500
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,035
This is not good.

32
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:15,837
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,906
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:19,908
Until the very end...

35
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,209
I want my life back.

36
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,278
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,879
Is he trying to kill her?

38
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,181
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:27,716
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:29,584
This is going to kill us.

41
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,633
I'm out here in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

42
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,835
I got called in by a woman

43
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,838
who sounded pretty damn
scared on the phone.

44
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,740
She says she's about to
take over a restaurant

45
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,375
that's been in her family for 40 years.

46
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:57,312
But the activity is so bad
she doesn't know if it's safe

47
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:00,014
for her and her children to be there.

48
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,583
She says, if Amy and I can't help her out,

49
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,952
she may have to close the place up.

50
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,724
Before Amy arrives,
I need to clear the restaurant

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,528
of anything that might
influence her findings.

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,314
Artwork, photographs

53
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:20,001
and religious icons need
to be covered or removed.

54
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,236
When I'm finished,

55
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:23,471
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

56
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,231
Okay.

57
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,218
Before I got here, I saw this location.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,357
And there was, like, nothing,
you know, like, no buildings.

59
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,494
It was all, like, just land and black.

60
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,914
This thing, uh, came up to me.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,134
And it pointed to the ground.

62
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:56,888
And then, I saw water trickling.

63
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:01,643
And then, the water all of a
sudden was flowing with blood.

64
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:11,352
So, Carla, I'm glad I'm here

65
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:12,687
'cause, when we spoke on the phone,

66
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:13,555
you sounded scared.

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,056
Right.

68
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,308
Okay. So give me a rundown
of what's going on.

69
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:20,595
We've got people hearing noises,
objects moving,

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,231
electrical problems, apparitions.

71
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,634
And people are being touched.

72
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:29,304
This business has been in
my family for 40 years.

73
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,722
I'm taking over.

74
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,707
My dad, this is his life's work.

75
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,809
And it's part of the family.

76
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:35,877
It's my whole life.

77
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,663
But I also want to protect my children.

78
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:40,782
I tell my kids that there's
nothing to be scared of,

79
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,333
everything's fine.

80
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:46,504
I'm not sure if I'm telling them the truth.

81
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:49,474
Okay. So, now, who exactly works here?

82
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,894
There's all of us. That's my mom. She's 82.

83
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,512
That's my son. He's 16.

84
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,299
That's me. That's my dad. He's 84.

85
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,368
And that's my daughter. She's 13.

86
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,873
My daughter particularly
has increased my concern.

87
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:08,476
She's so genuinely frightened.

88
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,228
Now, have you lost any, uh, staff

89
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,512
- because of what's going on here?
- I have.

90
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,899
And I've had to change
people's schedules also who...

91
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,351
They'll, like, refuse to close

92
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:19,070
or be alone in the restaurant at night.

93
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,889
I mean, I don't like to be in
here alone at night either.

94
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,340
I mean, how are you managing,
never mind everybody else?

95
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:23,458
What about you?

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,327
There's just days I don't want to come in.

97
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,529
Sometimes, I get really anxious,

98
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,398
particularly when I'm at work.

99
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,300
Now, is that something you
experience away from here?

100
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,468
No.

101
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,203
What are you hoping we can do for you?

102
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:38,740
I want you to tell me that I can stay here

103
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:42,343
and I can honor my dad's life's work

104
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,563
and I can be the good
daughter and the good mom.

105
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,320
There's a lot going on.

106
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:55,406
I mean, a lot of residual...

107
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:01,896
There's a lot of men, pandemonium.

108
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:03,281
They're drinking and partying.

109
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,134
They're getting crazy.

110
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,835
Do you think it would
affect the living here?

111
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:11,606
Oh, I think that they
would feel, uh, dizzy.

112
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:15,910
It's crowded. You feel this,

113
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,112
feeling claustrophobic, you know?

114
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:19,464
Very unsettled.

115
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:21,633
Uh, your stomach kind of does flip-flops

116
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,954
just because of all of this crazy,
uh, energy.

117
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,594
So, why'd you bring me behind the bar here?

118
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:36,998
This is where I feel something
breathing on my neck.

119
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,666
What part of your neck do you feel it on?

120
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:39,834
- Is it always on the same part?
- Mmhmm.

121
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,419
- That side.
- Okay.

122
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:42,370
So it's enough where it's...

123
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,905
it's gonna go through your hair.

124
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,739
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

125
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,324
- Right.
- Okay.

126
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,543
Now, how often does this happen to you?

127
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:49,877
At least once a month.

128
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:53,414
And when it's happening,
it seems like it's forever.

129
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,216
Huh. Not like you got...

130
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,051
No vents.

131
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,020
Any other physical things happen here?

132
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:04,492
So my back bothers me more
here than anyplace else.

133
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,694
Now, what makes you think
this is paranormal?

134
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,030
I can have had several
days of no back pain at all

135
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:11,699
and get here and have my back start to...

136
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,067
to feel badly.

137
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,236
What if Amy tells you,
"It's not safe for you to stay here.

138
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:16,971
You really need to go"?

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,457
I feel very committed

140
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,909
and responsible to keeping
the business running.

141
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:24,479
But I wouldn't want my
kids to ever be harmed.

142
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,948
Right. And so you're kind of
stuck right in the middle.

143
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,816
Always.

144
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:34,255
Somebody got stabbed to death.

145
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,691
You know, this is, like, his area.

146
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,597
Oh, he doesn't feel very, very good.

147
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,699
It's a lot of pain.

148
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:51,639
I think that people would
have physical pain

149
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,426
associated with being around him,

150
00:06:55,512 --> 00:07:01,749
so, like, sudden lower-back issues,
acute stomach pain.

151
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,253
Like, you'd be like, "Oh,"
you know, like, [bleep]

152
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:09,090
He acts out when he's depressed. Ow.

153
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:13,928
Yeah, they definitely feel
[bleep] pain with this guy.

154
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,797
Come on.

155
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,918
So, Edie, I'm really glad I
got a chance to talk to you

156
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,488
'cause your mom's most concerned about you.

157
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,973
- Yeah.
- Are you scared to be here?

158
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:29,043
Whenever I'm here, I can never just relax.

159
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,629
I'm always, "Was that just a shadow?"

160
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:34,115
One night, close to midnight almost,

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,734
I was just sitting in the dining
room playing a video game.

162
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:40,421
And then, all of a sudden,
I heard, like, a woman cry,

163
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:43,124
like a woman crying out in agony and pain.

164
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,926
Any idea how old the woman that was moaning

165
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,260
might have been?

166
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:47,795
Maybe kind of middle-aged.

167
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,130
Was anybody else in the building?

168
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,482
My mom was in the kitchen
closing up the back door.

169
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,634
Okay. Do you know if this door was locked?

170
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:54,702
Yeah.

171
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:57,171
That's strange.

172
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:58,539
Now, is anything else going on?

173
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,842
Well,
the scariest thing that has happened to me

174
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,494
is I actually got trapped in the bathroom.

175
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,480
- This bathroom here.
- Right there.

176
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,014
I go in there. I use the bathroom.

177
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,083
I wash my hands. I dry my hands.

178
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,052
Then, I try to open up the door.

179
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:14,589
And it was almost as if somebody
was pushing the door shut

180
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,607
as I was trying to open it.

181
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:17,692
You... you don't think
it was somebody playing

182
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,494
- a game on you, do you?
- No, not at all.

183
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:20,995
- How'd you get out of there?
- I kicked the door.

184
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,196
So, ever since then,

185
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,448
you've been pretty frightened
to death of this place.

186
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,467
Yeah. I refuse to go to the bathroom alone

187
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:27,518
at night anymore.

188
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,037
Okay. All right.

189
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:31,372
So, sweetie, it sounds
like you and your mom

190
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,874
have a pretty close relationship.

191
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,809
Oh, yeah. We're really close.

192
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:38,079
I'm curious how you feel about
her being here alone at night.

193
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,732
I don't know if something
would come actually at her.

194
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:44,218
I just don't want anything
to happen to her.

195
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:49,907
I feel anxious back here.

196
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,560
I just hear, like, a... a male.

197
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,379
He's like, "Ha ha, you stupid [bleep]"

198
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:59,200
Like, "That'll teach ya."

199
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:02,203
He seems like a stocky fella.

200
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,871
Kind of making me sick.

201
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:07,508
And he's got some guy,
drops him on the floor.

202
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,079
And he's, like, kicking him.

203
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:15,116
This guy killed this dude.

204
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,450
Lots of anxiety, too,

205
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,620
that they would feel back here,
like, heart racing.

206
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,993
Something is with the doors.

207
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,629
He's trying to keep the door closed

208
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:32,750
'cause he's always like,
"Close the [bleep] door."

209
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,468
He's a problem.

210
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,604
Obviously, he was prone to violence.

211
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,606
He killed someone.

212
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:42,043
He could be physically
violent towards the living.

213
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,115
The reason your mom called us in

214
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,250
is because of the fact

215
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,285
that she's worried about
you and your sister.

216
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,620
It's a family-owned business.

217
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:12,289
I mean, grandparents have
had it for over 40 years.

218
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,708
She eventually wants you guys to take over.

219
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,493
How do you feel about that?

220
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,278
The business has been around for 40 years.

221
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,781
And I'd love to keep it
around for another 40.

222
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:23,167
But I don't feel comfortable
running a business

223
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,552
in a building that's potentially haunted

224
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,887
with entities that could harm people.

225
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,873
Okay. Well, let me ask
you a question, then.

226
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,291
Are you afraid to be here?

227
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:32,960
Yes, especially at night.

228
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,845
That's when I'm most afraid to be here.

229
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,680
Okay. So, what experiences
have you had, Charley?

230
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,649
So I've had two experiences.

231
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,784
Throughout that door, into the Santos Room,

232
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,387
I saw a cowboy sitting at
the last seat of the bar.

233
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,922
And he's in a brown trench coat.

234
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,140
And he has, like, a cowboy hat on.

235
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,558
He's drinking a beer.

236
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,026
And I thought that was really strange

237
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,394
because it was, like, 8:00 in the morning.

238
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:51,929
The restaurant wasn't open yet.

239
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,364
And when I got through to the other side

240
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,349
and I looked through
the bar and the gallery,

241
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:56,800
there was nobody there.

242
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:57,968
Okay. So, it just disappeared?

243
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,720
Yes, it just disappeared.

244
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,505
You said there were two things.
What was the second one?

245
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,707
The second one actually
happened right behind us.

246
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,793
I was going through that doorway.

247
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,695
And as I passed through the hallway,

248
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,380
I looked through the
double doors to the window.

249
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:12,016
And I saw a woman floating there.

250
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,917
But she had no arms and no legs.

251
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,035
Her hair was down.

252
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,570
How long would you say her hair was?

253
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,640
Uh, it was probably about,
uh, 2... 2 feet long,

254
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,942
kind of down to a little
bit past her shoulders.

255
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,460
Did you think you were seeing things?

256
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:24,845
Basically, I had, like, an anxiety attack.

257
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,365
And I was crying and
traumatized, basically.

258
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,838
There's, like, this little woman here,
probably in her 40s.

259
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,307
She's chubby, short.

260
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,675
She's a busybody.

261
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,613
She seems really, um,
new to this whole thing,

262
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,082
like, being dead.

263
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:49,753
She's trying to interact
with this male and female.

264
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,056
But she says,
"They're not hearing, you know,

265
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,607
they're not hearing me."

266
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,775
She's not seeing a reaction.

267
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,893
Mm-hmm.

268
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,796
Or, at least, the reaction she wants.

269
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,970
So, Shirley, I was talking
to your daughter.

270
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:09,423
And, uh,
she was explaining of some of the problems

271
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,275
that are going on in the restaurant.

272
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,526
Honestly, I'm... I worry about it.

273
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,694
And I'm concerned about it.

274
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,979
Particularly, I think Edie, she is scared.

275
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,247
I don't want her to be afraid.

276
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,249
And I don't want my daughter to be afraid,
you know?

277
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:20,601
Right.

278
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,587
My partner, when she does these cases,

279
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,773
and then, at the end,
sometimes, she'll tell them,

280
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,991
"Listen,
you need to get the hell out of here

281
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,226
or close your business."

282
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:32,513
How would you feel about
something like that?

283
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:33,730
Would not want to do it.

284
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,300
This is the legacy for my family,

285
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:39,036
what my husband and I have
built all these many years.

286
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,939
And, uh, I want it for my
daughter and my grandchildren.

287
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:43,474
I would not want to go.

288
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:44,858
In the 40 years you've been here,

289
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,794
have you had any experiences?

290
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,046
Well, actually, the first 32 years,

291
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,348
I really didn't have any
personal experiences.

292
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,851
But about eight years ago, I did, yes.

293
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,018
Okay. So, what happened?

294
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,621
Late one night, I opened up that door.

295
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,890
The minute I stepped into this room,

296
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,559
a ghost lady came... I was standing there.

297
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,261
She came from this side of the room...

298
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:05,195
Okay.

299
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,914
At me so fast, and then,

300
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,616
like, swoosh, right passing through me.

301
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,569
I turned totally, totally cold,
totally, totally cold.

302
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,138
Can you describe her at all?

303
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:15,772
- I would say small.
- Small.

304
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,374
- Small, yes.
- Okay.

305
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,576
Was that the only experience
that you actually had here?

306
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:20,911
Uh, no.

307
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,597
We actually had something
strange happening in here

308
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:24,982
with the lights.

309
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,083
Maybe two or three of them

310
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,601
would just be flickering, flickering.

311
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,387
So I had two different electricians come.

312
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,556
So, what did the
electricians wind up saying?

313
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:35,659
Neither company that ever
came out ever found anything.

314
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,232
That little woman, she is very frustrated.

315
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:46,069
She's very angry with them
when they're not talking to her

316
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,071
or listening to her or whatever, you know?

317
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,306
She gets real worked up.

318
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:53,243
And then, I see her hair,
uh, get all, like, crazy.

319
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,212
Uh, so she's, like,
whipping around in a circle

320
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,415
and freaking out.

321
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,717
I think, that at those times,

322
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,555
maybe the living might have
some electrical issues.

323
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,859
And the living might notice that.

324
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:17,134
I think this is where the
little lady is mostly.

325
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,970
She's, like, bopping around, you know,

326
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:22,890
and, like, just in everybody's [bleep]

327
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,743
And I do see her getting in a rage.

328
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,914
Ooh, she's not happy.

329
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,849
She's kind of having a mental breakdown.

330
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:49,662
I didn't think it
would be hard to find history

331
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,030
on Carla's restaurant.

332
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:54,283
I mean, after all,
it sits right in the middle of Old Town.

333
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,285
Turns out, it was easier than I thought.

334
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,953
The first historian I reached out to

335
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,922
said that one of the early
owners of the property

336
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:03,459
suffered through years of debt,
regret and betrayal.

337
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,832
So, Julia, you mentioned on the phone

338
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,200
one of the first owners of the property

339
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,369
I'm investigating had a
lot of heartache there.

340
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,737
What'd you mean by that?

341
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,208
- Carlos and Felicitas Vigil
were married in 1910... - Okay.

342
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,611
And moved into the property in 1920.

343
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,380
She was pregnant with her third child

344
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,398
when they moved into the property.

345
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:28,767
About five months after they moved in,

346
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:30,819
their youngest, a little boy named Willie,

347
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,289
he passed away.

348
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,590
Okay. What was the cause?

349
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:36,375
Gastritis.

350
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,027
How'd it go for them after that?

351
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,495
Ernesto was born.

352
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,163
But he did pass away as well.

353
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,632
He was 1 year, 1 month old.

354
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:47,603
He had an infection that was
caused from bottle feeding.

355
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:52,808
And he passed away in 1922.

356
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,761
However, Felicitas becomes pregnant again.

357
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,646
Her name was Frances.

358
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,566
But Frances was only 2 months old

359
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,817
when she passed away.

360
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,035
Geez.

361
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:08,223
She died in April of 1924
of a bronchial pneumonia.

362
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,326
I'm afraid to even ask.
Did they have any more kids?

363
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,360
They did.

364
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,513
This time, the baby was stillborn.

365
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,765
Felicitas was so devastated

366
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:19,652
she couldn't even bring
herself to name the child.

367
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,123
I mean, just losing one child
alone has got to destroy you.

368
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,474
Destroy you.

369
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,559
She lost four.

370
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,428
Four in a row.

371
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:33,666
Not very long after the stillborn, um,

372
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,035
Carlos actually became ill.

373
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,203
And what was his problem?

374
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,254
Syphilis.

375
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,557
Turns out, Carlos was unfaithful.

376
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:42,441
Ah, so now I know what you meant

377
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,426
when you said about betrayal.

378
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:46,662
She actually had him committed

379
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,665
to the New Mexico Hospital for the Insane

380
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,201
until he passes away in 1927.

381
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:54,136
And when he died,

382
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,121
she did not claim his body.

383
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:57,773
Does she stay? Does she
decide to move away?

384
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,074
No, she stays.

385
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,777
She does, uh, start to become quite ill.

386
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,113
And eventually, she does have a stroke.

387
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,914
And she died in January of 1959.

388
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,984
Okay. So now, she dies in '59.
What happens to the property?

389
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,354
She left the property to
her surviving children.

390
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,106
Uh, they kept it for a few years.

391
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,125
But then, they sold the property.

392
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,595
15 years after Felicitas died,

393
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,765
the building became the High
Noon Restaurant and Saloon.

394
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:29,972
This angry woman,
she died fairly recently, I think,

395
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,607
maybe, like, a sudden heart attack

396
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,009
or something along those lines.

397
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,978
Do you know how old she was?

398
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,100
Uh, she looks, mm, maybe 50s or 60s.

399
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,219
And she's, like,
being very obsessed with her family.

400
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:49,622
Yeah, she's feeling more grateful about the
decision to do with her family in this building,

401
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,679
maybe leaving it to them or something.

402
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,515
Like, I am seeing a For Sale sign.

403
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,285
Mm, she's not happy.

404
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,784
I've already uncovered five people

405
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,671
who died on my client's property,
four of them children.

406
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:08,055
But I need to see if there's anything else

407
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:11,192
that can help my case.

408
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,527
Searching through old records,

409
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:15,730
I find a 16-year-old
who was fatally stabbed.

410
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:17,515
Turns out, he lived right across the street

411
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,802
from Carla's restaurant.

412
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:22,186
I need to find out a lot more

413
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,589
about this brutal attack
on the 16-year-old kid.

414
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,374
And when I want to know about a homicide,

415
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,009
I reach out to the cops.

416
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:30,094
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police officer

417
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:32,330
who's looking into this case for me.

418
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,788
Well, Officer Tixier,
thanks so much for helping me out

419
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:41,956
with this case. I appreciate it.

420
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:43,724
- My pleasure.
- So, can you do me a favor?

421
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,027
Before we get to the murder
of this 16-year-old kid,

422
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:47,628
what do you know about the family?

423
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,130
Luis Moya moved his family

424
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,766
onto your client's property in 1941.

425
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:54,268
And then, just a short time,
five years later,

426
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,053
he moves his family off
your client's property

427
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:58,189
but just directly across the street.

428
00:18:58,308 --> 00:18:59,473
So, they're in the immediate area

429
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,125
when this homicide happens?

430
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:02,176
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

431
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,878
So take me through the homicide.

432
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,298
So, uh, Luis Moya has a son, Freddy Moya.

433
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,599
Him and his friend,

434
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:10,735
they walk down the street
to a New Year's Eve party

435
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,104
that was being held at the armory,

436
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,289
basically to ring in 1951 into '52.

437
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,374
As they walk into the party,

438
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,192
they kind of separate, go their own ways.

439
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,177
And as the night is progressing,

440
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,930
a group of about 10 to 13 individuals

441
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:25,366
from the Atrisco street
gang come into the party.

442
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,118
And I can see where this is going already.

443
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:29,470
One of those people was Paul Garcia.

444
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:30,288
Okay.

445
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,906
Details are sketchy about

446
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,708
what exactly transpired between the two.

447
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,243
But what we do know is that

448
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:38,312
a lot of witnesses saw a commotion

449
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:41,382
between Paul Garcia and Freddy Moya.

450
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,850
Okay.

451
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,386
And then, they saw Freddy turn pale.

452
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:46,370
They take him out of the armory.

453
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,705
And that's when they realized

454
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,924
that he had been stabbed
pretty severely twice,

455
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,560
once in the back and
then once in his chest.

456
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:55,696
And that chest wound
actually severed his aorta.

457
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,331
- So he bled out.
- Bled out almost immediately.

458
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,266
Okay.

459
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,634
Paul Garcia confessed,

460
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,086
was found guilty and did 15 years for it.

461
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:03,471
Okay.

462
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,106
What a way to bring in the
new year for a family, huh?

463
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,742
Yes, sir.

464
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:10,711
I'm seeing a lot of fighting.

465
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:15,766
The guy who's got stabbed, he's back here.

466
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,389
Frankie, Frank.

467
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,691
I'm seeing the guy who got stabbed again.

468
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:28,195
But this time, he's making me
experience his painful death.

469
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,664
Really bad, too.

470
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:33,567
He got stabbed in the front and the back.

471
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,069
I'm just feeling it.

472
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:39,724
I think he feels betrayed and,
like, got murdered.

473
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:01,069
You know,
another thing stood out in my research.

474
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,787
The local town marshal

475
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,890
was hanged just down the
street from Carla's restaurant.

476
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,258
Now, you don't hear about law enforcement

477
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:08,976
getting the death penalty very often.

478
00:21:09,062 --> 00:21:10,228
So I called a local author

479
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,630
who said Milton Yarberry was so hated

480
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:15,716
people lined the streets
to cheer his execution.

481
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,243
So, Johnny,
this story's pretty interesting to me.

482
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,310
So there was a town marshal

483
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,229
that was actually hanged
right down the block

484
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:29,781
from my client's property.

485
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:31,099
Milton Yarberry.

486
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:33,351
He's born in 1849 in Arkansas,

487
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:37,054
joins an outlaw gang,
kills a couple men in Arkansas.

488
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,159
And that's gonna send him
fleeing Arkansas into Texas.

489
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,261
Okay. So he's got a couple
murders under his belt already.

490
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,496
By 1879, at least four.

491
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:46,731
Wow. How does a guy

492
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,900
that's got at least four
bodies under his belt

493
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:52,320
wind up in Albuquerque and as a marshal?

494
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,655
He arrives in Albuquerque in 1880.

495
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,908
He's traveling with a woman named Sadie

496
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,444
and her 4-year-old daughter.

497
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:03,881
When he arrives here,
he's gonna befriend Perfecto Armijo,

498
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,550
who is the county sheriff.

499
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:08,252
Perfecto gets Yarberry the job

500
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:10,705
as Albuquerque's first town marshal.

501
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,223
He apparently liked the way

502
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:15,259
Yarberry knew his way around guns.

503
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:16,994
And this is Yarberry here.

504
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,196
That's Yarberry.

505
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:19,363
Looks like a tough piece of work.

506
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:20,948
Yeah, he does.

507
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,633
So, this guy doesn't know
anything about his background?

508
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:24,702
- No.
- Geez.

509
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,137
So now you got a killer with a badge.

510
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:27,605
How does this work out for the town?

511
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,526
In 1881, Sadie,
the woman he came to town with,

512
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:34,745
is apparently seeing another man,
Harry Brown.

513
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:39,050
So Yarberry comes to talk to Harry Brown.

514
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:40,868
I'm assuming he probably shot him.

515
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:43,588
Shot him twice. Killed him.

516
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:47,959
And Perfecto Armijo has
to arrest his friend.

517
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:49,010
What happens with Brown?

518
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:50,278
Well, during the trial,

519
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:53,598
it's brought out that Brown had a gun.

520
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,733
Yarberry pleads self-defense.

521
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:56,934
And the jury acquits him.

522
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,036
Within a few weeks,

523
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,973
he's back on the job as the town marshal.

524
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:04,942
But a few weeks after that shooting,

525
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,160
there's another one.

526
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,180
And that one's gonna get
Yarberry in serious trouble.

527
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:12,049
He's investigating a shot
that's been heard fired in town.

528
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,018
He sees a man running down the street.

529
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:15,436
He yells stop.

530
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,089
When the man doesn't stop,
Yarberry shoots him.

531
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,924
Again, the charge is murder.

532
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,094
And this time, it takes the jury 10 minutes

533
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:25,563
to find him guilty.

534
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:30,017
And Milton Yarberry is sentenced to hang.

535
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:32,236
2,000 people showed up.

536
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:34,205
They are lining the streets.

537
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,039
They are heckling.

538
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:36,941
They are booing him.

539
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,729
I'm hearing a lot of men yelling.

540
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:44,649
Uh, I think they're angry.

541
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,685
Um...

542
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:52,623
it seems like there's something
big happening, going down.

543
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,459
And they're, like, on top of buildings.

544
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:59,380
But they...
but the buildings kind of look different.

545
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:00,364
Somebody did something.

546
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:01,882
They want to kill him.

547
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,335
They're walking this
man through the streets.

548
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:06,270
And he did something very bad.

549
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:12,093
It's like he's on parade or something.

550
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:13,611
It was a circus.

551
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,913
In fact, I found this article.

552
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,099
Local businesses were selling tickets.

553
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:21,068
For a dollar,
you could go up to the rooftop.

554
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:24,689
So it's likely that the
business you're investigating,

555
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:27,908
people were up on that roof
watching the execution.

556
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:29,760
Wow.

557
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:32,597
But it doesn't go as planned.

558
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,065
Armijo found in a journal

559
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,667
this new method of hanging somebody.

560
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:37,952
It's called the jerk method.

561
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,004
And it's supposed to be a more humane way

562
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,973
of executing somebody.

563
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:45,676
But when he's jerked up,
his head hits the crossbeam,

564
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,628
and his skull is crushed.

565
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:49,380
This execution is so botched

566
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:52,216
they can't get the noose off his neck.

567
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,986
So he's buried with the rope still on him.

568
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:58,255
Wow.

569
00:24:58,358 --> 00:24:59,924
He's white.

570
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:01,692
He's well-known.

571
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,395
I don't know if he was, like,
maybe some kind of lawman

572
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:07,999
or some [bleep]

573
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:11,469
He says that sometimes,
he wasn't always a lawman.

574
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,704
So, what the [bleep] was done to him?

575
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,456
But I don't know.

576
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,842
I think the guy gets hanged.

577
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:30,354
I saw several dead people during my walk.

578
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,523
But two stood out the most.

579
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,626
First, the killer I saw in the kitchen.

580
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:38,963
He is late 30s maybe.

581
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,967
He had a very Italian-looking nose.

582
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:47,388
And his eyes were closer
together than normal.

583
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,173
Next, I described the angry woman

584
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:51,809
trying to get the living's attention.

585
00:25:51,894 --> 00:25:56,514
She was, like,
grabbing his arm, shaking him.

586
00:25:56,616 --> 00:26:00,184
She has really long, black hair.

587
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:01,452
And when she gets mad,

588
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,988
it's kind of, like, whipping around.

589
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,397
Is this what you saw?

590
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,500
Yes.

591
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:39,715
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

592
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,014
we're ready to reveal our findings

593
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,451
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

594
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,052
Now, Amy, in 1974,

595
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,421
Shirley and her husband
opened this restaurant.

596
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,390
It took a lot of blood, sweat and tears.

597
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,492
But it became a success.

598
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,027
Recently, they turned the High Noon over

599
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,495
to their daughter, Carla.

600
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,330
And that's kind of when
the trouble started.

601
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,032
Activity's gotten physical.

602
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,068
And Carla's two kids are
pretty scared to be here.

603
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:04,020
This is actually a photo of the two kids.

604
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:06,189
This is Charley, who's 16.

605
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,208
And this is Edie, who's 13.

606
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,010
Now, Carla's in a tough spot.

607
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,945
She wants to honor the family legacy

608
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,981
and keep the restaurant going.

609
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,399
But she's also a worried mom.

610
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:18,151
And she doesn't want to stay here

611
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,586
if it's not safe for her kids.

612
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,888
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

613
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,924
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

614
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,628
When I first got here,

615
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,365
there was this commotion going on outside.

616
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,168
Uh, there were a lot of men.

617
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,771
And they were yelling and screaming

618
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,973
and just kind of going nuts.

619
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,710
A lot of them were on the rooftops.

620
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,879
Then, I noticed a group of men

621
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:48,215
kind of walking down the street.

622
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,650
In the center of all of these men

623
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,137
was this one man that they
were kind of manhandling.

624
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:57,424
They hated him and wanted to kill him.

625
00:27:57,526 --> 00:28:01,111
And then, I believe that he was hanged.

626
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,429
Wow.

627
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,214
I didn't really have to think
about this one too long.

628
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,400
There was a guy in 1883 by
the name of Milton Yarberry,

629
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,352
who was hanged just down the block here.

630
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,353
Okay.

631
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:13,139
Milton was born in Arkansas in 1849.

632
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:15,408
He started a life of crime pretty young.

633
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,561
By the time he got to Albuquerque in 1880,

634
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,179
he had already killed four men.

635
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,666
I actually managed to
track down a photo of him.

636
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,886
Wow.

637
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:27,387
Pretty intense-looking guy.

638
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:31,041
Now, somehow, this illiterate murderer

639
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,828
became friendly with the
local sheriff of Albuquerque.

640
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,631
He was Perfecto Armijo.

641
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,232
Perfecto made a bad decision

642
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:42,485
and made Yarberry Albuquerque's
first town marshal.

643
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,740
Now, Yarberry finds out that his girlfriend

644
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:49,609
was cheating on him with
this guy named Harry Brown.

645
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:52,078
So, how does he handle it?
Handles it with a gun.

646
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,347
Tracks him down.
And he shoots him, kills him.

647
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,750
He was tried for murder even
though he was the marshal.

648
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,084
But he was acquitted.

649
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,770
Now, you think he would lay
low after that happened.

650
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:01,755
He didn't.

651
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,156
Only a few weeks later,

652
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,760
he winds up, uh,
responding to a shots-fired-type call.

653
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,495
And he sees a guy, tells him to stop.

654
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,996
He's walking away.

655
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,666
And he shoots him three times
in the back and kills him.

656
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,117
He gets tried again.

657
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:17,921
This time,
he's found guilty and sentenced to hang.

658
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,008
Now, on February 9, 1883,

659
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,944
he was paraded through the
streets here in Old Town

660
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,112
on the way to the gallows.

661
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,614
Wow.

662
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:29,115
Now, you said people were drunk
and rowdy and stuff like that?

663
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,283
Oh, yeah.

664
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,335
Building owners here
wind up selling tickets

665
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,037
for $1 apiece for people

666
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,172
to actually watch the
hangings from the roof.

667
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,490
So, most likely, people

668
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:40,226
were cheering his execution
on your rooftop that day.

669
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,561
Wow.

670
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,098
Interesting.

671
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,634
So, uh, what else?

672
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:50,654
There's three different
conscious dead people here.

673
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:52,806
One of them was a female.

674
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,708
She was in her 40s.

675
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,978
I met her in the reception area.

676
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,981
What?

677
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,382
Continue talking. It's a...

678
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,750
Okay.

679
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,252
The other area that she
likes to hang out at

680
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,322
is that dining area.

681
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:10,573
She was short.

682
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,226
She had extremely long, beautiful hair.

683
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,295
And it was dark.

684
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,963
She was attempting to interact

685
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,932
with the living male and female,

686
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,318
trying to talk to them
and trying to grab them,

687
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,137
trying to shake them.

688
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:29,259
And she feels like they're not hearing her.

689
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:33,396
And she would get extremely upset.

690
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,648
When that would occur,

691
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:39,686
her hair would go up and get all crazy.

692
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:43,189
And this is how she's
expressing her frustration.

693
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,924
Now, the reason they
reacted the way they did

694
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,726
when you described her in that room

695
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,396
is a lot of people have seen this woman.

696
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:50,730
Lots of people.

697
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,450
I stepped into the dining
room very late one night.

698
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,685
And the minute I stepped into the room,

699
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:58,138
she just came rushing at me and went, like,

700
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,622
like, right through me.

701
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,175
I screamed. I really screamed.

702
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,563
Now, the funny thing is Charley,
your son, saw a similar thing.

703
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,681
Explain to Amy what Charley had seen.

704
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,784
He was walking down the back hallway

705
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,119
and just looked through the windows

706
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:16,556
and saw a figure, a woman in white...

707
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,091
- White. Hmm.
- ...in this room.

708
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,642
Okay.

709
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:22,328
So I had a sketch done of this woman.

710
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,664
And she was trying to,

711
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,968
um, get the attention of a particular male.

712
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,639
Oh, geez.

713
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,508
This is how she looked when you saw her?

714
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,177
That's upset, all right.

715
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,349
That's scary.

716
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,452
That's where I work mostly.

717
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,053
That's definitely the space

718
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,290
where so many people feel,
you know, a presence.

719
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,827
In my mind,
I was thinking she wanted me out of there.

720
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,962
She wanted me out of her space.
She wanted me out of her place.

721
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,748
Interesting. Okay.

722
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,799
Now, did you get any idea

723
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,035
who this woman might have been in life?

724
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,487
She knew that she was ill before she died.

725
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:08,174
But her actual death
came pretty sudden, uh,

726
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,577
something like a sudden heart attack.

727
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,679
She might have died recently.

728
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:15,648
She looked like she was in her 60s.

729
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:20,737
Um, there seemed to be
some issue with her family.

730
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,939
I did see a For Sale sign.

731
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,025
And she was absolutely unhappy about it.

732
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:30,096
I think that she regretted the decision

733
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,899
that she made about this location

734
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,368
and possibly leaving it to her children.

735
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,804
That's interesting.
That's really interesting.

736
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,056
There was a woman that
lived on the property here

737
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,475
that suffered a lot during her time here.

738
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,411
Felicity Vigil and her husband at the time,
Carlos,

739
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:47,380
bought this property in 1920.

740
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,499
After moving here, she lost four kids...

741
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,750
Whoa.

742
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,386
Within five years,
all under the age of 2.

743
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,188
Now, to make things worse for this woman,

744
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,390
her husband contracted syphilis.

745
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,608
Now, she didn't have it,

746
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,477
which only meant that he
had to be cheating on her.

747
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,113
But the disease damaged Carlos' brain.

748
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:08,168
And she had him committed to
the state mental hospital.

749
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,470
Now, he died in 1927.

750
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,305
I got his death certificate here.

751
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,774
She didn't even claim his body.

752
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,743
She just left it there.

753
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,078
Now, Amy, you mentioned this
woman suffered from a disease

754
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,330
and then died suddenly.

755
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:23,650
Felicitas suffered from high blood pressure

756
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,252
and caused her to have a stroke in 1959.

757
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:29,756
I have her death certificate here.

758
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:32,358
Now, she was here a long time, 39 years.

759
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,494
But she died on the property.

760
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,563
Now, you mentioned she had
regret about leaving this place

761
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,815
to her kids,
and that's exactly what she did.

762
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,567
She left it to her daughter and two sons.

763
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,702
- Okay.
- Now, just a few years

764
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,239
after they got the property after she died,
they sold it.

765
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:48,458
It's kind of sad when you think about that,
you know?

766
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:51,010
So she probably said, "Oh, look.
I'm leaving you this.

767
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,779
It's our legacy,"
kind of like the way your mother

768
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:53,913
and father are leaving you...

769
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,031
- Right.
- ...the restaurant, you know?

770
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,916
And... and here, her
kids just abandoned it.

771
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,252
It's sad. It's very sad.

772
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:02,689
Now, you said there were three dead people.

773
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,007
Who else did you see?

774
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,992
I encountered a male

775
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,112
who apparently was being
stabbed in the front

776
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:12,599
and then got him a couple
of times in the back.

777
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:15,034
I got the name Frank or Frankie with him.

778
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,870
He was indicating that he felt betrayed,

779
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,573
and he feels a lot of pain and depression.

780
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,575
So I felt like, around the bar area,

781
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:25,878
people would feel this kind of pain,
stomach pain,

782
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,380
lower-back pain.

783
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:28,948
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

784
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,750
Tell Amy about that.

785
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:32,051
I get the back pain.

786
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:33,653
Okay.

787
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,421
You know,
I think I'm gonna be able to figure out

788
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,775
who this might be for
Amy and for you as well.

789
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,076
You said the name Frankie.

790
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:41,277
Yes.

791
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:42,545
The guy I'm gonna tell you about,

792
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,414
his name is Freddy Moya.

793
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,416
Now, Freddy was a kid who lived
on the property with his parents

794
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,034
from '41 to '46.

795
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,736
Then, they moved right across the street.

796
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:50,970
When Freddy was 16,

797
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,856
he went with a friend to
a New Year's Eve party

798
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,341
right down the street at the armory.

799
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,310
They were ringing in 1952.

800
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:00,647
Now, 13 gang members from
the Atrisco neighborhood

801
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,065
wind up coming into the party.

802
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,784
And, uh, Freddy was attacked
by one of the gang members.

803
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,620
He was stabbed several times
exactly where you said...

804
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:08,655
Oh, wow.

805
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,556
The chest and in the back.

806
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,792
Now, the stab wound in the
front is what killed him.

807
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,295
It was so bad it severed his aorta.

808
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,729
Then, five minutes after midnight,

809
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,698
he was pronounced dead.

810
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,550
Now, do you think this could
be the kid you ran into?

811
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:21,467
Yes.

812
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:23,019
Okay.

813
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:26,272
So we have the lady who died
and the stabbing victim.

814
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,374
But you said there was a third dead person.

815
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,226
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- So, who was that?

816
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:33,479
The third dead person I ran
into was in the kitchen area.

817
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,349
And he's the one I'm most concerned about.

818
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,335
Immediately, I felt sick, uh, nauseous.

819
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:42,238
Um, I felt intense neck pain.

820
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:45,958
And then, I felt like hands
were on my neck squeezing.

821
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,094
I heard a male laughing and saying,

822
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,014
"You stupid [bleep] That'll teach ya."

823
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:56,602
I saw the image of one
man killing another man.

824
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,939
I got that he was stocky
and seemed to be in his 30s.

825
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:03,076
Because he was such a violent,
nasty person in life,

826
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,547
he could possibly, uh,
be violent and nasty in death.

827
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,683
The other thing...
He's kind of obsessed with doors.

828
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:14,537
He has to have the doors closed.

829
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,489
Talk about Edie with the bathroom incident.

830
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,192
Right. So my daughter went to the restroom.

831
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:21,310
And when she went to
open that bathroom door

832
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,062
to pull it open, she felt like

833
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,733
someone was pushing it shut
so that she couldn't leave.

834
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,936
It really, really scared her.

835
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,204
You get a good look at him?

836
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:33,406
I did. I had a sketch done.

837
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:37,076
We could put a face to maybe
some of the problems here.

838
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,115
He's a mean-looking guy.

839
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,318
I can tell you that.

840
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,220
Look at that.

841
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,143
Wait a second. Take a look at this guy.

842
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,629
Holy [bleep] take look at this.

843
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:58,748
Take a look at this photo.

844
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,184
Now take a look at this sketch.

845
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,069
Oh, my God.

846
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,737
- What do you think?
- Brows look very much alike.

847
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,923
You can see the resemblance, the wide nose,

848
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:10,276
the wide bridge nose.

849
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:13,045
This guy scares the crap out of me.

850
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,317
I had a sketch done.

851
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,787
We can put a face to maybe
some of the problems here.

852
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,794
He's a mean-looking guy.

853
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:40,880
I can tell you that.

854
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:44,617
Take a look at that.

855
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:46,336
Wow.

856
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:49,789
Wait a second. Take a look at this guy.

857
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:52,275
Holy [bleep] look at this.

858
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,344
Take a look at this photo.

859
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:56,796
Now take a look at this sketch.

860
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:58,715
Oh, my God.

861
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:00,733
- What do you think?
- Brows look very much alike.

862
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,602
You can see the resemblance, the wide nose,

863
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:05,421
the wide bridge nose.

864
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:09,392
This guy scares the crap out of me.

865
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:11,561
The sketch looks just like Yarberry,

866
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:12,862
the marshal who was hung.

867
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:13,963
Yeah. Look.

868
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,969
Look at the nose without the mustache.

869
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,922
Oh, God. His eyes are...

870
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,657
Right?

871
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:30,313
Now, when I laid down the
photo of Yarberry earlier,

872
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:31,948
did he look familiar to you?

873
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,399
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

874
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:35,752
Big time.

875
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:37,954
Plus, the guy's a murder.
You said the guy was a mur...

876
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,455
Yeah, he is a murderer.

877
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,540
Died in his 30s.

878
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,959
He's 34 when he gets hung.

879
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,260
Now, I didn't mention this earlier

880
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,095
because I didn't think it was important.

881
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:48,531
But, um, you said the neck thing, right?

882
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:49,666
There was some kind of neck
pain that you were feeling?

883
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:50,667
Yes.

884
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,885
Well, he was hung by his neck, right?

885
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:55,071
Well, when they try to execute Yarberry,

886
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:57,373
it went terribly wrong.

887
00:38:57,459 --> 00:39:00,443
They try to kill him using a
method called the jerk method.

888
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,795
And what it was,
was a system of ropes and pulleys.

889
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:04,180
And it failed.

890
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:07,467
It wind up launching his
body into the wooden beam

891
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:09,485
above the gallows and crushed his head.

892
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:14,590
Now, the rope was pulled
so tightly around his neck

893
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:16,192
they couldn't get it off.

894
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,761
So they had to cut it but leave
the noose intact on his neck

895
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,163
and buried him that way.
Oh, wow.

896
00:39:20,248 --> 00:39:24,734
And he was hung just down the block here.

897
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,039
Well, Carla, now, we know why your kids

898
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,108
are so scared to be here alone.

899
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:35,695
But we haven't answered the big
question of can you stay here

900
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,764
and still carry on your family tradition

901
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,182
of having this restaurant

902
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:42,251
and one day turn it over to your kids?

903
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:44,837
Uh, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

904
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,709
So what I would like you to do

905
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:53,279
is get a medium who is
also a psychotherapist.

906
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:54,914
That's your best bet.

907
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:55,998
Okay.

908
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:59,035
So the first day, when this person comes,

909
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,288
I would like them to speak with her,

910
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:05,074
basically giving her a session

911
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,326
where she can talk about

912
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:08,778
everything that went on in her life

913
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,147
and kind of process it.

914
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,116
The second day, I would like the person

915
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:18,154
to come back and assist
in her being moved on.

916
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,007
The third day, this person will come.

917
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:24,360
And they will initially work
with the stabbing victim.

918
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:26,679
They'll be giving that person a talking-to

919
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:32,001
and then go ahead and move the murderer on.

920
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:33,603
And on the fourth day,

921
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:34,871
the person can come back

922
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:38,808
and do a cleansing of the
building and the residual,

923
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:42,779
um, paying specific attention to that,
uh, room.

924
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:47,350
As long as you do all of these steps,

925
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:50,319
it's a huge possibility that you'll be okay.

926
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:52,655
You look a lot happier
than when I first met you.

927
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm super relieved.

928
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:55,758
I entertained the thought

929
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,594
that maybe we were having a group delusion.

930
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:02,598
How do you feel now about
being able to tell your dad

931
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,717
that, "Hopefully,
I can do this for another 40 years"?

932
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:07,036
So relieved.

933
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,588
He built many things along the way.

934
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:10,339
But this is what remains.

935
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:11,958
And this is the part that I honor.

936
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:13,893
How does it feel to know that maybe,
one day,

937
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:15,945
that your grandson and granddaughter

938
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,364
may be running this place?

939
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,832
I would really love that.

940
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:23,452
I would feel complete in so many ways,
absolutely.

941
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:26,823
It won't be easy

942
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:29,008
removing the dead wreaking
havoc inside this restaurant.

943
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:32,144
But with the help of a
medium with special skills,

944
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,168
the evil here should be banished.

945
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:38,693
And Carla could keep the restaurant in
her family for generations to come.
