1
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,738
I feel like he comes up from the grave.

2
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:10,473
Tonight on
"Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:12,675
They look like little demons.

4
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:13,426
a second look

5
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,844
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,563
I heard it scared the out of you.

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,931
New information...

8
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:21,033
It feels like impending doom.

9
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,118
startling revelations.

10
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:25,687
We were living in the
house with these demons.

11
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,788
First...

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,824
I don't believe they were ever alive.

13
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:31,243
demons invade an Ohio home...

14
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:33,979
And it came right at me...
"Foof," right through me.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,081
Where hell unleashes a fury...

16
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:38,700
I thought I was just losing my mind.

17
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,253
that hungers for souls.

18
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,972
Those demons... they
can take your soul.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,073
Then...

20
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,092
He shot up from the ground.

21
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,661
this Pennsylvania
home is under attack...

22
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:50,863
"It doesn't matter where you are.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,997
I'll find you. I'll find you."

24
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,283
and the dead wage a war...

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,319
I see a black mist, and
it just goes "Whoosh."

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,422
while the
living fight for survival.

27
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,758
This entity haunts me.

28
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,661
Can these terrors be stopped...

29
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,496
It needs to end.

30
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,865
and innocent lives be saved?

31
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,688
Mighty Mother, let the
divine light descend!

32
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,658
Something bad's going to happen.

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,678
My name is Amy Allan.

34
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,046
There's panic.

35
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,480
And it's almost like a butchering.

36
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:26,598
I see dead people.

37
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,684
They all died horribly.

38
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:30,402
I speak to dead people.

39
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,787
Get out of here.

40
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,422
And they speak to me.

41
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,457
Vicious.

42
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,110
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

43
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,811
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

44
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:41,363
I rely on my partner.

45
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,015
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

46
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,883
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

47
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,618
This guy's a real piece of work.

48
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,155
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,773
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

50
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:52,941
It's my job to reveal them.

51
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,227
This is not good.

52
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,962
But Steve and I never speak...

53
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,997
We never communicate
during an investigation.

54
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:00,749
Until the very end...

55
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,217
I want my life back.

56
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:04,303
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

57
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:06,088
Is he trying to kill her?

58
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,356
Or time to get out.

59
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:08,874
My God.

60
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,676
This is going to kill us.

61
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,739
Some cases stick
with me more than others,

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,991
and the one we investigated
in Toledo, Ohio,

63
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,126
was a tough one for me to shake.

64
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:30,145
This family unit was being destroyed,

65
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,364
and one of the victims was a small child.

66
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,333
They turned to us for help and hope,

67
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:36,702
and I badly wanted to give them both.

68
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,423
We've had a couple of episodes

69
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:44,926
where we've been burned,
we've been scratched,

70
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,828
we've been pushed, we've been shoved.

71
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,181
I live in constant fear here.

72
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:50,432
Who do you live here with?

73
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:52,267
I live here with my partner, Leslie,

74
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:53,669
my daughter, Maggie,

75
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:56,955
and my 2-year-old
grandson, Nathan.

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,892
It seems like it got
worse after he was born.

77
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,145
- Is he being affected by this?
- He is.

78
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,547
We were sitting in the
living room, watching TV.

79
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,100
He was sitting on the
floor, playing with his toys,

80
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,936
and we seen him literally
lift up off the ground

81
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,438
and was shoved a good foot and a half.

82
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:19,978
As a grandma, I'd do anything
to protect my grandchild,

83
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:23,548
but a force that I
couldn't reckon with...

84
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,253
I knew that there was nothing
in my power that I could do,

85
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,205
and it was breaking my heart.

86
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:34,109
I fear greatly for him,

87
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,795
and I feel like we can't
protect him, either.

88
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,062
What the hell?

89
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,216
As soon as I stepped
through the front door,

90
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,619
I could tell this place was
filled with something evil.

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,988
It was clear to me whoever
lived here was at risk

92
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,891
and this walk was going
to be a very dangerous one.

93
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:10,545
There's a male here who
knows how it used to be

94
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,030
and is disturbed.

95
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,715
He's pissed.

96
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,872
The head pain is so bad.

97
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:29,281
There was an older
gentleman I seen in here,

98
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:31,033
wearing kind of like a suit.

99
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,468
Grayish hair.

100
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,687
He startles me at first, but
he doesn't seem threatening.

101
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,522
Okay, what time period
do you think he's from?

102
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:39,942
I would say early 1900s.

103
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,295
The fact that Angie
had seen this entity so clearly

104
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:46,499
she could actually pinpoint
the time period he was from

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,034
was extremely helpful to the investigation.

106
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,787
But what she described
next, I didn't see coming.

107
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,289
I seen one other one.

108
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,858
This one bothers me
'cause it really scared me.

109
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:02,214
It was a man, but he didn't look human.

110
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,466
He was in the mirror.

111
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:08,053
He had two horns off the top of his head.

112
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,189
Big teeth.

113
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:11,724
I would say at least 6 foot.

114
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:15,227
And I seen him kind of let out a growl,

115
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,215
and it came right at me...
"Foof," right through me,

116
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:22,551
and I immediately broke out into tears.

117
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:25,337
I've never been
afraid in my own home.

118
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,656
I thought I was just losing my mind.

119
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:30,309
I ran back to my room, woke up my partner,

120
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,978
and said, "Something's
going on around here,

121
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,531
and we need to get to the bottom of it."

122
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:37,883
I felt like I was gonna faint.
I was sick to my stomach.

123
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,419
- That had to scare the out of you.
- It did.

124
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:41,637
All I can tell you, Steve,

125
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:43,789
it was the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

126
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:47,276
I'm telling you, what
Angie described was horrifying.

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,577
But she wasn't alone.

128
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,480
This was another one of
those mind-blowing cases

129
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,550
where during her walk, Amy
saw the same exact thing,

130
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,585
in even more horrific detail.

131
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,207
There's something here.

132
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,376
And it came in through the front door.

133
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:11,650
These things, they look
like, little demons.

134
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,570
They kind of have, like, bat faces.

135
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:19,842
They have, like, pointed
ears, big eyes, sharp teeth.

136
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:23,679
Kind of centered on this female.

137
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,216
I was extremely worried
about Angie's well-being.

138
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,585
And talking to her teenage daughter

139
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:31,487
made me even more concerned.

140
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,780
- Now, this is your son's room.
- Yes.

141
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,166
Apparently, your mom
said she actually saw him

142
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,452
get picked up and kind of thrown or pushed.

143
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,354
Yeah. It has happened.

144
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,689
I felt like I
could tell Steve anything.

145
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,925
I really believed that
he was here to help us

146
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,259
and that it was his goal

147
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:56,562
to make sure he took care
of everything in the house

148
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,014
so everyone here would be
safe, especially Nathan.

149
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,466
He was playing in his room.

150
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,252
I was cleaning up, and I
heard him hit the ground,

151
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:06,538
and when I came into his
room, he was flat on his back,

152
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,440
and his face was bloodshot red.

153
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,175
I know his cries, and it was definitely

154
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,660
something I've never heard before.

155
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,813
This was... he wanted to get out of here.

156
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,149
Something scared him.

157
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:25,074
Those demons... they're
getting too out of hand.

158
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:28,510
That's what this older dude was saying.

159
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,946
This is the moment where I figured out

160
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,948
why the older man was so upset.

161
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,568
<i>These creatures were attacking
the living and the dead.</i>

162
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,872
And he says, "I can't handle that.

163
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:42,524
I can't get involved in that."

164
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,178
He can't fight anymore
because they're gonna get him.

165
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,379
They can take your soul.

166
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,888
Angie mentioned
that everyone in the house

167
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,356
had a paranormal experience,

168
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,291
so I was expecting more of the same

169
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,592
from her partner, Leslie.

170
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,778
But after talking to her, it became clear

171
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,615
that whatever was in that house
had a problem with religion.

172
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,034
My cross on my neck got ripped off

173
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,270
and thrown across the floor.

174
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,938
It was strange.

175
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,090
- Strange? It's a little bit scary.
- Yeah.

176
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,009
- Was anybody else home?
- No.

177
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:20,879
There's the battle

178
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,283
between the living and these things.

179
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,151
Do you know what these things are?

180
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,220
I don't believe they were ever alive.

181
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,739
They're kept out.

182
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,344
They can be kept at bay because
they respond to religion.

183
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:40,132
I guess you would call them,
like, some kind of demons.

184
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,366
Next...

185
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,470
She actually used
electroshock therapy on him.

186
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,472
Madness drives the dead...

187
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:49,007
This guy's sick for a long time.

188
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,943
to torture the living.

189
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,164
And in our second investigation...

190
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,915
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

191
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,785
A suburban home becomes a deathtrap.

192
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,153
You can't escape.

193
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,751
I never know what pulling the deed

194
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,686
to someone's property is gonna lead to.

195
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,438
In this case, I came to find out

196
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,990
the previous owner was
a bit of a local legend

197
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,142
before his life came to a tragic end.

198
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:25,546
I called on a retired detective
who knew all about this story.

199
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,093
Clarence Brown was
17 at the time in 1930.

200
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:43,113
And he got this idea
about counterfeiting bills.

201
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, was he operating out of
the house I'm investigating?

202
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,351
Yes, he did.

203
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,690
The older male,

204
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,343
I feel him very much
involved with the structure.

205
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:57,494
There was no denying

206
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:59,897
that those demons wanted
control of this house

207
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,565
and would do anything to get it.

208
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,285
But the older man I picked
up on in the living room

209
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,403
wasn't backing down from their threats.

210
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,889
Do you know anything about
what he was like in life?

211
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:13,310
I would say that he was a...

212
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,912
no bull kind of guy.

213
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:20,901
I would guess that he might
have been, like, a boss,

214
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,137
because he's very much
like, "This is what's goin'.

215
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,889
This is what we're doing
This is what's happening."

216
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,225
Who was all involved? Was
it just this guy Clarence?

217
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,493
Well, no.

218
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:32,346
Clarence and Sherman,
his dad, and his brother,

219
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,480
and two other associates.

220
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,965
Okay, so, he basically ran it.

221
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,467
Yes, he did.

222
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,870
I think he was also trying

223
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:44,091
to give warnings about what's going on.

224
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,213
Like, I see him talking to somebody,

225
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:53,334
trying to explain things to them.

226
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:58,138
Eventually, he got caught.
They were busted in 1935.

227
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:01,392
But when it came to trial,
according to this article here,

228
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,728
Clarence took the heat
for the entire family

229
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,281
and got a 3½-year sentence,

230
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,316
and he did about 2½ years.

231
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,886
Look, I can't condone
what this guy Clarence was doing,

232
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,072
but to take the rap for the whole thing

233
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,190
is a stand-up move.

234
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,758
Unfortunately, getting busted

235
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,960
was just the beginning of his troubles.

236
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,329
Okay, does he go back to
counterfeiting? What's he do?

237
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:23,964
No, he gave up the counterfeiting,

238
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,783
moved back into your client's house.

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,304
Things went real bad in 1948 initially,

240
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,939
when his mother died.

241
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,241
It hit him pretty hard.

242
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:38,602
***

243
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,033
This guy is sick.

244
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,418
Do you know how he died?

245
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,919
Something with his head.

246
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,824
He was developing a real paranoia.

247
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,578
He had pretty much
alienated his wife and sons.

248
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,649
He had a lot of pain in
his head. That's all I know.

249
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,950
It got so bad

250
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:03,737
that she actually used
electroshock therapy on him,

251
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,124
He was sick for a long time. I know that.

252
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:11,528
She eventually had him committed
to a mental institution,

253
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,248
where he spent the last
26 years of his life...

254
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,102
dying at age 83.

255
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,107
Coming up...

256
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,309
That's the thing that I see.

257
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,811
What happened after the investigation?

258
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,347
I order you,
by the Lord Jesus Christ,

259
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:31,882
to leave this home.

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,851
Exit immediately.

261
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,386
Do not return.

262
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:55,937
Amy, I'd like you to meet

263
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,923
the three ladies that live in this house.

264
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,141
The main reason we're here

265
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,227
is for Maggie's
2- year-old son, Nathan.

266
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,946
Aww.

267
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:08,083
My reveal with Amy and Steve
was extremely overwhelming.

268
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,952
Part of me was hoping that
she would find something

269
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:13,555
just so I didn't feel
like I was going crazy.

270
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,991
But another part of me was a little scared

271
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,526
of what she was gonna find.

272
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,494
I did meet an older male.

273
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:26,752
This individual has been trying
to warn you for some time.

274
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:30,772
He's been trying to communicate
to you through dreams.

275
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,241
- You told me about the old man, right?
- Right.

276
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:35,594
I often see him tinkering around.

277
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,063
We call him Clarence.

278
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,198
We don't know if that's his real name.

279
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,733
I started to have...

280
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:45,787
extreme pain in my head,

281
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,674
and I knew that it was coming from him.

282
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,776
Well, I'll tell you a story

283
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,944
about a guy that lived in this house.

284
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,846
His name was Clarence.

285
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,064
Really?

286
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:58,900
Clarence Brown.

287
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,452
My God.

288
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,104
You didn't know that?

289
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,072
Clarence, he decided, "You know what?

290
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,776
"I'm gonna start up a
counterfeiting business."

291
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,162
Right in the basement here,
they were printing up money.

292
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:13,765
So, it's 1935. The FBI busts him.

293
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,242
They arrested everybody...
his father, his brother.

294
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,170
<i>He said, "No, no. It was all on me.</i>

295
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,805
He took the hit,

296
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,274
So, he gets out of jail and
moves back into this house,

297
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,576
He starts getting mentally unstable.

298
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:26,862
His wife tried
everything...

299
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:30,015
in and out of doctors,
electroshock therapy.

300
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:35,587
1971, she had him committed
into a mental hospital.

301
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:39,241
He laid there for 26 years
till he died... in 1997.

302
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:46,047
That's him right there.

303
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,784
When Steve showed
me the picture of Clarence,

304
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:51,470
I knew right away that
was the guy I'd be seeg.

305
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,673
It was like, "My God, that's him."

306
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,057
It was crazy.

307
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,510
- So, you never knew the name Clarence?
- I didn't.

308
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,178
You're not bull me,
right? I'm not bull you.

309
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,296
Nowhere.

310
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:03,465
I'm blown away myself.

311
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:10,856
The older man was telling
me that he had been fighting,

312
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,026
for quite some time, a particular entity,

313
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,678
but now there's more,

314
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:20,031
and he can't contend with them any further.

315
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,467
They're very strange-looking.

316
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:26,471
They have bat faces. They
have the pointed ears.

317
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,574
I do not think that these
things were ever alive.

318
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:32,611
I think they're inherently evil.

319
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:37,299
One thing I noticed was someone was saying

320
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,801
some type of religious statement,

321
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:44,072
<i>and it did make them
back... back up.</i>

322
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,642
I would say that these things
are some kind of demons.

323
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,445
It made me sick to my stomach,

324
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:54,583
knowing that we were living
in the house with these demons.

325
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:57,886
Also, the closet where I
saw most of these things

326
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,755
was in the smaller room upstairs.

327
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,107
That's my son's room.

328
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:05,827
Is it possible that he's seen them?

329
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:07,312
Yes.

330
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:10,749
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

331
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:18,790
Geez.

332
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:21,309
That's the thing that I see.

333
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,464
It's all right, baby.

334
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,285
When I seen that
sketch, it really upset me.

335
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:48,854
There's just been a lot of times

336
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,022
where Nathan has woken
up crying in his room,

337
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,124
and I always just linked
them to bad dreams.

338
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:55,844
Now I feel like it was
probably something more.

339
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:58,563
All the things that
have happened to your son,

340
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:01,032
that would have been from these things?

341
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,217
Yes.

342
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,388
What do we do?
That's what we need to know.

343
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:07,656
What do we do?

344
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:12,060
The first thing that needs
to be done immediately

345
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:17,916
is the contact of a
priest or a demonologist...

346
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:21,870
someone who can perform an exorcism

347
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:25,206
on the home and the property

348
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:31,263
that is just to be directed
towards the demonic entities.

349
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,683
You gonna go through that?

350
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,696
After the investigation,

351
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,131
the activity around here really amped up.

352
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:53,218
It just seemed to get crazy around here.

353
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,587
The footsteps
got way more frequent.

354
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,005
The banging got way louder.

355
00:17:57,106 --> 00:18:00,342
I felt like I was locking myself
in my room almost every night.

356
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,948
Heavenly Father,
I ask that you can place

357
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,668
a hedge of protection around this home

358
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,771
to keep out any evil spirits that are here.

359
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,323
We took Amy's advice
and found a demonologist

360
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,425
to come into our home and do an exorcism.

361
00:18:17,526 --> 00:18:20,261
Heavenly Father,

362
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:25,183
we ask for a hedge of
protection upon this home.

363
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:28,837
Humbly ask this in Jesus' name.

364
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,707
The demonologist went through
the house with anointing oil,

365
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,609
and he performed an exorcism

366
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,896
on each and every room, window, and door.

367
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:43,818
I now renounce
all past use of this property

368
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:47,872
for false religions, occult practices,

369
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,025
spiritualistic healings, and such.

370
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,292
The next thing he did

371
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,795
was he went around with an incense burner,

372
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:55,697
putting up a wall of protection

373
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:57,999
against anything evil
that was remaining here.

374
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,801
Any demonic spirits,

375
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,288
any evil spirts that may
be inhabiting this home,

376
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:07,175
I order you, by the Lord Jesus Christ,

377
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,144
to leave this home.

378
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,979
Exit immediately.

379
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,497
Do not return.

380
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,266
Heavenly Father,

381
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:19,337
I ask for your guidance and
your protection upon Angie

382
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:23,541
and that you can deliver her from all evil.

383
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,360
In Jesus' name.

384
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:28,797
And after that,
he blessed all four of us,

385
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,266
and he blessed the home, as well.

386
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,869
Heavenly Father, I ask that
you can bless this home.

387
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,821
Deliver them from evil.

388
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,157
In Jesus' name.

389
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,308
Amen.

390
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,052
I definitely
feel like the demonologist

391
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,454
get rid of the demonic
entities that were here.

392
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,525
Soon after the priest left,

393
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,477
I really noticed a big difference.

394
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,312
The home was peaceful.

395
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,181
For once, in eight or nine years,

396
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,350
it was actually peaceful.

397
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,927
Demons are one of
the most difficult entities

398
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,328
to get rid of,

399
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,398
but I'm confident that the steps
Maggie and her family have taken

400
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,682
will keep the evil out

401
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,669
and make their home a
safer place to raise Nathan.

402
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:36,117
The case we looked
into in Hanover, Pennsylvania,

403
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,569
was really troubling for me.

404
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,771
We had a woman being physically assaulted

405
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,122
by something in her house.

406
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:42,857
Needless to say, I'm outraged

407
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,543
when I hear about a woman
being physically attacked,

408
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,512
and by the end of our investigation,

409
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,298
it was clear that Amy and
I got there just in time.

410
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,286
I want my home back.

411
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,656
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

412
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,674
What's going on?

413
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,978
I'm seeing apparitions.
I'm seeing shadow figures.

414
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,197
I'm being bit, scratched.

415
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,148
Geez.

416
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,383
How long you living here?

417
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,851
Seven years.

418
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,017
Okay, and you live
here with your husband.

419
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:11,444
Yes... Tom.

420
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,488
Okay, so, seven years
this has being going on,

421
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:15,273
or has it progressively gotten worse?

422
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,509
It has progressively gotten worse.

423
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:20,412
Tom and I are
attacked daily in our home.

424
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:21,713
It's nonstop.

425
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,232
I could be just sitting
here, and all of a sudden,

426
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,434
I'm just feeling this encroachment.

427
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:30,355
Like, you can feel them coming.
It feels like impending doom.

428
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,489
I've got to the point

429
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,241
where I won't even sleep upstairs anymore.

430
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,876
I don't even sleep with my own husband.

431
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,378
Where are you sleeping?

432
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,613
I'm sleeping in the spare bedroom.

433
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:40,448
Is it easier for you to sleep there?

434
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,000
No. I have no safe haven.

435
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,053
No matter where I go in this
house, I can't find relief.

436
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:59,829
This case pose some
real challenges for me

437
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,565
From the moment I stepped
foot on this property,

438
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,334
it was clear there was an entity

439
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,753
that was extremely hostile towards women.

440
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,772
I had a strong feeling
it would come after me.

441
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,774
There's something here.

442
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:15,411
But I don't know what it is.

443
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:22,151
Overwhelming panic, overwhelming fear,

444
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,636
and got to get away.

445
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,104
This is a living woman?

446
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,573
Yes.

447
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:29,042
Moving from room to room to room to room.

448
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:31,728
And the thing...
this thing's saying,

449
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:34,380
"You're mine. You can't escape."

450
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:41,621
And I hear a deep male voice.

451
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,107
I feel like he
comes up from the grave.

452
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,510
He was alive. He was a living person once.

453
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,514
This is...
it's very creepy.

454
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:55,218
It's very... this
is creepy.

455
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,722
This shadow man... he
shot up from the ground.

456
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,017
***

457
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,818
evil strikes.

458
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,670
He holds her down,

459
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:10,756
and he's telling her, "I've got you."

460
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,564
As Deanna led me from room to room,

461
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,883
it was obvious there
was no place in her house

462
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,050
where she felt safe.

463
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:29,953
But what was going on in her spare bedroom

464
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:31,655
was even more disturbing.

465
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:34,591
As I was asleep, I just felt this stroking.

466
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:36,210
And then, when I opened my eyes to look,

467
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:40,881
there was this woman in
period dress, late 1800s.

468
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:42,966
So, if you saw a sketch or a photo of her,

469
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,201
would you recognize her?

470
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,302
- Yes.
- Okay.

471
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:47,254
- Anything else going on in here?
- Yes.

472
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,790
When I wake up,

473
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:53,126
this is what I have on me
in the middle of my back.

474
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,231
Is there anything else that
you are experiencing here?

475
00:23:57,315 --> 00:24:00,017
Yes, I have this one particular dream

476
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:01,868
that just keeps reoccurring.

477
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:03,670
This shadow
man...

478
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:07,224
he shot up from the ground, just "Pfoom!"

479
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:10,594
And then I opened my eyes,
like, "Deanna, it's a dream.

480
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:13,430
"Get out of this. It's a dream. Wake up."

481
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:14,648
And when I woke up,

482
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:17,768
he was standing at the side of the bed,

483
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:19,052
looking at me.

484
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:24,324
Seeing this entity
is the worst experience

485
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,843
that I've had in
this household...

486
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,062
the one that haunts me in my sleep.

487
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,882
He was about 7 foot tall, red eyes.

488
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,084
He had, like, a hat.

489
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:37,337
And as soon as you saw
him, you know it's evil.

490
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:44,244
She thinks they're
dreams, but they're not dreams.

491
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:46,680
She's awake.

492
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:50,450
He holds her down, and he's telling her,

493
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:53,303
"I smell you. I taste you. I've got you."

494
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,672
He comes to the side of the bed.

495
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:59,376
He's always, like, over
her, hovering over her.

496
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:02,296
He manipulates how he's seen.

497
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,333
He has a hat
A black hat.

498
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:09,052
It's giving me chills down my back.

499
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,389
But it really is very disturbing.

500
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:22,432
I was coming up the steps,

501
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,735
and then I felt two hands just, like that.

502
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,036
- So that hard?
- That hard.

503
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,005
I was shoved.

504
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:34,011
I believe that there
was an evil entity present

505
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:36,013
that pushed me down the steps.

506
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,216
There's nothing you can
do to protect yourself.

507
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,268
There's just nothing you can do.

508
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,486
You must be frightened

509
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:44,504
every time you got to
come up these stairs, then.

510
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:45,722
Yeah.

511
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,627
It feels like somebody's
literally going like,

512
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,946
"You're not coming up here.

513
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,364
No, you don't."

514
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,251
Like, I just feel that coming
down the stairs towards me.

515
00:26:01,756 --> 00:26:03,240
What I felt on the stairwell

516
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:06,526
was one of the more powerful
forces I've ever encountered.

517
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:09,796
It clearly did not want me
entering that upstairs bedroom.

518
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,933
And once I stepped
inside, I understood why.

519
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,369
It's almost like a seducing,

520
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:18,155
like, soothing.

521
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:22,826
And he can destroy you.

522
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,396
Having spoken with Deanna,

523
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,116
I couldn't wait to hear what
her husband, Tom, had to say.

524
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,701
This guy's a pharmacist, but
what came out of his mouth

525
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,403
was not what you'd expect to hear

526
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,589
from someone who has a
scientific background.

527
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,191
Are you a skeptic at all?

528
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:42,212
Certain things, I can't find
a reason for or an answer for.

529
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,297
I have physically seen

530
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:47,701
scratches on Deanna's
back that I cannot explain

531
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:49,403
and some bruises on her.

532
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:51,571
As the man of the house, you
do feel kind of powerless,

533
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,857
'cause you don't know
what you are up against.

534
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,576
It's not like you can just
call 911 and take care of it,

535
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:58,728
'cause you don't know
what you're dealing with.

536
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,847
Okay, but you've had some
experiences, is that right?

537
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,149
Yes.

538
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,551
<i>I hear footsteps. I don't see anything.</i>

539
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:06,069
Where'd you hear the footsteps?

540
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,138
It sounded like they
were walking on the roof

541
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,523
when we were in the bedroom.

542
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:11,024
And when we're in the family room,

543
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,110
it sounds like they're going
up and down the steps here

544
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:14,878
to the basement and to the bedroom.

545
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,997
Do you ever think somebody's
breaking into the house?

546
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:19,399
I don't think that, 'cause
I do have a security system.

547
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:26,356
I hate it down here.

548
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:28,525
I hate it.

549
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,660
It's a short man.

550
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,395
He's angry, this one.

551
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,164
He's, like, always angry.

552
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:35,649
I feel like he's gonna attack me,

553
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,884
like he's gonna beat the out of me.

554
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,956
Deanna and I were
sitting at the kitchen table,

555
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,542
and it wasn't long, I said,
"Hey, I feel a burn on my arm."

556
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,994
And I had a long-sleeve shirt
on, rolled up the sleeve,

557
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:50,080
and I had a single scratch mark across it.

558
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:52,516
And coming out, like, right in this area,

559
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,802
there was, like, a black
mist coming out of the wall.

560
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,043
What is this thing?

561
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:07,097
I see a black mist.

562
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:10,617
This is the angry guy from the basement,

563
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:13,286
And it just goes "Whoosh" at the person.

564
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:16,790
He has hostility toward women.

565
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:18,909
Yep.

566
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,462
I feel like he's capable
of harming someone.

567
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,082
Next...

568
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,217
He was pretty ruthless.

569
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,669
An entity hungers for victims.

570
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,272
He hates them. He hates them.

571
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,679
At this point, our investigation

572
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:48,131
read like something in
the police blotter...

573
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:50,367
"Woman attacked in her
sleep, assailant unknown."

574
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:51,785
I needed more.

575
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,271
I started digging into the
history of Deanna's property,

576
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:57,040
and I found out it was
once owned by a violent man,

577
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:58,875
who settled disputes with a gun.

578
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,438
The original settler
was a man named John Digges.

579
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,474
He was granted 10,000 acres of land.

580
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,695
This whole 10,000 acres
was called Digges' Choice.

581
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:21,665
Where on this map would
my clients' house be?

582
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:24,084
Right here.

583
00:29:24,168 --> 00:29:25,585
Okay.

584
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,622
He had a fairly sizable
plantation that he farmed,

585
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:31,174
but he also wanted to
sell the rest of the land

586
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:33,460
and make as much money
as he could off of it.

587
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:36,430
The problem was, there were other settlers

588
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:40,067
that were coming in along
the edges of this property

589
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,169
instead of buying land from him.

590
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,754
He didn't like that very much.

591
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:48,575
He and his sons would go out with guns

592
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:49,860
- and try to run them off.
- Wow.

593
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:54,281
He was pretty ruthless
with the way he enforced it.

594
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:04,241
I'm seeing this guy when he was alive.

595
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:08,111
Older man.

596
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:13,967
He had this power to
control their destinies,

597
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:16,503
and that's what he's still doing.

598
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,605
My...

599
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,991
And he says, "I can smell it.

600
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,477
I can smell it, and I can taste it on him."

601
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,312
Smell what?

602
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,513
Fear.

603
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,299
He hates them. He hates them.

604
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,840
So, I found evidence
of a ruthless landowner

605
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,726
who would shoot first
and ask questions later.

606
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:41,595
And if that weren't bad enough,

607
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:43,697
I also found out about
a woman named Lydia Small

608
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:44,731
who once lived there,

609
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:48,084
and she lost four kids to drownings.

610
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,120
This place was a deathtrap.

611
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:58,695
The drownings of her
four children were just the start.

612
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,515
In 1907, she had a son.

613
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:02,883
His name was John Jacob,

614
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:06,269
and he died of what was at
the time called convulsions.

615
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,522
And then sadly, shortly thereafter,

616
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:10,490
she lost her husband, as well.

617
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:12,776
So now, after all this
tragedy with this woman,

618
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,427
what ended up happening to her?

619
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:19,482
Well, on April 18th of 1939,
Lydia herself passed away.

620
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,219
She just wore out after
dealing with the loss

621
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:25,372
and the hardship that she'd
suffered all those years.

622
00:31:25,456 --> 00:31:27,791
Her body just eventually gave out.

623
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:31,928
There's a woman that's,
like, really losing it,

624
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,897
like, losing her

625
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:37,100
She's just always, like, crying.

626
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:38,985
And then I see a casket coming out.

627
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:41,104
And then I see this woman...

628
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:43,440
Just a mess.

629
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,542
I picked up on a woman

630
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:48,228
who suffered loss after loss after loss.

631
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,230
She was just surrounded by death.

632
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,565
It might explain

633
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:54,568
why this property felt
like it was one giant grave,

634
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:57,454
just waiting to bury its next victim.

635
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,713
I think there's a lot
of things that happened

636
00:32:06,814 --> 00:32:08,748
one right after the other here.

637
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,234
I think she gets sick.

638
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:15,505
She wastes away, but I don't know

639
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:18,441
if that's, like, from her emotional loss,

640
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:22,395
because I feel this extreme anger

641
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,547
and this extreme sadness.

642
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:27,567
Next...

643
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:32,822
This house is extremely unsafe for women.

644
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:34,391
The shocking reveal.

645
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:37,127
He just came up with such a force

646
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:38,478
and just went "Vroom!"

647
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,730
clients confront their demons.

648
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:41,998
Is he trying to kill her?

649
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,416
Yes.

650
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:47,087
Who will prevail
... The living or the dead?

651
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:50,507
Let the divine light descend!

652
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:12,771
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Deanna and Tom.

653
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:14,806
They've been living
through hell, basically.

654
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,059
In the last few years,
it's gotten real physical.

655
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:20,312
My heart was just racing,
my hands are sweating.

656
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,565
I'm thinking, "My
gosh. It's finally here."

657
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,635
So I was very nervous and very apprehensive

658
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:29,521
about meeting Amy and
what she was gonna tell us.

659
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:31,607
One of the things that I got

660
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:34,610
was dead women who were suffering.

661
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:36,745
But the one that stood out the most to me

662
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:39,298
was freaking out, crying.

663
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:41,033
And then the door opened,

664
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,869
and a casket came out of the front door.

665
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,472
Whoever that person was who died,

666
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,074
it was extremely sudden.

667
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:52,110
In the end, she became sick

668
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:55,881
from not dealing with this death.

669
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,133
Now, you see a woman, right?

670
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,167
Yes.

671
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:02,571
This woman is, just like you said,

672
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:05,357
very sickly.

673
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,292
So, do you think this is the woman you saw?

674
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:10,195
I don't know, but I did do a sketch.

675
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,517
Wow.

676
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,653
That's her.

677
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:22,491
That's who I see.

678
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:32,034
It's overwhelming for
me that Amy saw this woman.

679
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:34,920
But to have somebody see what I saw,

680
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,788
it makes me feel better,

681
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,609
that it's not in my head, that it's real.

682
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:43,545
There was a woman that
lived on your property line.

683
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,530
Her name was Lydia Small.

684
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:50,802
This is a stack of articles
regarding her loss in life.

685
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:51,887
She lived here?

686
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:53,672
She lived on the property line.

687
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,591
Turns out, she lost four
children to drowning accidents,

688
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,427
three of them in the same quarry.

689
00:34:58,511 --> 00:34:59,878
My gosh.

690
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:01,730
It was amazing.

691
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:05,300
Steve validated everything
Amy said about Lydia Small.

692
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:08,737
Now, the whole tragedy with
Lydia and what she went through,

693
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:11,189
I think the whole thing
just took a toll on her

694
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:13,975
and her body just
deteriorated down to nothing.

695
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,177
It's pretty sad.

696
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:17,946
Anything else go on?

697
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,900
There's this individual I met
on the first floor... a male...

698
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:24,386
and I was scared.

699
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:27,139
He really hates women.

700
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:32,027
And when I started going
up to the room upstairs,

701
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:34,246
I felt someone pushing me back,

702
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:38,467
being like, "No, you
are not coming up here."

703
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,736
Well, that's one of the
big reasons we're here.

704
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,904
Deanna, tell Amy what happened to you.

705
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,323
One night, I was going
up the steps to go to bed,

706
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:47,876
and he just came up with such a force,

707
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,312
and just went "Vroom!" Wow.

708
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:53,532
She actually moved into
the downstairs bedroom...

709
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:55,767
Yes...'cause she's afraid
to go upstairs and go to sleep.

710
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:56,768
Really?

711
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,720
Because I did see a woman

712
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:01,440
who was going from bedroom to bedroom,

713
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,775
trying to get away from him,

714
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,012
and one of the things that
I heard him saying to her

715
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:11,650
was, "I've got you. You're
mine. There's no escape."

716
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,954
In that bedroom, I was having a dream,

717
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,039
And then, when I opened up my eyes,

718
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,308
he's standing right there.

719
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:24,663
And he told me that nobody
can help me now... I was his.

720
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:29,351
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

721
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,127
Amy, that's him.

722
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,832
That's him.

723
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,385
My God, Tom.

724
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:49,504
That's the man I told you about.

725
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:53,375
I just felt
like I couldn't breathe.

726
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:56,178
It was very bad.

727
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,979
It's just horrible.

728
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:01,099
But she got it just right.

729
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,285
Now, she wakes up in the morning,

730
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,203
she's got bruises, scratches.

731
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:09,691
Wow.

732
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,344
Now, is this thing capable of causing this?

733
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:13,778
Sure. Yes. Yes.

734
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:16,598
Do you know anything about
him or who he might be or...

735
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:19,851
Yeah. He was absolutely
in a power position.

736
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:22,954
He did terrible things throughout his life.

737
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,956
He is attached to the property.

738
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:27,909
The original guy that
owned the place...

739
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,027
his name was John Digges.

740
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:32,731
So, he was a powerful guy and ruthless,

741
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:35,000
you know, in the way he did his business.

742
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,269
<i>Yeah, that is interesting. Okay.</i>

743
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:40,021
So, what does he want?

744
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:44,776
His one main goal is to
go after the women here.

745
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:46,478
Is he trying to kill her?

746
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,431
Yes.

747
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:56,321
When Amy told me that
this house is unsafe for women,

748
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:57,722
I was overwhelmed.

749
00:37:57,823 --> 00:37:59,291
How do you stop this?

750
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:01,927
<i>What do I got to do? What can I do?</i>

751
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:04,162
Because it needs to end.

752
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:07,349
A male witch who's also a medium

753
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:09,484
needs to be called in here.

754
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:13,872
And he needs to call all
of the dead women to him.

755
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:21,112
And then he is going to
summon the evil dead male.

756
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:23,465
You cannot be here.

757
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:28,770
They are going to put him
where he needs to be forever,

758
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:32,240
where he can do no more
harm to anyone ever again.

759
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:34,576
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

760
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:50,025
Ever since Amy and Steve have left,

761
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:54,329
the activity here has been off the charts.

762
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,181
It's just been horrible.

763
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:58,433
And I think it knows what it's up against,

764
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,784
and it doesn't want that,

765
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,120
and it's been taking it out on Tom and I.

766
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,767
Deanna and I took Amy's advice

767
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,119
and found a local male witch medium

768
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:20,455
and to have him come into the house

769
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:24,009
and cleanse it, go through the ritual.

770
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:26,144
And Deanna and I could not be present.

771
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:34,970
He started at the
top floor of the house

772
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:37,989
and cleansed each room
with sage and frankincense.

773
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,502
The purpose of the ritual

774
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,971
was to push all the entities into one room,

775
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,456
which was the living room,

776
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,624
and that's where he set up his altar,

777
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,794
so he could deal with the
evil entities in that one spot.

778
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:02,831
I call now upon the spirits of this house.

779
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,784
Those who wish to leave and
move on to the other side,

780
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:09,421
move into the light and into
the arms of those who love you.

781
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:13,108
He gave the entities a
chance to go out on their own,

782
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:16,111
and the ones that
did not choose that...

783
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,613
he sent them out with his ritual.

784
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:22,567
For about me flames the pentagram.

785
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:27,956
Within me shines the six-rayed star.

786
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,426
Above me, the glory of God.

787
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,877
The supreme banishing ritual

788
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:36,831
puts a giant star at
each of the four corners,

789
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:39,384
which is set to protect the house.

790
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:44,172
Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother,
Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer.

791
00:40:45,524 --> 00:40:48,259
In addition to that, it actually
summons the four archangels

792
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:50,612
to watch over the house, as well.

793
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:53,648
Let the divine light descend!

794
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:04,042
This temple is duly closed.

795
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:12,167
After the male witch medium left,

796
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:15,887
I do notice that in my own
bedroom, where I was attacked,

797
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:20,275
that room used to be ice-cold,
and it felt so much better,

798
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:24,813
and that one particular
room felt a lot warmer.

799
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:28,650
Our hope is that we can not live in fear,

800
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,485
that we can be at peace,

801
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:34,189
that we can just have a
home like everybody else,

802
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,174
and go on with our lives.

803
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,030
Deanna and Tom made a good choice

804
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:44,666
by bringing in a strong,
masculine witch medium.

805
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,085
The fact that they are already experiencing

806
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:50,088
a change in their home is a
good sign the ritual worked.

807
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,090
I believe if they remain vigilant,

808
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,442
they should be able to stay in their home

809
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,561
and live in peace and tranquility.
