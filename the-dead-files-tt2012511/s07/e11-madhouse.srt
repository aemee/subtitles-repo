1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,695
I hear, "Mad house."
That's creepy.

2
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,397
It's terrifying.

3
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:17,999
I wouldn't come down here alone.

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,467
It feels like I'm being punched.

5
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,168
Two red marks on my arm.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,271
He got shot?

7
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,740
It does not have a happy ending.

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:29,543
The energy is anxious, angry.

9
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:33,347
This is seriously the worst place to be.

10
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,916
Something bad's going to happen.

11
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,653
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:39,820
There's panic.

13
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,888
And it's almost like a butchering.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,423
I see dead people.

15
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,692
They all died horribly.

16
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,193
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,495
Get out of here.

18
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:48,963
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,765
Vicious.

20
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,868
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,703
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,138
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,406
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:01,008
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,510
This guy's a real piece of work.

26
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,780
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:07,081
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

28
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:09,050
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,584
This is not good.

30
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,353
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,455
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,424
until the very end...

33
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:17,792
I want my life back.

34
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,860
when we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,429
Is he trying to kill her?

36
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,697
or time to get out.

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,231
Oh, my God.

38
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,067
This is going to kill us.

39
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,115
I'm out here in Marshall, Missouri.

40
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,185
It's about 90 miles east of Kansas City.

41
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,419
I got a call from a woman

42
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,923
who saved the small
city's only movie theater.

43
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,441
Now, here's the problem.

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,293
She believes something
there is not happy about it

45
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,595
and wants her out.

46
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,131
She's so scared for her staff and family,

47
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,050
she's agreed to close
the theater for a few days

48
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,534
during our investigation.

49
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:01,802
She said if we can't help her,

50
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,971
she might have to walk
away and shut the doors.

51
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,795
Before Amy arrives, it's important

52
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,282
that I clear the area of
any leading information.

53
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,868
I can't hide that this is a movie theater,

54
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,053
but I still need to cover anything

55
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:22,223
that might distract her during her walk.

56
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:26,160
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight.

57
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:39,356
There's a lot of dead
people that come around.

58
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,927
And I feel like they're sick or crazy.

59
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,914
And I hear, "Mad house."

60
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,419
[Bleep] me.

61
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,720
Ugh.

62
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:57,258
There's a lot of competition
here between the dead,

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,960
competing for attention.

64
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,400
And... and, like,
for some reason,

65
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,869
they don't like each other.

66
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm hearing, "This is
where the dead throw down."

67
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,248
Well, Kim, this is a really

68
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,883
quaint-looking place you've got here.

69
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,885
But when you were on the
phone with me, it just...

70
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,420
you sounded really desperate.

71
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:27,655
What's going on?

72
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,524
We purchased the theater four years ago.

73
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,792
- Okay.
- There was an ad in the paper

74
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:35,129
that said it was going
to be, uh, shut down.

75
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,398
Marshall is a small town.

76
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,434
And, like many towns, it
it has been struggling.

77
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:41,969
A lot of stuff is closed down here.

78
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,738
Yes.

79
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:47,942
It would be a very big blow to Marshall

80
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,343
to not have a movie theater.

81
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:51,412
It would be like turning
off that last light.

82
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,247
But why do you got to
be the responsible one?

83
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:54,532
I grew up in Marshall.

84
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,584
I came to this movie theater as a child.

85
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,085
I raised my kids here.

86
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,153
So, you want to preserve that?

87
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,454
Yes.

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,109
This is the theater when it was really old.

89
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,610
Doesn't even have the marquee out front,

90
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:07,828
right? Nope.

91
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,130
So what exactly is everybody experiencing?

92
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:13,133
Noises that just can't be explained.

93
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,305
Laughter, voice mimicry,
things being moved.

94
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:20,608
Several people have been touched.

95
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,677
A couple people have
actually seen shadow figures.

96
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,778
Okay.

97
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,146
How many people do you have on staff?

98
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,248
Um, 15.

99
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,984
And a lot of those are my family.

100
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,454
Uh, actually, I have a picture.

101
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,589
My son, Damon, he's 22.

102
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,491
My daughter, Allie, is 23.

103
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:41,061
And my dad, he just turned 64.

104
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:44,381
- I'm worried about my dad.
- Why?

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,918
I feel like it's really
narrowing in on him.

106
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:52,306
It's definitely created a
lot of anxiety and tension.

107
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,475
I'm afraid for what's next.

108
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,262
I want my staff and my family
to feel that they're safe.

109
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,915
And I want people to know
that the theater will...

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,183
will always be here.

111
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,857
That's creepy [bleep].

112
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,359
There's a lot of people here.

113
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,944
Any idea how many?

114
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,732
I feel like I met the whole town.

115
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,636
A lot of the dead people
here go in your body.

116
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:26,173
If they're jumped by those people,

117
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,275
they might change.

118
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:29,476
How?

119
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,812
I think people could get really depressed,

120
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,348
suddenly violently ill.

121
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,954
Oh, my God.

122
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,441
What?

123
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,694
I just don't think it's
gonna be good down there,

124
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,796
'cause, like, all the [bleep] people.

125
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,209
Okay. So why'd you bring me down here?

126
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:05,429
I feel just a sense of unease, anxiety,

127
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,381
like I'm being watched.

128
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,850
Nobody wants to come
down here, to be honest.

129
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,834
So, it's that bad down here?

130
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,952
Yes.

131
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,537
Anything else happening to you down here?

132
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,055
I hear a lot of noises.

133
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:18,926
It sounds like somebody's,
like, banging around on things.

134
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,828
I mean, you've got pipes.
You've got wood walls.

135
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,730
You've got concrete floors. I mean...

136
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,265
It's not the kind of
clanking that you would hear

137
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,568
with a furnace shutting off or on.

138
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,471
It's almost like it
wants to get my attention.

139
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,438
Now, you're sure these noises

140
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,523
aren't coming from a staff member?

141
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,174
Whenever I've heard these noises,

142
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:35,876
I knew I was alone in the building.

143
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,661
Wow. What do you think is here?

144
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,815
That's what I'm really hoping
to find out, um, with your help.

145
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,026
I don't think the living would
have good experiences down here.

146
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,194
There's a lot of death here.

147
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,096
I feel a lot of hustle and bustle.

148
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,566
A lot of bad people,
in and out, in and out.

149
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,406
I feel like my head gets beat.

150
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,975
I feel, like, impacts to my head.

151
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,366
The people here...

152
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:17,985
I don't know why they're here.

153
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:21,288
They're yelling and screaming.

154
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,190
They're sick... sick.

155
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,993
So much oppression.

156
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,761
Oppression.

157
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,104
So, Amber, I was talking to Kimmy.

158
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,423
She told me you're one of
the oldest employees here.

159
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,407
Yes, that's correct.

160
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,076
How long you been working here?

161
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,844
- Um, 18 years.
- Okay.

162
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,613
Have you had experiences
along those 18 years?

163
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,198
Yes, I've had several.

164
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:52,519
The most recent one is, I was pinched.

165
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,923
I was downstairs in the concession stand,

166
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,058
and I felt a pinch on my arm.

167
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,893
And I looked down,

168
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,696
and I had two red marks on my arm.

169
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,631
Did you feel like it
was fingers or something?

170
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,251
It felt like a person pinching, yes.

171
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,319
Wow. Anything else go on?

172
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,756
We were starting up a movie up here,

173
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:17,544
and on the screen there was,
like, the silhouette of a man.

174
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,949
I could tell that he was tall and thin

175
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,251
- and he had, like, broad shoulders.
- Okay.

176
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,419
Could it have been
somebody behind the curtain?

177
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:26,670
No.

178
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,356
I don't even think you
can get behind this screen.

179
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,258
Um, the only way

180
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,660
would be to stand in front of the window...

181
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,713
- Okay.
- ... Up there.

182
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:37,831
So, was anybody in the room with you?

183
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,234
No. I was there by myself.

184
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,936
Was there something
wrong with the film? No.

185
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,705
We played a later showing of it

186
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,207
and, when I turned it
on for the next showing,

187
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,509
it was fine.

188
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,411
Wow. Okay.

189
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:03,157
This is, seriously, the worst place to be.

190
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,627
Living people up here
would see a lot of [bleep].

191
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:10,731
Um...

192
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,132
Uh...

193
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,338
Shadow people.

194
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,541
You can see them in the seats...

195
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,430
swooping all over the place.

196
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:29,917
It's, like, chaotic up here.

197
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,853
The energy is, uh, bad.

198
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,455
Anxious. Angry.

199
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,457
I feel very sick.

200
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,302
So, Paul, I was talking
to your daughter Kimberly.

201
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,404
And, um, she's really worried about you.

202
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:12,307
She thinks that whatever's
here is actually targeting you,

203
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:14,276
picking on you.

204
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:15,944
Do you agree with that?

205
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,030
- I'm beginning to.
- You are?

206
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,183
It's... the activity is
getting a little more personal.

207
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,169
I feel like I'm sharing this building

208
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,989
with a being that's not human.

209
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,224
I'm not sure that I'm the
one that brought this here

210
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,561
or there's just something
about me that makes me

211
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,063
- vulnerable to these things.
- Why?

212
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,201
Have you ever had experiences
before the theater here?

213
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:41,737
- Yes.
- You have?

214
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:42,788
Where was that?

215
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:46,241
This was at a house in Kansas City.

216
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:49,678
From the time I was 16 until I was 23,

217
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,346
the house was very active.

218
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:55,884
What scares me the most is
that they may have returned.

219
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,353
I may have brought them from Kansas City

220
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,056
and they're just showing up now.

221
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:05,861
But I'm afraid that my
daughter or her staff

222
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:09,881
may end up experiencing some
of the things that I have.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,467
And I can't...

224
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:15,103
that's something I
couldn't even apologize for.

225
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,173
So tell me about a few
things that happened to you.

226
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:23,278
I heard a girl, a young girl, laughing.

227
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,314
I looked up and down and around.

228
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,317
I thought, if I can find the source

229
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,786
or the direction it's coming from,

230
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,321
then I can investigate that area.

231
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,289
But it didn't work.

232
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,390
Was anybody here?

233
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:36,825
I was the only one here.

234
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:37,943
Anything else?

235
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:42,097
I was toward the back of the theater, uh,

236
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:45,567
and heard an extremely loud boom.

237
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:49,671
I describe it as somebody
dropping a bowling ball

238
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,107
on a wood floor from 25 or 30 feet.

239
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,208
- That loud?
- Yeah.

240
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,710
I didn't know what to think.

241
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,945
Now, is it possible that
it was a loop from a movie

242
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:57,813
that was playing here?

243
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,881
No movies were showing.

244
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:03,518
Projectors were shut down
and I was the only one here.

245
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:09,391
There's, like, this woman who is there.

246
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:10,659
She's all dressed in black.

247
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,028
This woman is dressed in black.

248
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,364
I've never experienced anything like this.

249
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,899
Every time I turn around,
I see another dead person.

250
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:21,370
And just about all of them are angry.

251
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:24,439
She is, like, in... in here.

252
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,541
She really, um,

253
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:33,048
doesn't care for, um,
many of the people here.

254
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,517
They bother her often.

255
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:39,888
Then she gets angry
and she does throw fits.

256
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,960
When she throws fits, she throws things.

257
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,345
I'm hearing a lot of noise,

258
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,532
like if she is, like, throwing metal.

259
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,618
Like, pots and pans banging and stuff.

260
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,437
You know what I mean?

261
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,657
She's got a lot of issues.

262
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,841
You said things are getting more personal.

263
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,443
What do you mean by that?

264
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:05,247
About a year after I started working here,

265
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:09,401
I was doing some work behind
the screen in the hallway.

266
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,721
And I felt a fairly firm grip

267
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,423
on my left shoulder.

268
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,224
Now, Paul, I really want to
see where you got grabbed.

269
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,759
- Can you show me?
- Yes.

270
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:19,661
Okay.

271
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,397
I was installing this plywood

272
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:26,034
on the back of that
framework of that structure.

273
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,502
Okay. So, you were facing this way?

274
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:28,770
Facing toward the screen.

275
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,672
And right after that,

276
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:34,242
I felt a firm grip on my left shoulder,

277
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,827
but I immediately turned around.

278
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:39,748
I knew no one could fit behind me.

279
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,916
Now, there's a lot of stuff back here.

280
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,884
Are you sure something didn't fall on you?

281
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,053
It wasn't something that fell and bounced.

282
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,557
It was a firm grip that,
as soon as I turned around,

283
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,125
they released it.

284
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,376
Well, Paul, I can see why your daughter

285
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:52,961
is so worried about you.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,967
It feels like I'm being punched.

287
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,377
A male.

288
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:13,381
He's dead, and he doesn't
feel good being dead.

289
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,016
He feels terrible.

290
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,719
Does he have any kind of
interaction with the living?

291
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:20,355
He goes in their body.

292
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:22,657
That's how he communicates.

293
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:26,661
I think that people would
feel very drained by him.

294
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,564
They would feel almost frozen physically,

295
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,900
like, they couldn't move or walk.

296
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:34,102
They wouldn't be able to breathe well.

297
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:35,670
I think that they might even

298
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,106
feel like they're having a heart attack.

299
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,477
Now, this doesn't happen very often,

300
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:00,247
but the very first call I made paid off.

301
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,781
I reached out to the local county sheriff,

302
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,900
and he tells me one of
the very first managers

303
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,120
of Kimberly's theater was
involved in a bizarre homicide.

304
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:09,723
He says the story
involved betrayal, revenge,

305
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,691
and was finally settled with a bullet.

306
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,364
You mentioned on the phone

307
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,165
that there was this love triangle

308
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,984
that ended up in a homicide

309
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,103
directly associated with the
theater I'm investigating.

310
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,056
Yes, sir. Back in 1932,

311
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:29,759
a gentleman by the name of Frank Celoud

312
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,845
was offered a promotion

313
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,049
to manage what was called
back then the Fox Theater.

314
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,553
- Okay.
- So he moved his wife...

315
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,022
that's Gladys Celoud...

316
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,257
and his infant daughter to Marshall.

317
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,926
So, what happened? What went wrong?

318
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,262
A few months after the Celouds took over,

319
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,530
Frank Celoud got wind

320
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:53,199
that his wife was having an affair

321
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:56,703
- with a gentleman by the name of Estel Turner.
- Okay.

322
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,906
And this would be Mr. Estel Turner.

323
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,577
Estel Turner was a young man, 21 years old,

324
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,545
worked over here at the local shoe factory

325
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,913
back in those days.

326
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,481
This guy looks kind of smug, too.

327
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,733
He does.

328
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:14,521
Frank finds out and then
he approaches Estel Turner.

329
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:18,658
Frank Celoud offers
him this sort of a deal.

330
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,927
He said, "Well, if you're
not gonna leave her alone,"

331
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,862
he said, "I'll just back out of the picture"

332
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:27,317
and give Gladys to you on one condition.

333
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,402
"And that condition is you're
gonna have to marry her."

334
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,371
Estel thinks about it a couple minutes

335
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,007
and says, "You know, I'm not gonna do that."

336
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,208
I'm not gonna carry the weight

337
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:39,512
of breaking up your family.

338
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,664
"I'll just leave her alone."

339
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:41,831
So, Sheriff, I know

340
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,783
this doesn't have a
happy ending, this story.

341
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,585
- It does not have a happy ending.
- Okay.

342
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:46,653
So, what happens next?

343
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,189
About maybe a month later,

344
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:53,259
Frank Celoud takes his
wife, Gladys, to a dance

345
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:54,928
- over at the old Elk's Lodge...
- Okay.

346
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,230
which at that time
was right across the street

347
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,566
from the theater that he was managing.

348
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,335
- Estel Turner shows up.
- Okay.

349
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,504
And sometime during the dance,

350
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,241
Estel Turner comes over
and approaches Gladys,

351
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,777
and asks her for a dance
and starts talking to her.

352
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:13,713
- Got a lot of balls on this guy, right?
- Yes.

353
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,700
Frank Celoud approached Estel Turner

354
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,451
and yells, you know,

355
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,904
"If you don't leave my wife
alone, I'm gonna kill you."

356
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,322
I would have killed
this guy a long time ago.

357
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,690
You and I both.

358
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,141
What happens?

359
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,560
Frank leaves the theater, alone.

360
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,929
Estel approaches Frank Celoud

361
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,666
and they get into another argument.

362
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:36,353
Frank Celoud gets angry
enough that he pulls

363
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,522
a.380 semi-automatic
pistol from his pocket

364
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,108
and fires a round into
Estel Turner's chest.

365
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,444
So, he winds up shooting this guy

366
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:45,929
right in front of the theater?

367
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,280
Exactly right.

368
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,517
About 10 minutes later, Estel Turner dies.

369
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,053
And I have a copy of the death certificate.

370
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,389
"Gunshot wound

371
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,858
- in the hands of Frank J. Celoud."
- Yes.

372
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,593
Do the cops collar him that night?

373
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,029
- They arrest him that night?
- They arrest him that night.

374
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:08,068
He is charged with first-degree murder.

375
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,204
He actually is arraigned in
this courtroom the next day.

376
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,372
- Right here?
- Right here.

377
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,541
This is pretty much where he stood.

378
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,826
After the jury deliberates
about seven hours,

379
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,479
they come back and they
find him not guilty.

380
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:20,680
You're kidding.

381
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:24,184
I actually have a news
article here, big headlines.

382
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,353
That was a big deal back in 1933.

383
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:28,221
What was his defense?

384
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,355
Back in those days,

385
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:32,542
there was just kind of this unwritten law

386
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,244
to where if something

387
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,763
or somebody threatens your family,

388
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,065
you have a right to defend your family.

389
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:46,439
This guy who jumps people,
someone hated him a lot.

390
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,341
They hated him.

391
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,643
Hated him.

392
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:54,380
And he finally [bleep] got him.

393
00:18:54,466 --> 00:19:01,488
The pain I'm feeling...
is in my upper chest,

394
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,340
but it goes out my back.

395
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,793
I want to say he got shot.

396
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:12,432
Then I'm hearing a woman
screaming and falling down.

397
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:18,371
I don't think he was expecting this,

398
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:24,277
and I think he's really shocked.

399
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:33,186
And he can't move on from this,
'cause it's like a pride thing.

400
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,442
So far, I've got a theater

401
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,460
being terrorized by unexplained activity

402
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,281
and a murder that took place
right outside its front door.

403
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:45,985
But I still need to see
if there's anything else.

404
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,687
Searching through old records,
I find another deadly shooting

405
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,723
involving a guy named James Ming.

406
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,091
Turns out he managed a hotel

407
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,842
that used to operate
right across the street

408
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,028
from my client's property.

409
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,980
So I called on the Marshall police chief

410
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,299
who says he's gonna look
into this case for me.

411
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:05,070
So, Mike, thanks for meeting me

412
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,638
and helping me out with my case.

413
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,040
Now, you know the
theater I'm talking about?

414
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,141
Yes, I do.

415
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,959
I worked there for six years.

416
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,411
- You worked there?
- Yes.

417
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,213
Anything strange happen to
you that you couldn't explain?

418
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:17,232
It was always kind of
eerie, especially, like,

419
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:18,951
if you were the last
person there closing up.

420
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,020
You didn't want to be there alone too much.

421
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,337
Okay. So, Mike,

422
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:25,257
the articles I had seen looked
like Ming killed somebody

423
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,825
that worked for him. Is that right?

424
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,378
What I found out was,
Ming took over management

425
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,296
of Ming House Hotel in 1872.

426
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:32,431
Okay.

427
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,067
It was about 100 feet from the theater,

428
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,069
but it's not in existence anymore.

429
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,721
Now, is Ming a Chinese guy or a white guy?

430
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,622
He's a white guy, late 50s.

431
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,742
On December 22nd of 1898,

432
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,779
Ming asked for his porter, Emmett Craddock,

433
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,013
to come to his room.

434
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,582
Craddock is a 27-year-old black male.

435
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:51,817
Okay.

436
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,719
And he's working for
him, but he's not there.

437
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,454
He's out running an errand for the hotel.

438
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:58,407
Well by the time he gets
back, Ming's outraged.

439
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,858
He's screaming racial slurs at him,

440
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,376
telling him to leave the hotel.

441
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,195
- So, he's firing him, basically?
- Yes.

442
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:05,831
Craddock says, "If you'll
give me my day's wage",

443
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,132
I'll leave.

444
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,201
"But I'm not leaving until I get paid."

445
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:10,569
It gets heated.

446
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,088
And Ming's upset that he has a porter

447
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,474
that's talking to him and
addressing him in a way

448
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,177
that he shouldn't be, since
he's the manager of this hotel.

449
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,678
- Okay.
- But it escalated.

450
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:22,147
And at that point in time,
Ming shot him in the head

451
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,534
with a.32 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver.

452
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:28,854
Ming, who was high on
opiates at that point in time,

453
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,906
- was beyond reasoning with.
- Okay.

454
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,792
So, Mike, I'm assuming he
got charged for this crime?

455
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,094
He was charged with the crime,

456
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,179
but he was deemed legally insane,

457
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,466
so he was never tried for the crime.

458
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,068
They sent him to an
asylum in Nevada, Missouri,

459
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:45,621
- about 150 miles from here.
- Okay.

460
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:48,090
So, now, does he spend the
rest of his life in this place?

461
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,175
Actually, no. After about three months

462
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:54,279
of being in the asylum, he
escapes, about May of 1900.

463
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:55,497
When they caught him,

464
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,332
they wanted him to pack
up and come back with them.

465
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:58,817
So when he went back to the room,

466
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,420
he pulled out a large revolver
and shot himself in the head.

467
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,031
There's some male,

468
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:16,869
and he's telling me to
[bleep] off and get out of here

469
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:17,903
and leave him alone.

470
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,471
And he just wants to be alone.

471
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:22,708
He doesn't want anybody here.

472
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:29,114
I want to say he's between,
like, 1870 and 1910.

473
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:32,701
He was a drinker, a big drinker.

474
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,786
He's just wasted, you know?

475
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:37,523
He's drunk.

476
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:42,094
He's, like, stumbling
around and [bleep] you know?

477
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,130
Oh, he's horrible and
everybody [bleep] hates him.

478
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:46,498
And all this kind of [bleep].

479
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:50,435
You get all the blame,
and he's the one to blame.

480
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,605
Oh, he's just tired of it.

481
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,657
He feels very guilty.

482
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:58,110
He's just showing me, like, dead bodies.

483
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,845
He's like, "Look at the mess I made!"

484
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,880
Look at the mess I made!"

485
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,559
Another thing caught my
eye during the research,

486
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,945
the unsolved murder of a woman.

487
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,430
The last place she's seen alive

488
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:25,434
is right next to the
theater I'm investigating.

489
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,602
I've called on a local author

490
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,803
who's written about the homicide.

491
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:28,837
He says he's got information

492
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,723
that will definitely help my case.

493
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,714
Now, Jason, what do you
know about this case?

494
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,616
The woman's name was Nellie Price.

495
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,718
She was 42 years old,

496
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,671
and she worked for a
shoe manufacturer in town.

497
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,357
Her father was sick, so
she cared for her father.

498
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:49,958
Okay. So,

499
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,960
what are the circumstances
of her disappearance?

500
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,345
Does anybody know what happened?

501
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:55,664
On April 10, 1937,

502
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,300
she left work and was
walking to a local nightclub

503
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,636
to meet a date, a man named Joe Smiley.

504
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,888
She was walking in front a car dealership.

505
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:03,806
She was on the sidewalk.

506
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,140
That was the last time she was seen,

507
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:08,193
and it was right next to the
property you're investigating.

508
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,678
She was never seen again after that?

509
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,947
No, she just vanished.

510
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,982
She had been missing for 17 days.

511
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,153
And this was a really small town in 1937.

512
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,539
People just didn't go missing like that.

513
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:21,790
The town was panicking.

514
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,158
They really wanted to find her.

515
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,027
The entire town searched.

516
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:27,196
The county... all the county
officials, city officials,

517
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,247
were looking for her.

518
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,466
Here's the article on it.

519
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:33,185
They found her on a sand bank.

520
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:36,205
Her arms and legs were
bound with copper wire,

521
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:39,341
and she'd been weighed down
with, uh, with window weights

522
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:40,793
- and a steel rod.
- Okay.

523
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,544
So, what was the official cause of death?

524
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,346
This is the certificate of death.

525
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:47,833
It says right here
strangulation and murder.

526
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,518
Okay. What about this Joe Smiley?

527
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,203
- Cops talk to him?
- Well, yeah.

528
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,354
He was the only suspect that they had.

529
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,273
And then they dismissed him really early,

530
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:56,592
because he had an alibi.

531
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:57,759
So, did the investigators

532
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,895
ever come up with any workable leads?

533
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:00,696
Sadly, no.

534
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:01,864
I mean, 77 years later,

535
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,265
we still don't know who killed her.

536
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,735
That's a shame.

537
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:10,906
The lady in black,
she's, like, crying out.

538
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:14,209
Oh, she's a mess. She's
crying, crying, crying.

539
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,995
The lady in black who throws
things is having a breakdown.

540
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,215
She's frantically telling
me what happened to her.

541
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:22,751
She's talking about a male named Joe.

542
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:26,622
I don't know their
relationship, but this is weird.

543
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:31,026
I think she was in love
with him, or loved him.

544
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:33,896
She's, like, saying,
"It's very complicated."

545
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:36,565
There's a lot... a lot of emotion here.

546
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,568
I think he's dead.

547
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,036
She feels like she's an old woman,

548
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,022
but I don't think that she really is.

549
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:48,677
She's saying that old is, like, 40.

550
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,146
She went missing.

551
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:52,414
Something happened.

552
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:54,650
Like, I don't know. She
was married or engaged.

553
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:57,653
Something with this
engagement or something.

554
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,121
She was running. She was outside.

555
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,856
It was cold.

556
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,225
And she's wet.

557
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:07,095
She feels trapped.

558
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,864
Oh, the neck. Ow.

559
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,365
It hurts a lot.

560
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,003
She's very sad.

561
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,673
And something about falling down, like,

562
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,441
she falls down.

563
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:28,116
I saw dozens of dead people
during my walk, but the dead man

564
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,119
who can jump the living
had me the most concerned.

565
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,156
He's stuck, kind of, in his death state.

566
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:37,025
He had a very chiseled face.

567
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,794
He had a strong jaw.

568
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,562
And he was wearing a suit.

569
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:43,665
And I want to show, like, the dead guy

570
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,602
kind of entering the person's body.

571
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,373
Is this what you saw?

572
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,143
Yes.

573
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,785
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

574
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,520
we're ready to reveal our findings

575
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:25,390
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

576
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:27,793
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet Kimberly.

577
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:30,028
Four years ago, this historic theater

578
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:32,397
was pretty much gonna get torn down.

579
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:33,982
She grew up in this town

580
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:38,303
and wasn't about to let the
town's only theater fail.

581
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,439
So she bought it.

582
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,474
This is Paul. It's her dad.

583
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,776
Paul spends a lot of
time here doing odd jobs.

584
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:46,612
He's here almost every day.

585
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:51,250
He seems to be the main target of
the paranormal activity in this place.

586
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:54,653
Kimberly really wants
to keep the doors open,

587
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:57,222
but not if it's gonna put her
family and employees at risk.

588
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,258
So, with that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy

589
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,793
and see what she can
tell us about her walk.

590
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,330
It was an interesting walk.

591
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:11,603
I felt like I met anybody
who was dead in this town.

592
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:14,039
It was absolutely overwhelming.

593
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:19,528
The major thing that I felt
was anxiety and illness,

594
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:24,683
which is associated with a
lot of the dead that are here.

595
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,185
There's just
an overwhelming sense

596
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,638
of unease and anxiety.

597
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:32,174
Nobody wants to be here alone.

598
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:35,527
I could see why.

599
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:40,132
So the first person
that I met was a female.

600
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,535
She was saying that she felt so old.

601
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,337
I'm like, "Well, you know, how old?"

602
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,688
She's like, "40."

603
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:47,806
Oh, my.

604
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:49,191
She was extremely sad.

605
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,278
She did state that she had gone missing.

606
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,480
She also wears this long, lace dress.

607
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:58,083
And it was all wet.

608
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:01,253
And then she was talking about,
like, a fight with her family

609
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:04,006
and something about a guy.

610
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:08,143
She did say that his name was Joe.

611
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:12,331
I think that she was in love with him.

612
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,983
The problems that she
has here, specifically,

613
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,003
is she doesn't care for
the living very much.

614
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:22,874
She feels like she's not wanted here.

615
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,977
The pain I felt with her
was a lot of neck pain.

616
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,630
It was extremely intense.

617
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:32,234
And she was showing me her throwing a fit.

618
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,419
The sound that I think
the living would hear

619
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,254
would be, like, banging.

620
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,924
- Oh, my God.
- Somebody going ballistic.

621
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:40,409
You hear banging in the basement,

622
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,260
- you were telling me.
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:45,030
That's exactly what it sounds
like, metal hitting metal.

624
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,698
- Yeah.
- You know, it's like a clanging.

625
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,135
It's not your typical pipe noise.

626
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:52,971
I heard two extremely loud noises

627
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,073
after working here for about six months.

628
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:01,696
One, I describe as dropping a
16-pound bowling ball 25 or 30 feet.

629
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,198
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

630
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:04,516
Okay.

631
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:07,719
Well, I've got a pretty good
idea who you're talking about.

632
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:09,421
April 10th of 1937,

633
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:12,824
there was a 42-year-old woman
by the name of Nellie Price.

634
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:16,495
She was on her way to a
date at a local nightclub.

635
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,766
The man she was meeting
was a guy named Joe Smiley.

636
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:23,402
Oh, my God.

637
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:25,404
But she never made her date.

638
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,172
She disappeared into thin air.

639
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:30,442
The last place she was
seen was a car dealership,

640
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,010
which was right next to the theater.

641
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:34,162
- Mm-hmm.
- Now the town went into a panic

642
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,882
was, like, all hands on
deck for a search for her.

643
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,384
I got an article about her murder.

644
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,555
Finally, 17 days later,

645
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,057
she's found by a fisherman in a sandbar

646
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:47,793
- in the Missouri River.
- Oh!

647
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,528
Oh, my gosh.

648
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,279
Right. Wet.

649
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,731
Now, you mentioned something
about the neck, right?

650
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:53,865
- Yes.
- Okay.

651
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:57,702
So I got her death certificate right here.

652
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:59,788
Cause of death is strangulation.

653
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:02,257
Wow.

654
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:04,092
Now, the police did question one suspect.

655
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:05,343
It was this guy, Joe Smiley,

656
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:11,066
that she was supposed to meet that night.

657
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,417
Now, it's 77 years later,

658
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:13,802
and it's still an unsolved case.

659
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:15,253
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:17,155
I didn't know that.

661
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:19,975
I have her picture when she was a little...

662
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:22,227
little bit younger.

663
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,980
Wow.

664
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:26,448
So, could that be her?

665
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,868
I think so, yeah. Definitely.

666
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:32,521
It's so unfair.

667
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:36,675
I just feel heartbroken for her.

668
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:43,748
What else did you see?

669
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,051
I saw a lot going on up here,

670
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:50,422
a lot with talking with the
dead up here, a lot of commotion.

671
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:54,042
And one of the things that
I saw was shadow people.

672
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:58,663
You can see them in the seats...

673
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,402
swooping all over the place.

674
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,542
Oh, my gosh.

675
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:12,878
There was an incident

676
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,614
where my staff member was starting a movie.

677
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,750
And when she turned on the projector,

678
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:21,953
this screen right here
showed a black shadow figure

679
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:26,124
that was really large, almost
filling the whole screen.

680
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,227
Wow.

681
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:33,198
Then, I was in a hallway
that leads to the basement.

682
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,369
And when I was back there, I
saw a dead guy on the floor.

683
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:41,573
And he's very much
stuck in his death state.

684
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:44,042
What I was able to get from him

685
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:47,445
was that there was a woman screaming.

686
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,513
She fell over,

687
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:52,384
and it had something to do with him.

688
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:56,438
And there was another male
who absolutely hated him,

689
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,973
had it out for him.

690
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,559
Like, this man felt hunted almost.

691
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:04,713
And then he said the guy who
hated him finally got him.

692
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,831
And then, what I felt

693
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,602
was an impact on the
left side, in the heart,

694
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:14,489
and exiting out the back.

695
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:18,226
I thought that he was shot.

696
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,912
Wow.

697
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,782
Now, a lot of this stuff
she's just talking about

698
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,483
reminds me of a deadly love triangle

699
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,852
that started and ended
here in your theater.

700
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:30,372
- Okay.
- What?

701
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,623
Back in 1932,

702
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,392
this guy, Frank Celoud,
moved his wife, Gladys,

703
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,177
and infant daughter here to Marshall

704
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:38,530
to manage this theater.

705
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:42,534
This is Frank Celoud...

706
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:46,121
and this is his wife, Gladys.

707
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:49,908
Now, about six months
after they got into town,

708
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,211
- Gladys started having an affair...
- Wow.

709
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:55,513
with a 21-year-old factory worker.

710
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,881
His name was Estel Turner.

711
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,351
I've got his photo as well.

712
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,419
Hmm.

713
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:03,254
Frank confronted him. Said, "Listen."

714
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:04,689
I know you're having
an affair with my wife.

715
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,259
If you're gonna do that, just take her,

716
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:10,795
- "but the deal is, you have to marry her."
- Wow.

717
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,631
- Bizarre, right?
- Yeah.

718
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,033
Estel says, "I don't want to
be breaking up anybody's family.

719
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:18,803
I'll just leave her alone," and ends it.

720
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:21,573
So now Frank thought
the whole thing was over,

721
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:22,774
everything was fine.

722
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,809
Then a month later, Frank
took Gladys to a dance

723
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,012
right across the street
from the theater here.

724
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:30,165
Guess who else was at the dance.

725
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:31,816
Estel.

726
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,853
He had the balls to come over
to his wife after everything,

727
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,388
and try to get her to dance with him.

728
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,523
- Oh, no.
- So Frank got in his face.

729
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:42,410
He says, "If you don't leave
my wife alone, I'll kill you."

730
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,246
Now, Frank was pretty fired up

731
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,414
and he left.

732
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,366
But Estel winded up following him,

733
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:49,701
and they wound up getting
into another argument

734
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,469
right in front of the theater.

735
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,471
Witnesses can hear Frank telling Estel

736
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:56,007
that you lied to me about
staying away from his wife.

737
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,275
Okay.

738
00:34:57,377 --> 00:35:00,378
Pulls out a gun and puts
one right in his chest.

739
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,096
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

740
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,732
Right into his spinal cord.

741
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,551
I've got his death certificate here.

742
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:10,187
It says, "Gunshot wounds at
the hands of Frank Celoud."

743
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:13,058
- Wow.
- Wow.

744
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,409
Hmm.

745
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:15,710
- Did you guys know about this?
- No.

746
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:18,213
I've been here 40 years, never heard of it.

747
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:21,966
Now, do you think this
guy, Estel, is who you saw?

748
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,168
I mean, there are...

749
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:25,587
Obviously, there's a lot
of correlations there.

750
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,971
Let me ask you a question.

751
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:29,374
You mentioned the hallway
behind the screen. Uh-huh.

752
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:33,078
So this is where Paul's
having a lot of interactions.

753
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:35,647
I was working in the hall,

754
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:38,817
and I felt a hand on my shoulder...

755
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,168
on my left shoulder.

756
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,636
I thought it was my daughter,

757
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:45,390
but I turned around,
looked up and down the hall.

758
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:46,541
There was nobody.

759
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:48,393
Wow.

760
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:51,012
That really concerns me,

761
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:56,634
'cause he, like, comes
up from behind a lot.

762
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,954
And he can jump people.

763
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:08,913
I think that people would
feel almost frozen, physically,

764
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:11,683
like they couldn't move or walk.

765
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:15,053
They might even feel like
they're having a heart attack.

766
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:20,125
The pain I felt was not typical.

767
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:23,928
It was very severe and long-lasting.

768
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,396
I have a condition

769
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:29,467
that I got shortly after
we took over the theater.

770
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,903
The doctors tell me I
should be getting better,

771
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,204
but I'm not.

772
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,673
I'm not getting better.
I'm not feeling better.

773
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,558
The muscle pain, the spinal pain.

774
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:38,109
Muscles, joints, spine.

775
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:41,079
Yes, yes.

776
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:42,831
Wow.

777
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:46,951
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

778
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,831
Wow. Take a look at this.

779
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:02,901
Oh, my God.

780
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:23,798
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

781
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:37,195
Wow. Take a look at this.

782
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:40,281
Oh, my God.

783
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,304
That's scary.

784
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:51,609
Now, we talked about Paul

785
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:54,145
getting grabbed on the shoulder.

786
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:58,049
Did it sound like it could be this guy?

787
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,201
That would probably be him, yeah.

788
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,220
I'm convinced that's him.

789
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,091
What is his ultimate
goal when he does that?

790
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:10,094
He wants people to feel how he feels.

791
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,496
Period.

792
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:13,932
Mm-hmm.

793
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,200
I've got to tell you something.

794
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:19,003
Paul had experiences earlier on in life.

795
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,171
Mm-hmm.

796
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:23,741
And he felt that he
somehow brought them here.

797
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,413
- You don't think so?
- No.

798
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,348
So that's got to make you feel better.

799
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,051
Much better. I'm so glad you said that.

800
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,521
I, uh, felt I had some ability

801
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:42,160
to be a magnet for bad
things, so thank you.

802
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:48,149
So, Kimberly, you saved
this theater for the people

803
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:49,434
that live in your town.

804
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,668
You had no way of knowing

805
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,171
- it would also be a meeting place for the dead.
- No.

806
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,389
All right. What's done is done.

807
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:56,140
All right? We've got to look to the future.

808
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,209
The question is, can you stay here safely

809
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,961
with your family and employees,

810
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,246
or is it time to get out

811
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:05,116
and then take a wrecking
ball to this place?

812
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:06,484
For that answer, I'm gonna turn it over

813
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,785
to my partner, Amy.

814
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:11,923
You have a lot going on here.

815
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:17,195
So the goal is to help as many
people move on as possible,

816
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:18,897
and to clear the building

817
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:23,334
so that you guys can set up
a safe space for your family.

818
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,788
So, the first thing, we
have the dead woman, Nellie.

819
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,873
I think we all want to help her.

820
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:33,311
And the best way to do that
is to have a female medium

821
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,980
come in and spend some time with her

822
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,182
and allow her to talk.

823
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,601
What's very important

824
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:43,421
is to also make the statement
from the medium to Nellie

825
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:48,559
that, if she wants to bring
anybody else with her from here,

826
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:50,028
to do it now.

827
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:55,333
There will be a lot of dead
that want to go with her

828
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:59,921
to the next, uh, place.

829
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,640
Now, how do they get rid of
this guy who jumps people?

830
00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:08,079
So what we want to do is bring in a priest.

831
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,316
I want him to come three
times over three months

832
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:14,018
to do a blessing of the entire building.

833
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,987
The other thing that the priest needs to do

834
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:18,106
is to give him his last rites.

835
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:19,891
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

836
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:22,176
And then he'll leave.

837
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,912
And where he goes, the shadow people go.

838
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:26,698
Okay. So, you'll kill
two birds with one stone?

839
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,132
Yes.

840
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,767
There is one more step,
and this is something

841
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,904
that you're doing to make
it peaceful and quiet here.

842
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:34,372
There's a lot of residual here.

843
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:36,924
There's a lot of timelines
that are overlapping and stuff,

844
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:38,276
and this is just muck.

845
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:39,560
So what I want you to do is,

846
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,831
every month... every
month just take some salt.

847
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:48,102
And in each location,
just sprinkle some salt.

848
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:49,771
And while you're doing that, you're saying,

849
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,789
"Only love, light and peace may enter.

850
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,858
All negativity must go."

851
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,461
And what that's gonna
do is just kind of build

852
00:40:56,546 --> 00:41:03,801
an energetic wall of
purity to keep the dead out.

853
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,169
So, when they do all these steps,

854
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:06,838
this place should be pretty good, then?

855
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,806
Yes.

856
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,608
You have a look of relief on your face.

857
00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:15,046
I'm very happy that
there can be a resolution.

858
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:19,083
The cavalry. The cavalry is here.

859
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:21,319
Do I even have to ask if
you're gonna take Amy's advice?

860
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:24,956
I am definitely taking Amy's advice.

861
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,257
It won't be easy

862
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,394
removing the layers of
dead inside this location,

863
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:31,512
but with the help of a medium and a priest,

864
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,064
the dead will be set free,

865
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,566
keeping Kimberly and her
employees and customers

866
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:37,201
safe from harm.
