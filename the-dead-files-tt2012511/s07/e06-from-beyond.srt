1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,924
They're just messing with her...

2
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,014
touching her and manhandling her.

3
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,848
I've seen... we call it the shadow man.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,752
He definitely pushes the living away.

5
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:25,823
I've got a bone-chilling fear
for the safety of our kids.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:30,361
This room is bad, bad.

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,630
I feel like there's evil in here.

8
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:37,351
Why the is he torturing this girl?

9
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,105
Something bad's going to happen.

10
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,741
My name is Amy Allan.

11
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,042
There's panic.

12
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,477
And it's almost like a butchering.

13
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,544
I see dead people.

14
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,680
They all died horribly.

15
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,382
I speak to dead people.

16
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,783
Get out of here.

17
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,418
And they speak to me.

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,453
Vicious.

19
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:59,590
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

20
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,291
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

21
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,860
I rely on my partner.

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,495
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

23
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,397
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

24
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,098
This guy's a real piece of work.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,769
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,270
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

27
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,438
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,707
This is not good.

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,442
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,477
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,246
Until the very end...

32
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,714
I want my life back.

33
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,916
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,718
Is he trying to kill her?

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,986
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,487
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,189
This is going to kill us.

38
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,541
I'm down here in Macon, Georgia.

39
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,177
Amy and I got called in
by a guy named Jeff.

40
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,846
He says his entire
family's being terrorized

41
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,697
by activity in the house,

42
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,950
but he's most concerned
about his youngest daughter,

43
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,652
who's being physically attacked
and can barely sleep at night.

44
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,422
Now, he's a man of faith,
and he tried prayer,

45
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,557
but it seems to be getting worse.

46
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,594
He told me we were his last hope.

47
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,766
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,536
I look for anything that
can influence her findings.

49
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,338
Family photos and other personal items

50
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,874
need to be covered or removed.

51
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,242
When I'm finished,

52
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,644
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,792
Coming up, my body wanted to run...

54
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:45,081
like an instinct, you know,
when you're being hunted.

55
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:50,870
I definitely get that
there's a lot of chaos

56
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,306
going on around here.

57
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,945
It's extremely distracting.

58
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:04,884
I feel extremely ill...
really bad... and very painful.

59
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,653
It's bad.

60
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:14,560
When we spoke on the phone,

61
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,195
it sounded like you were at your wits' end.

62
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,165
Last couple of years,
it's been hell to live here.

63
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,900
What are you and your family going through?

64
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:23,069
We're talking about anywhere

65
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,738
from footsteps to shadow figures...

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,873
Okay.

67
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,409
To hitting, scratching.

68
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,277
Who all lives in the house?

69
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:36,683
It's myself, my wife,
Tami, Jessica, my child,

70
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,085
and my son, Hunter.

71
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:40,253
You mentioned that you
were really concerned

72
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,254
about your youngest daughter.

73
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:42,472
Correct.

74
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:45,091
We've just always been
real protective of her,

75
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:48,861
and she seems to be the one
that mostly gets attacked.

76
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:52,966
And, of course,
she's coming downstairs to us, crying.

77
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:56,369
There's no way for me to protect her.

78
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,822
All you can do is hold her and
tell her it'll be all right,

79
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,307
although you don't know.

80
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,709
That would drive me crazy.

81
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,876
It hurts.

82
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:04,877
The house looks pretty new.

83
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,945
How long have you guys been here?

84
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,830
We've been here 23 years... '91.

85
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,082
We built the house.

86
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:11,584
Did you guys have experiences
from the beginning?

87
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,986
Just mischievous stuff...

88
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:16,556
nothing alarming, nothing frightening.

89
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:17,824
Okay, so why are you calling us now?

90
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:22,128
About a year and a half ago,
it started getting ugly.

91
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,013
Have you guys tried anything

92
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,399
to try to stop what's happening here?

93
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:30,136
A lot of prayer, a lot of shared prayer.

94
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,671
Nothing's helped.

95
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:35,758
I can't physically protect my family.

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,310
I need help.

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,816
So, there's this older man here.

98
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:46,019
He's talking about two bedrooms...

99
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:48,388
two bedrooms that are important here.

100
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,141
There's a male and a
female in these two rooms

101
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,477
that are having the problems.

102
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:01,067
But then there's this other guy who's,
like, younger.

103
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:06,773
The younger guy is accusing
him of being abusive.

104
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,446
There's a relationship there.

105
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:17,383
I'm thinking father/son
or grandfather/grandson.

106
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,619
There's a lot of anger and tension here,

107
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,687
and it's a lot between these two men.

108
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,890
It's completely unhealthy.

109
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,858
It's very, very stressful.

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,527
You know, you can really feel it.

111
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,434
So, why'd you bring me
into the living room?

112
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,770
This is where most of my
stuff has taken place.

113
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,238
Like what?

114
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,924
Me and my son came in the other afternoon.

115
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,544
We were walking through the living room.

116
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:47,964
The fireplace pokers started doing this,

117
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,582
shaking all about.

118
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:50,750
Did it stop?

119
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,851
It stopped.

120
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,820
We came back, walked back and forth,

121
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,621
jumped all around in the room.

122
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,824
It doesn't move.

123
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,991
So we didn't do that.

124
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,827
You guys didn't have a
violent storm or anything,

125
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,662
with hard thunder, or anything like that?

126
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,030
No, no.

127
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,998
Anything else like that ever happen?

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,334
- We came in from church one Sunday...
- Okay.

129
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:11,003
The whole family together.

130
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,072
This sofa's pulled out from the wall.

131
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:16,509
The other sofa behind me is
pulled out from the wall.

132
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:20,246
The recliner is turned around,
facing the window.

133
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:22,081
And you definitely weren't broken into,

134
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,282
and nothing was breached?

135
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,700
Nothing moved.

136
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:27,787
Nothing but those three items were moved.

137
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,055
Hm.

138
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:34,327
As far as in here,
I'm seeing movement issues.

139
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,630
I am seeing leaving a room, and it's...

140
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,065
something's set up...

141
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,367
say the balls are set up
a certain way coming back

142
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,753
and everything's...

143
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,271
scattered.

144
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,909
But I don't know who
the [bleep] is doing it.

145
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,210
Nobody's copping to it.

146
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,036
So, Tami,
I was talking to your husband, Jeff,

147
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,954
about stuff that's going on in the house.

148
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,756
Curious how you're handling things.

149
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,625
You know, it's just day to day.

150
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:10,730
I've got just a bone-chilling fear

151
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:13,065
for the safety of our kids at this point.

152
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,117
And, Tami, when I talked to Jeff,

153
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,570
he seemed to think that whatever's here's

154
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:18,905
kind of picking on Jessica.

155
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:19,956
Is that accurate?

156
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,908
Oh, I would definitely agree with that.

157
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,993
There's a lot more activity with Jessica

158
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,378
that's a lot more physical.

159
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,779
That's got to kill you, as a mom.

160
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,981
It breaks my heart.

161
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,700
You're constantly scared.

162
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:34,554
You don't know what's gonna
happen next to your children.

163
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:37,190
Now, what about yourself?
What about your experiences?

164
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:38,357
Have you had any?

165
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,060
I was sleeping on my
side of the bed one night

166
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,564
and felt someone sit on
the side of the bed,

167
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:47,283
and it was, like, someone heavy.

168
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:50,770
I mean, you could feel the mattress go down

169
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,623
to the point that it
pulled the covers tight

170
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,408
on the bottom part of my leg.

171
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,776
And you're sure it wasn't a dream?

172
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,744
Positive it wasn't a dream.

173
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,646
- Anything else?
- Yes.

174
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,583
There is a presence in
this corner periodically.

175
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,419
It's always in the corner,
by the gun cabinet.

176
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:09,455
And you immediately know
you're being watched.

177
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,224
What do you think this is?

178
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,226
I have no idea, Steve.

179
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,430
All I know is it's dangerous,
it's threatening,

180
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,600
and it seems to be getting worse.

181
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:30,376
This older man is definitely
causing people to be afraid.

182
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,978
If they irritate him at all,

183
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,747
he does creepy [bleep] to
kind of freak them out.

184
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:37,083
What does he do to them?

185
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,502
He'll come at night

186
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:44,457
and, like, move around like a
big spider on the floor...

187
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,825
on all fours.

188
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:52,965
But they're seeing, like,
this dark thing, you know,

189
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,102
moving around the floor and the room,

190
00:08:56,104 --> 00:09:00,206
going under the bed,
and this freaks people out.

191
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,042
Or stand in the corner and watch people.

192
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:07,680
It is creepy, and people do see,

193
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,099
like, this black thing in the corner.

194
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:11,984
Do you know what this old
man wants with the living?

195
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:16,489
He wants to control them

196
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:18,991
like he controlled the
people when he was alive.

197
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,360
So, Hunter,
I was talking to your parents,

198
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,427
and they were telling me

199
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,662
you're having a pretty tough time here.

200
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,364
Yeah.

201
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,666
I feel very unwanted in the house.

202
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,201
Okay. What are you going through?

203
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,771
I see... we call it the shadow man.

204
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:57,041
I've seen it, you know,
20-plus times, easy.

205
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,943
And it's most of the time

206
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,579
right in between those windows right there.

207
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,280
Is it possible that it's a shadow

208
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,849
reflected from outside at all?

209
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,485
I keep my blinds down.
They're blackout blinds.

210
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,036
You can't see through them.

211
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,271
Really?

212
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,289
I know your sister's
going through some stuff.

213
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,324
You and her discuss this.

214
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,710
I try to keep it to myself, honestly.

215
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,261
She's already on edge.

216
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:21,832
You know, I've had probably
up to 10 calls from her...

217
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,000
"Hey, are you in the house?"

218
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,268
"No, I'm not even at the house."

219
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,003
She said, "I'm the only one home.

220
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,638
There's somebody in the house."

221
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,126
It's definitely attracted to her,
for some reason,

222
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,345
and I don't know why.

223
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,817
I think the two bedrooms
the old man was talking about...

224
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,786
they're upstairs.

225
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,273
Mmm, there's a male here,

226
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:50,161
and there's some kind of
bonding between this person

227
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,796
and the female in the other room.

228
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,750
There's something about the windows.

229
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:58,636
Uh... I didn't like the windows.

230
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:03,707
The female...

231
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:11,715
This room is, like, bad, bad.

232
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,528
So, Jessica,
I was talking to Mom, Dad,

233
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,863
and your brother, Hunter,

234
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:29,967
and it seems like whatever's
here is kind of targeting you.

235
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,168
Mm-hmm.

236
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,605
Okay, what are some of the
things that are happening?

237
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,575
Well, a lot of times,
my drawers open by themselves.

238
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,111
They just open, all of them.

239
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:43,798
They're almost to the point

240
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,766
where they're falling out of the dresser.

241
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:46,917
- That far out?
- Yes.

242
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,086
Is there anything else
moving around in the room.

243
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,988
Well, I've actually seen

244
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,757
what I thought was a man in my room.

245
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,060
It was in front of my bed,

246
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,729
and it was actually going
through my paperwork

247
00:11:58,731 --> 00:11:59,964
on my table.

248
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:03,968
I heard the paper shuffling,
so that's why I woke up.

249
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,337
I called out to him, and he didn't answer,

250
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,139
so I turned to turn on the light,

251
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,374
and I came back, and the papers were moved.

252
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:13,744
They were open,
when originally they were closed.

253
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,379
Okay.

254
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,847
How are you sleeping at night?

255
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,951
I do have nightmares all the time,
and I sleepwalk.

256
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,420
Give me an example of what you're dreaming.

257
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:24,722
I'd be outside.

258
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,223
The sky was red,

259
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,527
and everything had almost a red tint.

260
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,128
Okay.

261
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,981
People would be dancing.

262
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:38,002
And then everyone would stop
and just turn their head

263
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,403
like they were looking at something.

264
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,039
But then I'd wake up,

265
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,041
so I never saw what they were looking at.

266
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,477
Okay.

267
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:52,383
This female... she has horrible nightmares,

268
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,852
horrible [bleep] nightmares...

269
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,905
some she remembers, some she doesn't.

270
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,191
Like,
I see her waking up outside the house like,

271
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,892
"What the [bleep] What the [bleep]"

272
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,646
But I don't know if
these are just nightmares

273
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,264
that she's having.

274
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:11,602
When she's having these experiences,

275
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:15,773
I think there's another force here,

276
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:20,844
and it's causing a lot
of physical phenomena.

277
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,348
What the [bleep]

278
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,400
What's going on?

279
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,236
She does see the older man. He watches.

280
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:32,106
He calls himself "The Watcher"
when all the [bleep] going on.

281
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,759
Why the [bleep] is he torturing this girl?

282
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,714
They'll touch me.

283
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,349
I've been doing my hair before,

284
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:46,303
and it just grabbed it right
here and just snatched it.

285
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:51,173
And they were big fingers,
so I felt like it was more of a man.

286
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:52,123
Wow.

287
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,236
From that point, it only got worse.

288
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:58,682
At one point,
something actually laid down behind me.

289
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:01,652
It almost felt like it was spooning.

290
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,154
It had its head, like, on me.

291
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:05,656
I mean, I was terrified.

292
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:06,724
I couldn't move.

293
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:07,891
I couldn't speak.

294
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:09,226
I couldn't even cry.

295
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,929
And then it finally just got up,
and I heard it walk out.

296
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:15,933
And at that point, I just started crying.

297
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,768
Like, I bawled my eyes out.

298
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,737
Okay.

299
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,072
And I've woken up with scratches.

300
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,324
Okay.

301
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,109
You guys have a cat, right?

302
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,243
Oh, my cat's declawed.

303
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,747
How often is that happening...
the scratches?

304
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,216
The scratches only
happened like three times.

305
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,350
<i>Only</i> three times?

306
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,668
You hear what you're saying?

307
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,136
I have a daughter 23 years old.

308
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,439
I couldn't imagine her coming to me

309
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,758
and telling me the stuff you're saying.

310
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,127
That would kill me.

311
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:46,864
I feel like there's evil in here.

312
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:49,233
I want it to leave.

313
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,268
I want our lives back.

314
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:53,971
Okay.

315
00:14:55,775 --> 00:15:01,979
There's these little,
dark things, like children.

316
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,281
They're black.

317
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:10,554
They're around the bed
and touching her feet.

318
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,056
They're climbing on the bed.

319
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,857
They're climbing on her.

320
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:16,727
They're incapacitating
her so she can't move.

321
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,096
She can't yell. She can't do anything.

322
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,800
She's like...

323
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:26,070
Like, the air gets sucked out.

324
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,106
I feel uncomfortable.

325
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,310
I'm getting chills. Okay, I'm freaking out.

326
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:50,324
When I get to a new town,
I put my feelers out

327
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,493
to cops, historians, local professors.

328
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,161
In this case, it paid off.

329
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:57,896
I'm on my way to meet
with a local genealogist

330
00:15:57,898 --> 00:16:00,698
who says all the early owners
of Jeff and Tami's property

331
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,866
were slave owners.

332
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,968
Now,
I don't know if it's gonna help my case,

333
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,471
but it's something I
definitely want to check out.

334
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,557
So, Cecil, you mentioned on the phone

335
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,107
that some of the early owners

336
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,509
of the property I'm
investigating had slaves.

337
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,594
That's correct.

338
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:21,845
Okay, what can you tell me about them?

339
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,980
Well, the earliest guy
that we have recorded

340
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,048
was named John Martin.

341
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,601
He shows up in 1830 census.

342
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:30,887
And it shows that he owned 33 slaves.

343
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,888
33?

344
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,023
33.

345
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,610
He was a slave trader
for the area of Macon,

346
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,495
as well as he was a farmer.

347
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,263
I guess that would explain why so many.

348
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:41,413
Yes.

349
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,061
Okay, so, now,
how long does he have the property?

350
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,847
Well,
we have record that he sold the property

351
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:49,048
in 1837 to a guy named Alexander Hunt.

352
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,383
Okay, so now he moves there.

353
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,517
Is he a slave owner, too?

354
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,587
The 1850 census right here shows

355
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,523
that Alexander has 38 slaves,

356
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,692
so he has a few more than John Martin did.

357
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:02,295
Wow. All right, so...

358
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,597
for some reason,
this property has an abundance of slaves.

359
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,332
Right.

360
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,842
Okay, there's another man down here.

361
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:18,711
He's got issues.

362
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,750
He is very angry.

363
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,652
Probably like six foot.

364
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,986
He's a big guy,

365
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:30,523
big, round dude... like, chubby and built.

366
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:37,764
He's, like, sweating,
and he's really angry, and hot.

367
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,336
He's very protective of his space.

368
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,005
He doesn't really want
anybody else down here.

369
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,709
So he definitely pushes the living away.

370
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,546
People would feel him like a wall, like,

371
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:56,516
coming up behind them, like,
just kind of pushing them out.

372
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,056
The property's then sold to Joshua Harris.

373
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,591
Okay, now, what about him,
as far as slaves go?

374
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,293
According to the records,
he only has six slaves.

375
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,329
Okay, so how's it go for Joshua?

376
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,047
Everything seems to be going pretty well

377
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,165
until the Civil War comes,

378
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,267
and in 1862,

379
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,002
one of his sons joins the Confederate Army.

380
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,070
His name's James.

381
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:18,171
Okay.

382
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,922
Do we have any idea how old that kid was?

383
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,074
James was 20.

384
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,442
After he was in,

385
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,910
just north of Atlanta, he was captured,

386
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,144
and he was held prisoner of war.

387
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,997
Joshua Harris had another son

388
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,949
that was just a year younger,
named Franklin.

389
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,150
Franklin, I would assume,

390
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,719
did the same thing as his brother.

391
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,120
No, Franklin did not join.

392
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:35,855
Why not?

393
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,740
I get the impression that
his dad encouraged him

394
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,858
and wanted him to,

395
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,193
but you know how sometimes children are...

396
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:41,577
no matter what you ask them to do,

397
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,695
they do just the opposite.

398
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,031
There's always a rebellious
one in the crowd.

399
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,632
So, now, the war ends.

400
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:48,534
What happens with Joshua and the farm?

401
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:50,536
Well,
Joshua was able to hold onto the property,

402
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:52,271
whereas many landowners were not able to.

403
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,774
Okay, so does he stay there,
or does he move on?

404
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:58,611
He stays there until he dies
in 1895 at the age of 85.

405
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,980
Okay, what happened to his son James?

406
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:03,349
James is released as a prisoner of war

407
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,984
when the war's over, and he comes back.

408
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:08,588
What about the son, Franklin,
that never went off to war?

409
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,724
Well, sometime after 1895,
after his dad's death,

410
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:14,477
Franklin and two of the sisters leave,

411
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,613
and we find record of
them in 1899 in Texas.

412
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,867
Okay,
so did Franklin inherit any of the land?

413
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,736
Either he wasn't left any,
or maybe he sold his part.

414
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,304
Okay.

415
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:32,378
I'm seeing the older and younger man again.

416
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,781
And they're fighting.

417
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,016
It's uncomfortable.

418
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,951
That younger guy was saying

419
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:44,390
that this older man was abusive,
physically abusive...

420
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,193
you know,
that he was [bleep] torturing the family.

421
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,432
He ruled with an iron fist.

422
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:58,337
And I heard words, which was,
"father," "landowner," "slave."

423
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:02,742
The younger man doesn't
have anything in common

424
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,710
with this older man.

425
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:05,912
He doesn't like him.

426
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,647
There's a lot of anger
and resentment there.

427
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:12,018
The older man's perspective
to the younger man,

428
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,722
there's a sense of disappointment.

429
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:20,026
And do you know if they have any kind

430
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,895
of connection to this property?

431
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:24,330
Definitely the land.

432
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:28,985
The younger man just kept
talking about the land.

433
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:34,040
He was talking about a massacre,
something about a war.

434
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:38,377
He said that there were
a lot of innocent people.

435
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,647
He also said something about murders.

436
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:44,250
He said the dead weren't respected here.

437
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:59,886
So far,
I've got a family being terrorized

438
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,187
by unexplained activity

439
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:03,769
and a property that was
home to dozens of slaves.

440
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,255
But I need to see if there's anything else

441
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:08,456
that will help my case.

442
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,928
Searching through old records,
I find a battle

443
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,380
that broke out between Union
and Confederate soldiers

444
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,065
right on my client's property.

445
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,771
Obviously,
I need to know more about this fight,

446
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,073
so I reached out to a
local Civil War expert

447
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,608
who says it was a bloody battle

448
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,177
and the information will
definitely help my case.

449
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,004
So, Michael,
why'd you want to meet here?

450
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:41,264
Joshua Harris,
who owned your client's property

451
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:42,830
during the American Civil War...

452
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,232
- Yeah?
- is buried right here.

453
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:49,203
And how close is this spot
to my client's property?

454
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,573
Probably 800, 900 yards.

455
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:52,740
Okay.

456
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,292
Now, you mentioned on the phone

457
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:55,810
that there was a bloody battle

458
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:57,545
that took place right on the property.

459
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:58,746
- Yes.
- What happened?

460
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,749
Steve,
I'm sure you've heard of Sherman's March.

461
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,217
I have.

462
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:06,721
Troops moving from Atlanta to Savannah,

463
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:10,458
wreaking havoc along the way...
tearing up rail road tracks,

464
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,912
stealing crops, livestock, burning barns,

465
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,997
things of military value.

466
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:19,417
And this is a period
etching that an artist did

467
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,136
depicting some of that destruction.

468
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:26,291
The Confederates knew that
Sherman was approaching,

469
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,593
so they sent various units out

470
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:31,045
to establish defensive positions,

471
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,714
one of them right here.

472
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:35,216
Okay, so what happened?

473
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,619
On November 20, 1864,

474
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:41,422
Sherman's cavalry came right
down this road out here.

475
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:44,492
The Confederate troops were lying in wait

476
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:46,961
in the heavily wooded area
on each side of the road

477
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:48,262
on your client's property.

478
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,397
Okay.

479
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,767
And as the first soldiers got close enough,

480
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,602
the Confederates charged.

481
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:55,937
Okay,
so they got attacked and ambushed here.

482
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,138
Yes.

483
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,742
And when the smoke of
battle began to dissipate,

484
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:03,478
seven Confederates lay dead.

485
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:07,382
What about the Union side...
any casualties?

486
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,834
The records do not tell
us that information,

487
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:11,619
but it is certainly possible,

488
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:16,557
and if we did have dead
Federal soldiers here,

489
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,360
most likely, the Confederates would have

490
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,863
interred them in a mass grave.

491
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:26,467
Steve, I think the real kicker,
for Harris in particular...

492
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:29,470
earlier in 1864, Georgia's governor

493
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:32,740
had ordered a census statewide.

494
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:36,077
He wanted to capture the
names and locations

495
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,580
of all male citizens
eligible to be called up

496
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:42,166
into the service of the militia.

497
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,418
Okay.

498
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,021
Guess whose name appears on that list.

499
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:48,756
Our guy, Joshua Harris.

500
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,391
Wow.

501
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:53,761
So I think there is a very good possibility

502
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,680
he was fighting on his own property.

503
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:01,369
I am seeing a lot of activity.

504
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:06,007
There's a lot of men in
both of these directions.

505
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,412
That group is very large.

506
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,482
That one's the big one.

507
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:15,683
That's a lot of men.

508
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,219
That's, like, you know, war.

509
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:23,257
Like, I'm definitely feeling,
you know, panic and stress,

510
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,093
and, you know, it's loud.

511
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:30,615
And there's... that's very sneaky.

512
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,316
It was very sneaky.

513
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,701
It was planned.

514
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:36,604
There was a lot of yelling between them.

515
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:39,373
I think that they were being hunted,

516
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,409
and that's why they're
freaking the [bleep] out

517
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:42,877
and trying to hide [bleep]

518
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:45,880
Then I'm getting the
[bleep] pain in my head

519
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,482
like a son of a [bleep]

520
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:49,901
It hurts a lot.

521
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:59,777
I encountered several dead
people during my walk,

522
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,630
but the dark things
surrounding a living girl's bed

523
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,799
had me the most concerned.

524
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,168
There was a thing.

525
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,640
It was actually standing
to the side of her.

526
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:17,211
Same body shape as the child.

527
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:21,015
It had its hand over her mouth,

528
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:24,102
and the way that the arm
and the hand looked

529
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:26,387
was not normal.

530
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,957
Is this what you saw?

531
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:33,194
Yes, that's what I saw.

532
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:55,796
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

533
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,932
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

534
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:00,668
and our clients for the first time.

535
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,537
Amy, I'd like you to meet
two very worried parents,

536
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,739
Jeff and Tami.

537
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,275
Everybody in the house
is having experiences,

538
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:11,278
including their son, Hunter,
who I have a picture of here.

539
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:13,814
Okay.

540
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:16,283
Now, the main reason we're here
is their daughter, Jessica.

541
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:19,119
She's going through hell.

542
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,654
And it's killing Jeff and Tami

543
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:22,723
that they can't do nothing to help her.

544
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:24,225
And we're their last hope.

545
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,412
So now that Amy knows who you guys are,

546
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:29,897
I'm gonna have her tell us about her walk.

547
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,525
So, when I was outside,

548
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,395
the first thing that I
saw was a lot of chaos.

549
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,398
There was some kind of big battle.

550
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,933
There was a lot of men.

551
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,336
There was some general who was,
like, pacing around.

552
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,506
Something about a massacre,

553
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:55,779
and I could feel there's so
much stress in this area.

554
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:57,862
I think I know
what you might have seen.

555
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:00,315
I wasn't shocked to find
that there was gonna be

556
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:03,818
Civil War activity in this area,

557
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,887
but what I was shocked about
is that you had a battle

558
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,373
that took place right on your property.

559
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,209
Now, what happened is in 1864,

560
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:14,112
General Sherman led the
Union Army on a march.

561
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,646
It started it Atlanta,

562
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:17,081
and he was going through the whole state.

563
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,817
I got an artist's
depiction of what happened.

564
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,253
They destroyed everything.

565
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:24,555
Now, on November 20th of that year,

566
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:27,725
the Union Army came right
across your property here,

567
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,293
where they got ambushed.

568
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,497
But it turned out worse
for the Confederate side,

569
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,832
'cause they were badly outgunned.

570
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,301
They wound up killing
seven Confederate soldiers

571
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:38,770
right here on your land.

572
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:39,871
Wow.

573
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:42,006
Now, did you guys know about the battle?

574
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,574
- No.
- No idea.

575
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:46,010
We knew there was Civil
War activity around here,

576
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:48,096
but we had no idea a battle took place.

577
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,252
So, what else did you see?

578
00:27:54,254 --> 00:27:59,057
As soon as I walked in,
I saw this older male.

579
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:02,527
He would show himself

580
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:05,630
dressed in, like,
a black cloak and black hat.

581
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:10,435
He was extremely tall, and he was angry.

582
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,403
The other thing he made known

583
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:15,340
was that he likes to make people feel fear.

584
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,676
I was actually in the master bedroom,

585
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:22,680
and he slid into the
corner and was watching,

586
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,616
and that's part of his thing,

587
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:28,453
is he likes to watch people a lot.

588
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:32,730
I also got him, like,
squatting down like a spider

589
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:37,768
and, like,
moving around the floor very quickly.

590
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,905
There's a presence in my room,
in the corner,

591
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:44,842
that I'll wake up and I know
immediately I'm being watched,

592
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:47,511
and it's interesting that you said

593
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:50,347
about him getting small
and towards the floor,

594
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:53,334
because Jeff and I have
recently talked about how

595
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:54,952
we'll go to get in the bed,

596
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,253
and it's almost like you're a kid

597
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:57,638
and you're afraid for your feet

598
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,206
to get close to the edge of the bed.

599
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,257
Mm-hmm.

600
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:02,143
54 years old, I'm a grown man,

601
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:05,963
and sometimes you feel like a
kid running to jump in the bed.

602
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,131
Mm-hmm.

603
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,232
I see the shadow person

604
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:10,868
usually in the middle of the floor.

605
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,103
It was looking through my papers,
like it was nosy.

606
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:17,291
But Hunter sees him more than I do.

607
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,046
Wow. Okay.

608
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,514
When I look into my brother's eyes,

609
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:25,749
I can tell he's scared.

610
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:28,853
I'm supposed to be the
protector of my home,

611
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:30,855
and there's nothing I can do.

612
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:37,611
Any idea who this
guy might have been

613
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:38,729
when he was living?

614
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:44,335
Most of the information I got about him

615
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:48,422
was actually through another person...
a younger man.

616
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:52,376
The younger man has a lot
of anger and resentment

617
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:55,446
towards this older man,
so I kind of got, like,

618
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,081
there was some kind of
family connection here,

619
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:01,585
whether this was father and son
or grandfather and grandson.

620
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:05,589
The older man,
the only thing that came from him

621
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,541
was his disappointment in the younger man,

622
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:08,959
which the younger man
doesn't give a [bleep] about.

623
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:10,394
He's like, "I don't care."

624
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:18,335
And I heard three words... "father,"
"landowner," "slave."

625
00:30:20,072 --> 00:30:21,739
One thing you got to
know about the property...

626
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,557
the earliest owners all had slaves.

627
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:27,061
There was three different
owners that owned your land

628
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:28,946
that had slaves before
the Civil War broke out.

629
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:30,664
The last slave owner who lived on the land

630
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,117
was a guy named Joshua Harris,
who came here in 1858.

631
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,903
Big reason I'm thinking it's him

632
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:38,422
is because of the
relationship with his son.

633
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:39,557
This guy, Joshua Harris,

634
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,191
was a big supporter of the Confederacy.

635
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,610
It was where we lived, obviously.

636
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:43,727
Now, I have a census here

637
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:46,764
that says he was a reserve militia

638
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:48,732
for the Confederate army.

639
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,034
This guy was in his mid-'50s,

640
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,069
so that'll give you an idea
of how supportive he was.

641
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,839
Now, he had a son named James who was 20,

642
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,308
and he enlisted in the Confederate Army.

643
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,677
Now, he had another son,
Franklin, who was 19,

644
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,812
who refused to go off and fight.

645
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:05,583
Now, the genealogist I spoke
to about the Harris family

646
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,351
said that it probably
caused a lot of tension

647
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:08,686
within the family.

648
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:11,789
That's the only guy I can
think of that fits that bill.

649
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:15,159
Yeah.

650
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,560
Sounds like them.

651
00:31:16,562 --> 00:31:20,381
Now,
the thing about this Joshua Harris guy...

652
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:22,082
he's actually buried right
here on the property.

653
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,168
Oh, my God.

654
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,870
You could probably throw a
rock how far he is from here.

655
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:30,374
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

656
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,792
Wow.

657
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:34,178
We had absolutely no
idea he was over there.

658
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:43,520
So,
when I was talking to the older man,

659
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:47,408
he showed me that there
were two rooms in the house

660
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,728
that were the most active,

661
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,796
and these were two bedrooms,
male and a female.

662
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,969
And when I walked upstairs,
I knew exactly the two bedrooms,

663
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:02,072
and that this was, in fact,
what he showed me.

664
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:06,076
So I went into the room where the boy was,

665
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:09,213
and a lot of the chaos in there

666
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:13,417
was the extreme amount of noise...

667
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:14,635
movement.

668
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:17,187
The window's what I got
was making the female

669
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:22,126
in the other room feel,
like, sad and isolated,

670
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,462
because the boy had kind of pulled away

671
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:29,016
from being so close.

672
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,337
Is what she's saying
making any sense to you?

673
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:34,638
She's nailing it.

674
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,641
That's exactly how I feel all the time.

675
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:42,680
It's like he's really distanced
himself from everybody.

676
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:47,985
Well, then I went into the other room,

677
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:54,358
and what I was seeing was
horrible nightmares...

678
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,460
horrible.

679
00:32:56,462 --> 00:33:04,134
And I saw, like, you waking up
occasionally in strange places.

680
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:08,305
We talked about that...
how you sleepwalk.

681
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:10,941
Yeah. I know that I woke up
in my brother's room before.

682
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:14,311
Tell Amy about some of
those dreams you had.

683
00:33:14,313 --> 00:33:18,015
Well, there were a bunch of people outside.

684
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:20,017
Everything just had this red...

685
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,052
- Glow?
- tint, yes.

686
00:33:22,054 --> 00:33:24,021
And everybody was dancing,

687
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:27,991
and then they all looked
up like they saw somebody,

688
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:31,128
but when I would look,
I would just wake up.

689
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,763
Interesting.

690
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:34,782
It was very weird.

691
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,517
Hm.

692
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,138
So, what I saw was,
during some of these nightmares,

693
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,007
that there was actually
phenomena going on...

694
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:48,529
like, lights flickering,
doors opening and closing,

695
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,381
objects moving, things of that nature.

696
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:55,385
When I was younger, it
was just minor stuff,

697
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:56,553
like drawers pulling out.

698
00:33:56,555 --> 00:33:58,055
I remember that my whole life.

699
00:33:58,057 --> 00:34:00,023
Me and Hunter walked through one day,

700
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,658
just a couple of weeks ago,

701
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,228
and the fireplace pokers about fell over.

702
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,097
Okay.

703
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:10,968
What I was seeing was you were in the bed,

704
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:17,007
and I saw these three things
that were surrounding the bed.

705
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:21,361
And at first I thought,
"Okay, those are children,"

706
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:25,599
'cause they're little,
all-black, like black shadow,

707
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,684
but solid.

708
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:31,989
Then I saw that one was
actually grabbing your feet,

709
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:36,460
and the other one, up by your head,

710
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:38,862
had its hand over your mouth.

711
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:41,932
What they were doing was manhandling you,

712
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:47,004
basically incapacitating you...

713
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:48,672
holding you down,

714
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:52,142
and they were laughing at
you because you were afraid.

715
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,897
The other thing I saw in your room

716
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:58,515
was the old man again,

717
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:02,419
and he loves when this is going on.

718
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:04,555
He thinks it's absolutely fascinating.

719
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:05,839
And that's why he goes up

720
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,091
and he'll watch when this is all happening.

721
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:11,295
She's got some stuff going on.

722
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:12,763
She feels like she's being spooned in bed.

723
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,798
Yes.

724
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,418
I woke up,
and I could feel something behind me,

725
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,039
spooning me, and its head was,
like, right here,

726
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,624
and I couldn't move.

727
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,442
I couldn't breathe. I couldn't cry.

728
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:30,380
I couldn't turn my light on.
And it scratched me.

729
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:34,551
I've woken up with scratches on my back.

730
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:36,720
Oh, man.

731
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:38,372
You kind of gasped when you heard

732
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:39,857
that she was spooned in bed.

733
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,825
Well, that happened to me.

734
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:48,131
It was the second night after the walk.

735
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,467
I was in my bed,

736
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:55,973
and I felt someone from
behind was holding me,

737
00:35:55,975 --> 00:36:01,144
and it felt very uncomfortable
and inappropriate.

738
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:04,715
And I believe it's the old man.

739
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:09,303
I think he's kind of a predator.

740
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:14,191
I've begged it to leave her alone.

741
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,159
I wish I could go up there

742
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:21,031
and slap the [bleep] out of it,
honestly, and make it leave.

743
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:24,201
I don't even want it to
see that I'm afraid,

744
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:27,170
'cause in a way, that means it wins.

745
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:33,677
Well, I did do a sketch of
what I saw in the bedroom.

746
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:46,790
I got to show it to you.

747
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:58,619
I've seen that.

748
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:17,624
I did do a sketch of
what I saw in the bedroom.

749
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:30,137
I got to show it to you.

750
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,349
I've seen that.

751
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:52,326
The reason I know I've seen that...

752
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:54,845
that's what was trying to touch me.

753
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,619
When I got here, I told you guys

754
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,104
I never know what Amy's gonna see,

755
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:06,473
and I'm sure you weren't expecting

756
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:08,775
to hear what she told us tonight.

757
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:10,243
I wasn't expecting it.

758
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:12,129
At least now you know
what you're dealing with.

759
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,714
The big question is how do you fix it.

760
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:17,417
For that answer, I'll turn it over to Amy.

761
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:23,457
The first thing
that I want to focus on

762
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:27,327
are the dead individuals
that you have in the house.

763
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,030
Obviously, the older man needs to go.

764
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:36,670
So I would like for you to bring
in an older, male medium.

765
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:41,775
I want him to have a lot of
confidence in what he does,

766
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,111
and I do want him to have a certain amount

767
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,614
of, like, gruff, I guess you would say.

768
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:52,319
This probably isn't going to
be a very pleasant situation

769
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:55,322
for the medium or this old man,

770
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:59,626
and there's probably going to
be a lot of fighting happening.

771
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,780
The thing with removing the older man

772
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:07,768
is that his son is going to go immediately.

773
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,604
Once the medium moves on
the older man and his son,

774
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:13,006
I want you to take this tar water

775
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,442
and put it on all of the windowsills

776
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,177
and all of the doorways.

777
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:19,646
This is gonna keep all of
the dead out from now on,

778
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,483
so you'll know there's
no dead people anymore.

779
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:28,588
But you might still have experiences.

780
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,859
What do you mean?

781
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:35,996
Well, I'm saying that there's
a possibility of aliens...

782
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,005
because that thing I
saw was not a dead thing.

783
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,406
It's not a demon.

784
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:49,910
It's something that was visiting

785
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:52,679
and taking you...

786
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,713
and your brother.

787
00:39:57,286 --> 00:39:59,586
Personally,
I have a lot of issues with this,

788
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:03,857
but when I looked and did my
own research of this area,

789
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,527
it was something that
I couldn't not discuss.

790
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,029
Let me get this straight.

791
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,833
You're telling me she's being abducted...
her and her brother?

792
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:15,769
I'm saying it's a very large possibility.

793
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:18,038
Oh, gosh.

794
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:21,341
I don't... I wouldn't even know

795
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:23,426
how you would begin to
fight something like that.

796
00:40:23,428 --> 00:40:27,247
That's a whole nother level

797
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:30,484
of what the [bleep] do you do with that.

798
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,122
Now,
is this something they can put a stop to,

799
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,290
or is it something that
they just kind of manage it?

800
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,693
They kind of manage it.

801
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:44,598
What I would recommend is keeping a journal

802
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,802
and kind of just documenting,
like, any dreams you have,

803
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,770
or any further experiences,

804
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:53,740
so that you have as much
recall as possible.

805
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:58,354
And it's really up to you
how you want to handle this.

806
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:01,304
It's not gonna be something
that's on a regular basis.

807
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:02,669
That would be highly unusual.

808
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,534
So you can live with it.

809
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:05,800
How do you feel, Jess?

810
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:07,167
I mean, you're the one
that's the main focus

811
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:08,168
of what's going on.

812
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:12,841
I didn't really want to believe

813
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:15,643
that it was something
from another dimension

814
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,744
or anything like that,

815
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:20,545
but I have no choice but to
believe what Amy tells me

816
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,514
and to do what she tells me to do.

817
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:25,687
To me, this sounds pretty simple,

818
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:28,487
as far as getting rid of
the spirits that are here

819
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,362
and knowing that we can
prevent any more coming in.

820
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,897
The other we'll just have
to tackle as a family,

821
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,269
as we do other things, and
we'll work through it somehow.

822
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:44,274
I honestly feel hat God gives us the tools

823
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:46,744
to do whatever we need to do.

824
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:48,079
He led us to y'all.

825
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:53,450
I wish I had better news
for Jeff and his family,

826
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:56,553
as dealing with alien
activity can be terrifying.

827
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,123
But I believe if they follow my advice,

828
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,858
they'll be able to manage it,

829
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,628
and with the help of a medium,

830
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,598
the dead will no longer
torment them in their home.
