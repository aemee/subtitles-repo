1
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:15,168
She's losing blood...

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,169
We're terrified.

3
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,503
I don't even want to come home.

4
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:18,872
He would kill people.

5
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:21,291
They found a mutilated body
with a large amount of blood.

6
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:23,509
Her neck got broken.

7
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,878
I can't protect my kids.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,512
They don't have answers.

9
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:29,816
People crawling on the floor towards them.

10
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:32,552
It's bad in here.

11
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,988
Something bad's going to happen.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,257
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,025
There's panic.

14
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,460
And it's almost like a butchering.

15
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,527
I see dead people.

16
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:43,663
They all died horribly.

17
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,365
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,766
Get out of here.

19
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:48,401
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,436
Vicious.

21
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:53,573
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,275
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

23
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:56,843
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,478
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

26
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:02,081
This guy's a real piece of work.

27
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,752
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,253
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

29
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:08,421
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:10,690
This is not good.

31
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,425
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,460
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:16,229
Until the very end...

34
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,697
I want my life back.

35
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,899
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,701
Is he trying to kill her?

37
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:22,969
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,470
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,172
This is going to kill us.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,473
I'm in Struthers, Ohio.

41
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,125
It's a small city right next to Youngstown.

42
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:49,696
I got called by a woman who
sounded desperate and alone.

43
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:50,897
She said something in the house

44
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,900
is attacking her and her two kids.

45
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:56,352
Making matters worse,
her husband doesn't believe her.

46
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,871
She told me she's got
no place else to turn.

47
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:13,353
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:16,622
I need to make sure the home
is clear of any personal items

49
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:21,260
or family photographs that
may influence her findings.

50
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:23,129
When I'm finished,

51
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,548
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:42,982
Right away,
I'm seeing a few mutilated people.

53
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:45,018
They are chopped up.

54
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,256
And there's pieces of a
person coming together,

55
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,625
and they form a woman.

56
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:58,498
And she is, like, begging to make it stop.

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,167
Then, a male comes up.

58
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,170
He's very well spoken, uh, educated.

59
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:07,173
- I think he was a doctor.
- Okay.

60
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:09,342
But he says that when he was alive,

61
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,844
he did do some things that were wrong.

62
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:13,846
And he had a very interesting,

63
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,100
I thought, reaction to the mutilated chick.

64
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,152
He was, like, "Ah."

65
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,489
I don't know what the
[bleep] happened to them.

66
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,532
So Joan,
after I talked to you on the phone,

67
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,268
I wanted to get here as soon as I could.

68
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,203
You sound like you're going through hell.

69
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,439
I'm just very grateful
that you guys are here.

70
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,875
We are living in a nightmare.

71
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,111
First, we started hearing noises.

72
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:47,947
Then, it went to things moving

73
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:50,316
to seeing shadow figures.

74
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,453
Then, it started getting physical.

75
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,570
Geez.

76
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:55,621
What year did you guys move in here?

77
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:56,823
2005.

78
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:00,042
You live here with...

79
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:03,546
My son Dalton, my husband John,

80
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:06,282
and my daughter Delani.

81
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:10,970
When it gets to the point
where I can't protect my kids,

82
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,989
that's where I draw the line.

83
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:14,657
You look like a happy family in this photo.

84
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,310
- No.
- Okay.

85
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,761
We're not happy now.

86
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:21,380
- There's been no support.
- In what sense?

87
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:25,118
My husband not believing me,
not believing my daughter,

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,819
not believing my son.

89
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:29,989
It's tearing the marriage apart.

90
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,875
So it's you and the kids against
whatever is in this house,

91
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,293
and your husband is out in left field

92
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:36,129
- somewhere with this whole thing?
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,931
Dalton was scratched on
the back of his neck.

94
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:42,001
Delani was scratched on her back.

95
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:46,022
I was pushed going down
to the basement one day.

96
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,391
And I do know the elderly woman

97
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:49,992
that lived here before we did,

98
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:52,411
they found her at the bottom
of the basement stairs.

99
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,147
Really? Was she dead?

100
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,033
- She died a couple days later.
- Okay.

101
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,018
It's taken a toll on my health.

102
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,924
I've been in the hospital
six times due to rib pain.

103
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:07,760
It feels like somebody is squeezing me.

104
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:09,595
What... what makes you
think this is paranormal

105
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,797
- and not just...
- The doctors are baffled.

106
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:17,036
They've done bone scans,
CAT scans, MRis, X-rays.

107
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,488
You name it, they've done it.

108
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,922
Okay, that's interesting.

109
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:23,125
I want to know who is here,
why they're here,

110
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,877
and I want them out.

111
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:31,817
I keep getting this wave of illness.

112
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,288
Uh, and it is very much in the stomach.

113
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,473
Uh, very nauseous.

114
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:41,027
It's almost like being
punched in the stomach.

115
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,098
Ugh. Geez, man.

116
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,803
There's a lot of stress in here.

117
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,339
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

118
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,841
The doctor, he didn't want to come in.

119
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,443
Aw, geez.

120
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,612
He's like,
"I shouldn't even be here anymore."

121
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:02,448
He's like, "Ah,
let's just get this over with."

122
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,325
- Okay. So, Joan, you sleep down here?
- Right.

123
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,860
- But it's unfinished, obviously.
- Correct.

124
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,829
And I'm assuming this is
also where you got pushed?

125
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,014
Yep.

126
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,700
I was coming down the stairs one day.

127
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:23,836
I got to the third step.

128
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:26,339
Felt a push on my back

129
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:30,142
and just crashed right
into this wall right here.

130
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,213
Did you have any laundry
or anything like that?

131
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,531
No.

132
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,866
So you couldn't have missed
a step by not seeing it.

133
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:37,984
No.

134
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,201
Okay. Did you tell your husband?

135
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:41,671
- No.
- Why?

136
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:44,090
I didn't think he would believe me.

137
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,491
Now, you told me the previous owner

138
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:48,261
fell down the flight of stairs,
and they found her here.

139
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,495
Right.

140
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:50,763
You think that's a coincidence?

141
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,031
I don't know.

142
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,516
Okay.

143
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:54,700
So, is that the only thing

144
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:56,636
- that's happened to you down here?
- No.

145
00:06:56,638 --> 00:07:00,006
I was laying in bed one night.

146
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:02,074
All of a sudden, the rib pain.

147
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,710
I open my eyes, and over here,

148
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,613
there's three shadow people.

149
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:11,684
And they're leaning over like this,
just looking at me.

150
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:13,452
Were you sleeping, and then got awaken...

151
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:17,456
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You okay?

152
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,541
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:19,659
No, no, no. Come here.

154
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,528
It's all right. It's all right.

155
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,929
I'm here. I believe you.

156
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,665
Okay?

157
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,135
It was the worst feeling in the world.

158
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,270
I couldn't sit up. I couldn't move.

159
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,089
I couldn't talk.

160
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:38,110
10 seconds later, it was just,
like, phew, they were gone.

161
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,946
Scariest thing I've ever encountered.

162
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,649
Okay.

163
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,442
Oh, my.

164
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:57,029
So now I'm seeing there's this dead female

165
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,065
and a living lady.

166
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:04,837
Dead lady, living lady have
some kind of attachment.

167
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,372
Interesting.

168
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:07,707
What?

169
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,611
So the dead lady is trying
to jump the living lady,

170
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:15,147
but the dead lady doesn't
know what she's doing.

171
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,916
So when she tries,

172
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,320
she kind of [bleep] up
the living woman's body.

173
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:25,858
Makes the living lady sick.

174
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,895
Like, cellular problems.

175
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,303
The living lady has experiences

176
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:40,506
when the dead lady is trying to jump her.

177
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:44,810
That's when she sees the
other [bleep] dead people.

178
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:48,514
I see, like, a person sitting up in bed

179
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:51,951
looking down this way and seeing,

180
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:55,254
like,
people crawling on the floor towards them.

181
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:04,630
And it's all the mutilated people.

182
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:07,066
Can't breathe, freaking out.

183
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,100
So, John, I was talking to
your wife about the things

184
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,369
that are going on here
and why she called us in.

185
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,687
It's got me concerned.

186
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,606
You guys have a pretty bad situation.

187
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:41,075
She seems to think that
you're not supportive

188
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:43,427
of what her and the kids are going through.

189
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:48,549
I believe them, but I don't have answers.

190
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:51,535
Have you had any experiences
at all that you can't explain?

191
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,121
There's one I know of that, you know,

192
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:57,024
Joan and I just kind of
didn't see eye-to-eye on.

193
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,788
It took place down in the basement.

194
00:09:58,888 --> 00:09:59,964
Okay.

195
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:04,923
And as we were speaking,
I seen this glare kind of like...

196
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:08,059
kind of swoosh and went this
way up towards the wall.

197
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,278
What did Joan think she saw?

198
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,798
She thinks she saw something paranormal.

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,834
So, what do you think you saw?

200
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:18,169
I feel it was a glare off of a car

201
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,839
and a glass block of where I was standing.

202
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:22,374
Okay.

203
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:24,175
So, you see where the problem is here

204
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,360
between you and your wife?

205
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:28,179
Yeah. It causes tension.

206
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,348
I... I don't deny it one bit.

207
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,017
Are you trying to not
accept what's going on here?

208
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,686
No, I've tried.

209
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:37,188
Um, there's times where
nobody has been home.

210
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,776
I've just sat in the living room,
you know, nothing on,

211
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:43,962
everything off, just sat.

212
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:48,349
Waited for a noise, a boom, anything.

213
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,735
I wish something would happen.

214
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,841
Because dead lady
all about taking over.

215
00:10:56,843 --> 00:11:00,111
You know, she wants a... a life back.

216
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,731
So this is why she's trying
to jump the living woman

217
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,416
who is here.

218
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:07,285
What would happen if she managed
to jump the living woman?

219
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:10,755
She would take over the
living woman's body,

220
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:15,260
and she would use it so
she could live again.

221
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:20,098
She would probably do
very bad things to men.

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,383
Do you have any idea
what she would do to men

223
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,502
if she managed to pull this off?

224
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:31,159
I think either she would torture
them or try to ruin their lives,

225
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,745
or possibly try to kill them.

226
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:41,753
So, Delani, uh,

227
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,254
- I talked to Mom today.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:46,691
And she told me about what
you guys are going through.

229
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,393
You're having a tough time, aren't you?

230
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,612
Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:54,149
It makes me really depressed.

232
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,734
- Like, the whole situation.
- Okay.

233
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,370
It'll make me cry a lot.

234
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:03,274
But I just don't tell anyone.

235
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:05,493
So, what kind of things
have you experienced?

236
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,928
When I lay in bed at night,

237
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,600
I see a shadow figure stand
outside my bedroom doorway.

238
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:13,968
Okay. Can you describe it to me?

239
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,222
It's tall, and it's very dark.

240
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:20,758
I can't see any facial
features or anything.

241
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,227
It's just black.

242
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:24,479
- Is it shaped like a person?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:26,564
Would you say it's a man or a woman?

244
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:31,035
I'd say a man because
it's larger than a woman.

245
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:33,104
Do you feel that this thing
is threatening, or...

246
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:35,139
I think it's trying to scare me.

247
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,975
Are you frightened to the point

248
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,743
you think it's gonna hurt you?

249
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:39,944
Yes.

250
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:41,846
So, honey, is there anything else going on?

251
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:45,884
I've had scratches on my lower back.

252
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,852
And can you describe the scratches for me?

253
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,889
Um, it was three scratches.

254
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:54,692
Like, a diagonal.

255
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,461
This one right here.

256
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
How did you notice that
the scratches were there?

257
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,034
Did you feel them, or...

258
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,335
Um, I went to sit down,

259
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:07,005
and it started burning.

260
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:10,675
Sometimes, I don't even want to come home.

261
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,794
It's scary here.

262
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,785
Oh.

263
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:25,423
The doctor guy likes it in here.

264
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,225
But to him, it's different.

265
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:30,678
It's more like an office.

266
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,765
He gets very angry when
people come in here.

267
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:41,389
I think that they see him
as a very tall darkness.

268
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:45,577
I don't like how he feels in here.

269
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,345
Uh. Oh.

270
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,251
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

271
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:10,628
Joan told me that the
previous owner of her house

272
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,832
died after falling down a flight of stairs.

273
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,918
I made some calls, and
the story checks out.

274
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I managed to track down
the victim's nephew,

275
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:20,755
and he said that wasn't the only tragedy

276
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,841
that his aunt suffered
while she lived there.

277
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,981
Mary was my aunt.

278
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:33,351
Uh, she married my uncle Nick.

279
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:35,620
They got married in 1937,

280
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:39,024
and here's a picture of their honeymoon.

281
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,109
Okay. So now, how did they wind up

282
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,695
on the property that
I'm investigating now?

283
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:46,231
- 1943, they bought the property.
- Okay.

284
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,932
And they lived there...

285
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,634
- Forever.
- Okay.

286
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,537
Until they passed away, yes.

287
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,540
Before we get to your aunt
Mary's accident in the house,

288
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,142
you mentioned that she
had some other tragedy.

289
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,209
What... what were you talking about?

290
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,178
Yes, uh, she lost her youngest son

291
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,963
which was, uh, Nick, Jr.

292
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,314
He was 35 years old.

293
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,250
He was killed in a motorcycle accident.

294
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,519
He was... he hit a guard rail.

295
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,522
And, uh, he was decapitated.

296
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:11,689
Geez. When did this happen?

297
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,692
Uh, it happened in 1973.

298
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,828
Can we talk about your aunt's accident?

299
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,912
Ah, yes.

300
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:19,931
My aunt was 95 years old.

301
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,534
- It happened in 2003.
- Okay.

302
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:25,570
My uncle Nick had already
passed away in 2001.

303
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:29,340
But she was alone,
living in the house by herself.

304
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,077
Apparently, she fell
down the basement step.

305
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,114
She laid there for three days,
uh, just barely alive.

306
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:39,584
The mailman noticed that
the mail was backing up,

307
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,586
and the neighbors would knock on the door.

308
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:44,072
So eventually, they called the police,
and they came in.

309
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,691
And when they got into the house,

310
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,710
they found her at the foot of the steps

311
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,295
in the basement barely alive.

312
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:54,165
Here is her obituary.

313
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,202
So this poor woman basically
laid there for three days.

314
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,387
Yes. One or two days after that,

315
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,972
she had passed away,

316
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:04,142
probably from her injuries from the fall.

317
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:09,364
What the hell?

318
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:17,188
I'm seeing a thing that looks
like a half-man, half-wolf.

319
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:23,311
It's growling. Grrr.

320
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:26,131
It doesn't seem human.

321
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:33,671
Um, it does something to the human body

322
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,140
when it's around.

323
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:39,777
It almost makes you lose your footing.

324
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,146
So it almost, like,

325
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:45,984
debilitates a person, makes you dizzy.

326
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:49,721
Fall down... likes to make you fall down.

327
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:52,590
And then, it does something to the heart

328
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:59,497
so it can take this energy
from the human heart.

329
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,367
So you feel very, very weak.

330
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,136
But its intention is not to kill.

331
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:09,174
Um, it likes to keep, like, a stash.

332
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:14,646
So far,
I've got a family living in fear

333
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:17,782
and a previous owner that died
after falling down the stairs.

334
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,317
But I still need to see
if there's anything else

335
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,819
that can help my case.

336
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,822
Searching through old records,
I find Thomas Struthers,

337
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,992
who is one of the original
owners of Joan's property.

338
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,395
Turns out he suffered a
lot in his time there,

339
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,231
losing not one but two adult children.

340
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,335
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

341
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:39,254
who promised to look into it for me.

342
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:46,711
This guy, Thomas Struthers,

343
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:49,080
what's his connection with the
property I'm investigating?

344
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:52,367
Well, he was born on your
client's property in 1803,

345
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,702
and his father was Captain John Struthers,

346
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,287
the founder of the city.

347
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,023
And then, when he turned 17 in 1820,

348
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,743
he went to college, became an attorney.

349
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:05,430
And in 1831 he got married to Eunice Eddy.

350
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,232
Okay, so now, I know from the research

351
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,833
I did that he lost two adult kids.

352
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,635
- Yes, he did.
- What was the story with that?

353
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,704
Here is the family portrait.

354
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,107
That's Thomas and Eunice.

355
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,359
And then, this is Thomas, Jr.,

356
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,894
and that's Anna.

357
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,813
In 1871, Thomas, Jr.

358
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:25,750
Contracted typhoid fever at the age of 27.

359
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,002
He was having dinner that night,

360
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,654
said he didn't feel well.

361
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,756
And by 4:00 a.m., he was dead.

362
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,391
What a shame. Okay.

363
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:34,592
So now, what about Anna's death?

364
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:38,296
In 1880, she ended up getting severely ill.

365
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,032
She dies of what they call consumption,

366
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:44,135
and she was 32 years old.

367
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:46,371
Okay. So, when does Thomas die?

368
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:50,041
Thomas dies in the year of 1892.

369
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,260
He was 89 years old.

370
00:18:55,348 --> 00:19:00,485
The doctor guy, he's very dramatic.

371
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:07,191
How... how he expresses
himself is direct and honest.

372
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:12,530
I think he is a perfectionist.

373
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:16,434
I think he died from a heart attack.

374
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:19,871
So there's something a little weird.

375
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:23,558
So the doctor guy is talking about Ed Gein,

376
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,811
who was a serial killer.

377
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,246
And I think when his mom died,

378
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,581
that's when he went crazy.

379
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:36,888
And he... he would kill people,
and he would, like,

380
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,557
use their skin to make [bleep] stuff.

381
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,213
There's something with this,
and it's really agitating me.

382
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,960
During my research,
one other thing caught my attention...

383
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:08,796
Three chopped-up bodies
found in rail road box cars.

384
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,499
And the train's last stop

385
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,252
was less than a mile from
John and Joan's house.

386
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,770
Now, this may be a long shot,

387
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,438
but I've reached out to
a local police captain

388
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,941
so he can tell me all
about this unsolved crime.

389
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:29,717
Cap, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

390
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,519
Reason I called you is
because of the article

391
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,521
I came across about the
three chopped-up bodies

392
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,639
in the box cars.

393
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,691
Were they found here in Struthers?

394
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,559
No, they were found in Pennsylvania.

395
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,695
Um, but it was determined
that they had been

396
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,299
sitting in our Struthers
yard for several months.

397
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,933
And I'm pretty close to
my client's property.

398
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:47,135
It's less than a mile from here.

399
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,536
Yes.

400
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,871
Okay. Take me through what happened.

401
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,939
May 3, 1940,

402
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:55,476
rail road inspectors ran
across a rail road car.

403
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,646
And when they opened it up,
they found a mutilated body.

404
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,249
The body was cut up into
seven different pieces.

405
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:04,002
They immediately then called
the police department, you know,

406
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,670
to start an investigation.

407
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:08,990
This was the first box car
where they found the first body.

408
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:10,291
So, the bodies weren't together

409
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:11,376
when they found the first one?

410
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:13,127
No... no, they weren't. Three box cars

411
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:16,264
down from the first one,
they found a second body.

412
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,598
He was stripped down naked,

413
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,019
and there was the word "Nazi"
carved into his chest.

414
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,637
They also determined it was a large amount

415
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:23,771
of blood near the body,

416
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:26,090
and they determined that that victim

417
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,675
was murdered in that box car.

418
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,928
The victim was a James
David Nicholson, okay?

419
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,681
He was originally from Chicago.

420
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,334
Moved down the line a little bit farther.

421
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,670
And by that picture,
they found a third body,

422
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,788
which they determined to be a female.

423
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,658
She was also mutilated
similar to the first body

424
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,726
that they found.

425
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:47,929
Wow.

426
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,767
The dead lady who hates men is
dragging herself up the stairs.

427
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,602
What the [bleep] happened to her ass?

428
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,221
Is this before she died?

429
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:59,240
The angry woman is showing me the events

430
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,943
that led up to her death.

431
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,112
And it's incredibly gruesome.

432
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,783
Someone is after her.

433
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:13,187
She's trying to get away.

434
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:16,290
Oh, she's frickin' [bleep]

435
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:24,615
She's young, um, 30, 40 maybe.

436
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:27,068
She hasn't been dead that long.

437
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,153
You know, 50 years.

438
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,394
Her head is pounding.
Her heart is pounding.

439
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,415
I feel like she's losing blood.

440
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,734
Someone is on her.

441
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:51,159
I think it's a male.

442
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,794
I don't feel very well.

443
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,730
She can't breathe. She can't breathe.

444
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:59,066
She's talking about her neck got broken.

445
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:05,773
So, what do we know about the victims?

446
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,391
They were all vagrants.

447
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,060
So this guy was going
after people that nobody

448
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,344
- really cared about.
- Yeah.

449
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,096
I mean, this screams
serial killer, obviously.

450
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,748
We determined it might be part

451
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,585
of what they called The
Mad Butcher of Cleveland...

452
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,387
- Okay...
- which was an ongoing investigation

453
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:20,872
of a serial killer.

454
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,590
Did they put a number on...

455
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:23,925
as to how many he might have killed?

456
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:26,394
There's been said it's been upwards of 50.

457
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:30,798
These victims they credit as
being number 22, 23 and 24.

458
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,216
Did they ever have any evidence

459
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,551
or any clue who might have did this?

460
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:35,620
One thing that was all
similar to all the bodies

461
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,655
was how precise it was done.

462
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:39,340
They said the person that did this

463
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:40,508
really knew what he was doing.

464
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,493
- So either a doctor or a butcher.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,712
Did they ever bring anybody
in to question them?

466
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,264
I believe they brought several people in,

467
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:49,133
but they were never able
to pin this on anybody.

468
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,885
Okay.

469
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,960
More of the messed-up
dead people are over here.

470
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:02,096
There's a handful of them

471
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:07,768
just kind of gauging the amount
of body parts and whatnot.

472
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,738
They were struggling and struggling.

473
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,374
And then, it ended like this,
so it's, like, all [bleep]

474
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:14,425
We had [bleep] lives.

475
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,227
And then, we died in a horrible way,

476
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:19,096
and it sucks.

477
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:24,252
And I am seeing, maybe, a rail road.

478
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,120
Like, I'm hearing that.

479
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:29,423
So I don't know if it was a train accident.

480
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,297
I don't know if they were on the train.

481
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,834
It doesn't seem like they were on it.

482
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:44,405
Whatever it was,
it was not handled properly at all.

483
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:48,309
And that's why these
people are not at rest.

484
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,744
They're freaking out. They're upset.

485
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:54,115
That's what I'm hearing,
is the right people need to pay.

486
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,174
I saw several dead people during my walk,

487
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,693
but the mutilated bodies
surrounding the living woman

488
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:08,095
had me the most concerned.

489
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:09,397
It was in the basement.

490
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:14,802
What she saw was all of
these people on the floor,

491
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,971
crawling towards her.

492
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,123
Some of them were missing limbs,

493
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,876
some of them, it was just their head.

494
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:24,345
They were all mutilated.

495
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:26,180
Bloody, pretty gory.

496
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:32,219
Is that what you saw?

497
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:34,422
Yes, that's what I saw.

498
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:55,995
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

499
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:57,363
we're ready to reveal our findings

500
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:02,418
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

501
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,453
Amy, you're looking at a couple in crisis.

502
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,022
Um, this is John and Joan.

503
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,426
They live here with their two kids.

504
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:11,961
This is Dalton, who is 13.

505
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:15,331
This is Delani,
who will be turning 17 very shortly.

506
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,432
Now, everybody in the house

507
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:19,101
is having experiences except for John.

508
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:21,971
And that's causing a little bit of tension

509
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,522
within their relationship.

510
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:26,342
Joan called us in because she's
scared for herself and the kids

511
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:30,012
and for her marriage.

512
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:31,480
She wants to know what the hell is here

513
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,666
and how to get rid of it.

514
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,302
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

515
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,621
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

516
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:40,723
Okay.

517
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:45,911
When I got here, I saw a lot of people

518
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:48,297
that were mutilated.

519
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,267
They were, like, chopped up or something.

520
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,837
There was, like,
moaning and crying going on.

521
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:58,657
And then, this woman kind of,
as much as she could,

522
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,743
put herself back together.

523
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,244
One of the things that she told me

524
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:06,799
was that they had had awful lives anyways.

525
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:09,418
And then, they died horribly.

526
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,321
And then, I was seeing train tracks.

527
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:15,791
I also got a lot of anger
from these people,

528
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:20,112
and they were saying how what
happened was not their fault

529
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:26,669
and that the proper people
have to, uh, pay for it.

530
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,238
That's some pretty interesting
stuff you uncovered.

531
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,041
I did some research on a case.

532
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,342
Back in May of 1940,

533
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:35,944
a group of rail road
workers in Pennsylvania

534
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,747
found a badly decomposed and mutilated body

535
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:39,748
in a rail road car.

536
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,351
Oh.

537
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,353
So, when the inspectors
went out to the box car,

538
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:47,556
they found a body that was chopped up

539
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:49,291
- into seven pieces...
- Mm.

540
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,477
That was wrapped in a burlap bag.

541
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:55,931
And they found two more
victims in separate box cars.

542
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,183
Now, you may be wondering why
I'm telling you about bodies

543
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:00,736
that were discovered in Pittsburgh.

544
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:04,773
These trains had been in
Struthers for several weeks,

545
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:08,544
and they're pretty sure that the
bodies were here decomposing.

546
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:13,015
That rail road yard is less
than a mile from your house.

547
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:15,284
Now, they believe this
was the work of a guy

548
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:16,819
they call the Cleveland Butcher.

549
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,921
- Okay.
- This guy was never caught,

550
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:21,957
and they're pretty sure
he killed up to 50 people.

551
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,792
Now, you said the... the...
the victims said

552
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,011
- they had terrible lives, right?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,596
Well, these were all hobos and...

554
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:31,683
and basically street people
that were being murdered.

555
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,969
I got one of the police reports.

556
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:39,391
And one of the other clues
was the precision of the cuts.

557
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,692
They thought it may have been a doctor.

558
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,216
To this day, this case is still open.

559
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:48,884
Oh.

560
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:50,219
- Interesting.
- Okay.

561
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,488
So this is what you might have seen.

562
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,857
Well, I might have been duped again.

563
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,192
I'm pissed. Okay.

564
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,393
What do you mean?

565
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:02,831
The first guy that I
really was involved with,

566
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,984
he was extremely articulate,
very well educated.

567
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:09,371
He stated that he was a doctor.

568
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,474
At first, I kind of had an...
an affinity for him.

569
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:16,378
But that began to change when
he started acting strangely.

570
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,249
When I was outside with
the mutilated woman,

571
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,717
he looked at her.

572
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,654
And then, he, like, went like, "Ah,"

573
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:28,490
which I thought was very
strange at the time.

574
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:30,526
But now that I think about it,

575
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:33,395
something definitely was off about him.

576
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,681
And now I'm just realizing.

577
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:38,100
Holy [bleep]

578
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,390
And then, I went up to the
back bedroom upstairs.

579
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:47,709
That's Delani's room, I think.

580
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,145
He thinks that room is his office.

581
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:53,665
He doesn't want any living
people in his space.

582
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,767
It really agitates him.

583
00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:01,373
And then, I did see that he
would possibly be seen as,

584
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:05,861
like, a shadowy figure.

585
00:30:05,863 --> 00:30:09,331
Explain to Amy how she sees
a dark shadow in her room.

586
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,200
She'll be laying in bed.

587
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,735
And sometimes, she'll look at her doorway,

588
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:16,171
- and he'll be standing there.
- Okay.

589
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:19,491
She has seen him multiple times.

590
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,809
The scratches Delani has.

591
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,946
I got a photo here I want to show you.

592
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,647
This is on her lower back.

593
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,382
- You took this photo, correct?
- Yeah.

594
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:30,102
Oh, my gosh.

595
00:30:30,104 --> 00:30:33,755
Could this doctor do that to her?

596
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,958
I think it's possible, yeah.

597
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,000
So, what else did you see?

598
00:30:45,002 --> 00:30:47,636
I went out into the backyard,

599
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,874
and I saw this weird dead person.

600
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:55,210
He was, like, half-man and half-wolf.

601
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:59,014
He does feed off the
energy of the human heart.

602
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,482
It's almost like a battery to him.

603
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,252
So he gets, like, charged up.

604
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:06,154
He likes to make people become, like, numb,

605
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,558
so they lose their legs
kind of out from under them.

606
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,261
Um, and that way, it disables them.

607
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:14,830
They'll fall down, and
he can try to, like,

608
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,765
get as much energy from the heart.

609
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:19,101
But his goal isn't to kill anybody

610
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:22,421
because that's his, like, food source.

611
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,555
You might as well tell her, Joan,

612
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:26,391
what happened to you with the stairs.

613
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:29,528
The first time I fell down the stairs,

614
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,613
my legs went out from under me.

615
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:34,816
The second time, I was pushed.

616
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:37,486
Wow.

617
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,077
Four years ago, she had a heart attack.

618
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,495
Really?

619
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,997
Oh, yeah.

620
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:51,984
I was down in the basement,
and I felt like I...

621
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:53,969
I couldn't breathe.

622
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,805
And it just felt like the life
was getting sucked out of me,

623
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:59,274
and I couldn't get up.

624
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:00,842
Oh, my gosh.

625
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:02,544
How come you didn't tell me about that?

626
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,080
I didn't know that that would have anything

627
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:06,481
- to do...
- Right.

628
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,333
With what was going on with the house.

629
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:11,737
Nobody knew.

630
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:14,273
Nobody but him and my kids.

631
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,458
Did you ever have any heart
issues before you moved here?

632
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
- No.
- No.

633
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:22,347
I knew it.

634
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,703
The interesting part is that
Joan isn't the only person

635
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,705
to take a bad fall down those steps.

636
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,975
The previous homeowner,
a woman named Mary Vlosich,

637
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:34,826
she was 95 years old.

638
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:38,380
And in 2003, the neighbors
noticed that she wasn't around

639
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:40,615
and her mail was not being taken in.

640
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:42,484
So, when the police finally came,

641
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:44,586
uh, they found Mary Vlosich at the bottom

642
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,072
- of the basement staircase...
- Wow.

643
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:49,424
Where she laid for almost three days.

644
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,760
This is her obituary.

645
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,996
She died a couple days later

646
00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:55,998
from the injuries that she
sustained during the fall.

647
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,733
Now, she's 95. You figure, all right.

648
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,434
She... she fell.

649
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,902
But I talked to the nephew.

650
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:04,506
Apparently, even at that age,
she was independent and sharp.

651
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:06,024
I just find it interesting that she falls

652
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,777
down the same staircase
that you fall down twice.

653
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:09,845
Right.

654
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:11,346
Interesting.

655
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,048
You still skeptical?

656
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,202
My wheels are turning.

657
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,608
There's another person that I encountered,

658
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,961
and this woman is the one

659
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,563
who is causing the most problems here.

660
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:31,233
She was crawling up the stairs.

661
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,834
I saw a lot of blood.

662
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,936
Then, when she was up in the hallway,

663
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:37,956
I saw that somebody broke her neck,

664
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:42,177
and that is probably what killed her.

665
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,030
Her murderer was a male.

666
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:48,884
And now she really dislikes men a lot.

667
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:53,321
She expressed the desire for,
you know, all men to die.

668
00:33:57,194 --> 00:34:02,431
But then, I went down to the basement,

669
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:07,686
and she, uh, was there.

670
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:10,839
And she's very focused on a living woman.

671
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:15,444
Um, there's some kind of attachment there.

672
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:18,780
And what the dead woman is actually doing

673
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:21,216
is trying to jump you,

674
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,652
which is trying to take over your body.

675
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:27,472
But she's also very bad at it.

676
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:31,793
So this can cause, uh, you to be sick.

677
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:38,483
It can cause cellular issues,
possibly causing tumors.

678
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:40,235
Oh, God.

679
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:46,041
I've been in the hospital how many times?

680
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,442
Five, six.

681
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:50,712
Nobody can figure out what's
going on in your ribs.

682
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,348
The only answer that we ever get is,
it's all inflamed.

683
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,816
All her ribs are inflamed.

684
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:56,067
Or her gall bladder is inflamed.

685
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,936
Her intestines are inflamed.

686
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:01,373
But they'll shrug their shoulders,
don't know.

687
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,825
The pain is just so bad.

688
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:07,512
I told my husband.
I said, "All's I want to do

689
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:09,764
is just have another heart
attack and be done with this.

690
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:10,966
I can't do it no more."

691
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:14,002
Uhh...

692
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:21,910
So the... the other thing is,

693
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:27,115
any time the dead woman was
around the living woman,

694
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:32,287
it would trigger her to open and,
like, see things.

695
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,757
Like what?

696
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,092
So I had a sketch done

697
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:42,430
of what I think she sees when she's in bed.

698
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:53,925
Are you ready for this?

699
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:25,058
So I had a sketch done

700
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,478
of what I think she sees when she's in bed.

701
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,488
Are you ready for this?

702
00:36:56,508 --> 00:37:00,193
She's woken up and seen
shadows around her bed.

703
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:03,213
And I've been telling you,
"This house is making me sick,

704
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:05,081
and I hate the basement."

705
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,916
I've been telling you, "It's the house.

706
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:11,604
It's the house. It's that [bleep] house."

707
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:15,909
Why are they around my bed?

708
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:19,245
What do they want? They want help.

709
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:24,100
What I've seen is when
someone kills someone

710
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:25,652
and they're still alive,

711
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:30,256
those people that that person murdered wait.

712
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:33,193
They're always around that person.

713
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:38,231
When that person dies,
the victims are there.

714
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,799
Waiting on the person who killed them.

715
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,234
Yes.

716
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,872
So it's my belief that
this dead woman is here

717
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:48,408
because you have abilities.

718
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:56,282
And that's what attracted her to you.

719
00:37:56,284 --> 00:38:00,854
Unfortunately, this dead woman, I believe,

720
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:05,692
was a victim of this serial-killing doctor.

721
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:08,344
And due to that, um,

722
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:14,267
she has this attachment to him
as well as many other victims.

723
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:17,587
So they're all webbed together.

724
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,941
So what the dead lady would like to do

725
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:24,194
is take over your body

726
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:28,147
so that she can be essentially alive again.

727
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:35,154
What would she be able
to do if she did that?

728
00:38:35,156 --> 00:38:37,290
There would be aggressive behavior,
probably,

729
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,592
towards the men in the household.

730
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,494
She would probably try to torture the men

731
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:43,530
in the household.

732
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:46,182
You know, she wants men to die.

733
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:52,705
Well, after our investigation,
we learned two things.

734
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,641
You're not crazy,

735
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:58,127
and you and your son may be in danger.

736
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,346
But we still haven't
answered the big question.

737
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,365
Can you get whatever is here the hell out

738
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:04,951
and live a normal life
with your family again?

739
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:09,589
For that, I'm going to turn
it over to my partner, Amy.

740
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:13,209
The situation here is
that it's not the house.

741
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:18,164
It's the unfortunate proximity
to some of these murders.

742
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,332
I want an individual

743
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:22,936
who is a male and who practices witchcraft

744
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:25,655
to do a ritual to push out the dead.

745
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,625
And then, I want him to do a blessing.

746
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,294
So once the witch comes in
and pushes the dead out,

747
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:32,712
where are they going to go?

748
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:36,583
They're going to go
outside of the perimeter.

749
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:42,472
They want the doctor to be brought forward

750
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:45,842
and to pay for what he did to them.

751
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,361
Now, of course, him being deceased,

752
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:52,949
the only way that he
can kind of pay for this

753
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:56,202
and they can find vindication

754
00:39:56,204 --> 00:40:01,708
is that the public knows
this person was in fact bad.

755
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,228
After that, I want the witch
to take this tar water

756
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,646
and take a dropper

757
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:11,301
and put one drop in the
center of each room,

758
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:16,389
then to go outside and do the
perimeter of the property.

759
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:21,027
And just a drop every,
you know, several feet.

760
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:24,998
No dead are going to
come in and bother you.

761
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,568
So, once the witch comes in and does this,

762
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,003
she'll feel better?

763
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,471
Oh, yeah.

764
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,505
All the stuff that...

765
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:33,506
The shadow figures they're seeing?

766
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:34,874
Right.

767
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,109
Sounds like you're going to be okay.

768
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:44,767
He wasn't believing,
and I thought I was going crazy.

769
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:49,789
This is happening to her.

770
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,660
You have to respect that
and just be compassionate.

771
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,361
Just be there with love.

772
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:56,829
At the same time,

773
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,233
you have to respect that and be like,
"That's who he is.

774
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:02,435
He's not having this experience.

775
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:05,104
He can't see what I'm going through."

776
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:08,775
So, you have to meet in the middle.

777
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:11,027
When I'm up all night

778
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:14,981
being agitated sometimes by this

779
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:16,416
and I don't sleep all night

780
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:18,885
and I'm thinking I'm crazy at the time,

781
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:22,005
just tell me it's going
to be okay and just...

782
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:25,058
just hug me, and that's it.

783
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,627
I... I know you don't understand
because you don't see it.

784
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:32,382
I know that, but just believe
me because I'm your wife.

785
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:33,466
I do. I believe you.

786
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:35,184
Just believe... you believe me now.

787
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:37,937
No. I've always believed you.

788
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,606
Are you going to contact a
male witch and get this done?

789
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,175
Absolutely, I am.

790
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:43,309
Okay.

791
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,511
I mean, whatever it takes.
Because, I... I mean,

792
00:41:45,513 --> 00:41:47,947
I want everything back the way it was.

793
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:53,052
With all of the dead
inside this location,

794
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:56,923
Joan and John have their
work cut out for them.

795
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:58,975
But I believe that if they work together,

796
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,394
they'll be able to free
themselves of the evil

797
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,196
that's tormenting their family.
