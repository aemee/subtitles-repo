1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,889
Something kills people here.

2
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:15,861
Lots of pain.

3
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:18,466
This isn't normal.
There's something going on.

4
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,805
Really strong.

5
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:24,581
Something's grabbing my arm and hurting me.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,253
And then, she's screaming.

7
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:30,762
He was classified as insane.

8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,637
This is not good.

9
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:36,042
They're being tortured.

10
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,715
Something bad's going to happen.

11
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:41,621
My name is Amy Allan.

12
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,990
There's panic.

13
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,425
And it's almost like a butchering.

14
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:45,495
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:47,633
They all died horribly.

16
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:49,337
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:50,741
Get out of here.

18
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,376
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:54,415
Vicious.

20
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:57,563
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,268
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,836
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:02,473
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:04,376
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

25
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,079
This guy's a real piece of work.

26
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:09,755
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:11,258
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,426
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,699
This is not good.

30
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,437
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,473
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,242
Until the very end.

33
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:21,713
I want my life back.

34
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,185
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:25,788
Is he trying to kill her?

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,057
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,728
Oh, my god.

38
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,065
This is going to kill us.

39
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:46,072
I'm in the small town of Falconer,
New York.

40
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:47,941
It's about an hour south of Buffalo.

41
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,914
I received a call from a woman named Sheila.

42
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,688
She said there's something
very wrong in her new home.

43
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,560
The activity is nonstop, and it's violent.

44
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:58,266
Everybody in the house is living in fear.

45
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:01,003
But Sheila says her 14-year-old daughter is

46
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,504
getting the worst of it.

47
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,741
She says she may be in grave danger.

48
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,086
Before Amy arrives,

49
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:16,458
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

50
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,727
Once all the family photos

51
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,832
and personal items are covered or removed,

52
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,536
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

53
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,264
Oh, boy.

54
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,873
I'm getting lots of anger and drugs.

55
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,278
Someone is sick.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,282
Currently?

57
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:52,885
It feels like it.

58
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,991
Lots of pain.

59
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,801
Ugh, this person is a disaster.

60
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,210
Sheila, when we spoke on the phone,

61
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,011
I know you were upset,

62
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:16,549
and it sounds like you've
got a problem here.

63
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,187
Tell me a little bit about what's going on.

64
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,193
It seems like something
is targeting my daughter.

65
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:24,430
It's very hard for her to be here.

66
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,366
She doesn't want to be here.

67
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,635
There's nothing I can do to protect her

68
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,838
'cause I don't know what's going on.

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,108
I mean, she's having experiences every day.

70
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,743
She's having a lot of stomach issues,

71
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,914
and the doctors can't find
anything wrong with her.

72
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,016
At one point, she had bruises on her hand

73
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,985
that looked like somebody grabbed her.

74
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:46,687
And that was really what prompted me

75
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:49,653
to try and find somebody to help us.

76
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:52,894
So, who exactly is living in the house?

77
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:56,229
That's my husband, George.

78
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,200
- This is my daughter, Sara.
- Sara?

79
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:01,406
And that's my 15-year-old son, Nathan.

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,774
Okay.

81
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,775
We've all had experiences.

82
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,111
Okay.

83
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,148
There's all kinds of noises in the house.

84
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,915
We have a lot things that
just come up missing.

85
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,953
My back has been worse than it's ever been.

86
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,356
Now, what kind of back pain
are you talking about?

87
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,524
Severe, stabbing pain,

88
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,126
where sometimes it takes your breath away.

89
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,228
And now it's to the point where, you know,

90
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,063
I'm going to different doctors,
having injections,

91
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:31,567
and taking medication just
so that I can basically do

92
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:32,501
what I need to do.

93
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:36,003
This isn't normal.
There's something going on.

94
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,378
A lot of pain,
a lot of pain, physical pain.

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,547
Somebody is [bleep] in
a lot of [bleep] pain.

96
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:54,420
It's really bad back pain,
like super [bleep] bad.

97
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:08,394
First, I have no idea how
anybody [bleep] lives here.

98
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:15,569
I don't know how they sleep.
I don't know how they eat.

99
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:19,973
I don't know how they can leave.

100
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,774
And just the physical pain

101
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:31,545
that I feel that they're
dealing with is ridiculous.

102
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,883
So, Sheila,
why did you bring me outside?

103
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,652
I see somebody walking up the steps.

104
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,554
And there's a couch right in there

105
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,456
where I sit at night,

106
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,560
and I'm thinking somebody's
coming to the door.

107
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:50,659
So, I'll get up and answer,
you know, go to the door,

108
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,095
and there's nobody there.

109
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:54,865
Can you make out any features at all,
like a face or anything.

110
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,966
No, it kind of happens really quick,

111
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,469
but it looks more like a shadowy figure.

112
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:03,909
Okay, so, have you ever seen
this figure anyplace else?

113
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,578
Yes, inside the house.

114
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,249
Okay, show me.

115
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,754
I was sitting on that same couch,

116
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,059
and I heard footsteps
coming down these stairs,

117
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,559
so I was looking to see who it was,

118
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,294
and I never heard the door open,

119
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:24,364
but, all of a sudden,
I saw that same shadowy figure,

120
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:27,563
like, look around the corner at me

121
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,667
and then came right back
towards this direction.

122
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,269
All right, so, you come to investigate,

123
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,971
and you're sure there was nobody down here?

124
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,069
I'm positive.

125
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,270
Okay, did you hear it go back up the steps?

126
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,141
No, I did not.

127
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,343
Okay.

128
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,812
And you definitely hear the door.

129
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:46,081
I got no explanation for it other
than what you're telling me.

130
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,116
What do you really hoping
for us to do for you?

131
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,885
Well, I'm hoping to be able to find out

132
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:53,419
whatever it is that's hurting Sara.

133
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,553
Just show us how or tell
us how we can get rid of it

134
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,022
so that we can have an everyday life,

135
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:01,859
she can stay here without having
to worry about being alone.

136
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,328
I don't know what else I can do.

137
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,131
Okay.

138
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,340
There's, like, this guy.

139
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,406
He's super-religious...

140
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:20,845
like<i> super-religious.</i>

141
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,178
Wow.

142
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:29,285
He wants everyone in this home to leave

143
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,557
because they are unclean.

144
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,891
So, you know,
he's haunting the [bleep] out of them.

145
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:39,893
What does he do?

146
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,062
He acts like a ghost.

147
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,200
Out of here, he will stomp.

148
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:47,705
Like, he'll...

149
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:55,477
He gives no privacy

150
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,413
and lets it be known there's no privacy.

151
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,917
So, Sara, I was talking to Mom earlier

152
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,922
about the stuff that's going on here.

153
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,525
And the reason I took this
case is because of you

154
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,258
and what she said you're going through.

155
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,559
She mentioned some physical problems.

156
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,628
What's happening?

157
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,730
Ever since we moved into this house,

158
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,231
I've had really bad stomach pains

159
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,199
that feel like someone's
stabbing me all the time,

160
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:27,038
and I've gone to like 10 doctors about it,

161
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,239
and none of them can
figure out what's wrong.

162
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,544
Is that the only physical
thing you're having, I mean?

163
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,881
I'll wake up at night,
and I'll be getting scratched,

164
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,381
and even the whole family,

165
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,318
like, says that it's centered around me.

166
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,623
These scratches that
you're getting, I mean,

167
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,257
how bad are we talking about?

168
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,625
What are they looking like?

169
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,626
They'll go away within three or four days,

170
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:48,562
but I've had some that have scarred over.

171
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,563
So I've had some bleeding.

172
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,498
Where do you generally get these scratches?

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,800
On my thigh and my lower back.

174
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,302
You have cats here. Yeah.

175
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:57,804
Are we pretty sure it's not that?

176
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,574
Yeah, 'cause I had them
before the cats were here.

177
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,709
Before the cats.

178
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,343
Anything else physical happening to you?

179
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,511
I've gotten bruises on my arm.

180
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,848
What kind of bruises?

181
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,015
Like,
something's grabbing my arm and hurting me.

182
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,082
It looked like four fingers going across,

183
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,150
and they were really big,

184
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:17,319
like,
probably two times the size of my hand.

185
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,321
- So, like a man's hands.
- Yes.

186
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:28,531
The religious guy,
he prefers a particular woman here.

187
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,899
I see him looming over her.

188
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:38,473
He can make physical contact.
Like, he just grabbed my head.

189
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:41,845
He was making it known
that he can touch me,

190
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,612
and it felt like a tingling
where his fingers would be,

191
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,116
like down into my brain even.

192
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:53,521
He gets super-big, smothering,
you know, trying to smother.

193
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:56,292
Pressure, panic.

194
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,428
The way that he smothers people is

195
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,228
he sticks his fingers in
their mouth and down their...

196
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,864
He makes people choke.

197
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,864
He's like, "This is chaos,

198
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,838
"and they need to fix
it and take care of it

199
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,612
and accept Jesus Christ,"
into, you know, their lives.

200
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:19,881
Okay.

201
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,592
Things going on all the time.

202
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,598
They're being tortured.

203
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,979
So, George, I was talking to Sheila,

204
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,746
and you guys are practically newlyweds,
right?

205
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:56,848
Yes.

206
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,286
But it seems like you can't even enjoy it.

207
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,818
No.

208
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,752
And I know you must be concerned for Sara,
as well.

209
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:05,188
Being the stepdad,
it's my job to protect the family,

210
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,026
and it just freaks me out

211
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,361
that I can't prevent
what's happening to her.

212
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,365
Do you ever experience anything?

213
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,040
On two occasions,
something was on the porch,

214
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,107
so got the flashlight,
and I took off toward the garage,

215
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:22,776
and whatever it was went into the garage.

216
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:26,714
Everything that was in
its way was pushed aside.

217
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:29,751
It makes the hair on the
back of my neck stand up

218
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:33,719
because if I can't catch
and if I can't see it

219
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,689
and if I can't stop it,

220
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,625
how can I stop it from
coming into the house?

221
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:40,694
So, George,
with all this stuff going on in the house,

222
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:42,396
have you tried any kind of...

223
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:44,999
get help here or anything like that?

224
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,634
One afternoon,
somebody stopped by the house,

225
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:49,838
and I'm like, "Excuse me. Can I help you?

226
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,507
Do you have the right house?"

227
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,678
And he says, "Yeah,
I'm from your wife's church."

228
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,784
He was wearing the old-style,
black-rimmed hat...

229
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,820
Okay.

230
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:04,126
And a full-length black jacket.

231
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,130
Like an old preacher type of thing?

232
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,067
Yes, exactly like an old preacher,

233
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,505
like from the early 1900s maybe.

234
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,705
So, he comes in,
and he checks out the house,

235
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,008
and he starts to make for the door.

236
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,777
I'm like, "Oh, hey, wait a minute.

237
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,945
You got anything to tell us?"

238
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,751
And he just looks at me
dead in the face and says,

239
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:23,919
"I can't help you."

240
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,521
Did you tell your wife what happened?

241
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:26,556
Yes, I did.

242
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:27,791
As soon as she came home, I told her.

243
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:31,128
I said, "Hey,
your friend from the church came."

244
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,197
And she says, "What friend?"

245
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:48,622
I would say that this is not
a very good area in the house.

246
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,624
This religious guy,

247
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:55,660
he doesn't like it up here, either.

248
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:59,534
It makes him agitated.

249
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:06,008
He thinks that there is
something evil here.

250
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,744
This is not good.

251
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,979
From his religious perspective,

252
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:17,481
it's, you know,
some kind of demon or something.

253
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,188
Something kills people here.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,498
So, when I was talking to Mom,

255
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,333
she mentioned that everybody's
having experiences in the house,

256
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,868
and I was wondering about you.

257
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,303
I used to sleep in this bed right here

258
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:38,437
and had a laptop there.

259
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,736
I would watch stuff before I went to sleep.

260
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,939
And I used to see eyes peering at me

261
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,705
through this door leading
into the bathroom.

262
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:45,972
Describe what it looked like.

263
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,373
It kind of just looked like

264
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,376
just two sets of balls that were red,

265
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,277
that were right next to each other.

266
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,879
Are you sure it's not something
you're looking at on your laptop

267
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,214
that's screwing your eyes up?

268
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,452
No, 'cause, I mean, I'm
trying to comprehend

269
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:59,690
what's going on and find
a way to just prove

270
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,658
that it's not, you know, paranormal.

271
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,195
Right,
and you're not coming up with any answers?

272
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,497
I haven't come up with
anything other than...

273
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:06,597
Yeah, nothing.

274
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,898
Okay, so, is there anything else going on?

275
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,299
Well, I have a few items go
missing for months at a time

276
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,866
that I've know I placed somewhere.

277
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,099
What kind of stuff?

278
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:17,735
It's been water bottles,
keys, a belt one time.

279
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:18,971
It's not there when you check,

280
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,339
and then you come back,
and it's in the spot.

281
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:22,408
Like, you know it was there before,

282
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,842
but you couldn't find it.

283
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,675
Are you having trouble going
to bed at night or sleeping?

284
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:28,177
Yeah, sometimes.

285
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:29,514
I've always had feeling
that somebody's watched me

286
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,348
from that corner ever since we moved in.

287
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,254
God.

288
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,559
It gets even worse in here.

289
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:50,696
There's something here that I'm missing.

290
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:54,534
And I'm gonna tell you that
it can [bleep] jump people,

291
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,734
get inside of people's bodies.

292
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,606
I don't think it's this religious guy.

293
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,175
It feels feminine.

294
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,775
This person's good.

295
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,542
They're [bleep] good.

296
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:08,145
Really strong.

297
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,250
She knows how to [bleep] hide.

298
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,251
She knows that I...

299
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,921
They're dangerous when they can...

300
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:15,823
[bleep] dangerous.

301
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:19,565
She makes people sick.

302
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:23,536
This is way deliberate,
<i>way</i> intentional.

303
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:24,837
Definitely.

304
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,581
And she messed people up.

305
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,119
Sheila and George didn't know anything

306
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,622
about the history of their property,

307
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,958
so I made few calls.

308
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,362
Turns out one of the original owners

309
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,664
had real bad go of things.

310
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,568
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

311
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,902
who says this story is filled

312
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:05,273
with heartbreak, insanity, and death.

313
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:16,844
What can you tell me
about the Southland family?

314
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:21,415
Jon and his wife, Jane,
purchased the property in 1869.

315
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:25,786
They had 75 acres of land,
and he was a farmer.

316
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:28,656
I have an 1881 atlas of Chautauqua County

317
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:31,392
which shows the property, the 75 acres.

318
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:35,496
Okay, Now, on the phone,
you said things were tough

319
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,099
for this family. What did you mean by that?

320
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,873
In 1880,
John and his wife were out one morning

321
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,474
- for a ride in their carriage.
- Okay.

322
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:45,444
And something spooked the horses,

323
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,449
and they veered very hard,

324
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:50,419
and it caused the carriage to topple over.

325
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,121
Jonathan apparently hit his head.

326
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:56,122
He managed to hold on to the reins,

327
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,523
but he was dragged behind the horses.

328
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:02,463
He managed to control them,
and he hitched them to a post

329
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:06,166
and went back to aid his
wife and dropped dead.

330
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:08,000
Wow.

331
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:12,139
He must have had some hit to the head.

332
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,575
So, I would assume that
Jane got the property then

333
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:14,909
once he passed.

334
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,645
No, at that time period,
a woman didn't automatically inherit

335
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:20,314
her husband's full estate
because there were children.

336
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:23,252
- Okay.
- They had two grown sons.

337
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,386
Martin was 31, and Charles was 25.

338
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:28,020
And they were the ones
who inherited the farm.

339
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,288
And so, what happens?

340
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,625
In 1883, Martin was committed

341
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:35,496
to a mental institution in Buffalo.

342
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:36,931
What was his issue?

343
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,503
His commitment was for
religious excitement.

344
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:41,536
What does that mean?

345
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,739
In the mid to late 1800s,

346
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:47,542
people were being exposed to spiritualism

347
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:52,344
and Mormonism and other new beliefs.

348
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:55,947
Perhaps his family was
concerned about that.

349
00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:00,053
Geez.

350
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,089
He was classified as insane.

351
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:11,434
This guy I met earlier,
he speaks funny.

352
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,974
He does. He speaks strange.

353
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,377
How?

354
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,381
Like old-fashioned.

355
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,792
This creepy religious guy is
suddenly opening up to me,

356
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,894
and I'm seeing glimpses of
what he was like in life.

357
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,231
I thought he was in his 60s, but, actually,

358
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,734
looking at him when he was healthy,

359
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,102
he might have been younger.

360
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,771
In his 50s, maybe, I'm thinking.

361
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:41,242
He's very skittish.

362
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,479
He's like, "Where are you going?

363
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,715
"Where are you going? What's up? What's up?

364
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:46,950
"Where are you going? Where are you going?

365
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:49,017
Okay, okay, okay, okay."

366
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:55,721
He was detained at some point in his life.

367
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:01,092
So, yeah, he had problems,
you know, with his family.

368
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:02,327
There were problems there.

369
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,794
Hmm.

370
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:09,964
He's okay with us knowing some
things but not everything.

371
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,369
So, now, what happens to him?

372
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:17,270
Well, he was discharged from
that commitment in 1883.

373
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:19,839
I don't know how long he was there in 1883,

374
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,008
but I found him in later census records

375
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,978
working in Buffalo as a shoemaker.

376
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,915
So, was he okay after that?

377
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,416
Well, he apparently wasn't,

378
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,882
because he ended up taking his own life.

379
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,653
He slit his own throat with a razor.

380
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,856
Geez.

381
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,394
Martin kills himself in 1909.

382
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,534
- He was 60 years old at the time.
- Right.

383
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,536
This is interesting... "An effort
is being made to find relatives."

384
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:47,703
Correct.

385
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:51,037
His brother's gone. His parents are gone.

386
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,371
He was pretty much alone.

387
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:03,609
He, uh, got really hurt, really bad.

388
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,279
He goes, "Then, it all just stopped."

389
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:13,049
Mmm...

390
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,451
He's like, "I was trying to...

391
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,587
I got to get to the church.
I got to get to the church."

392
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:22,926
Didn't work out that way.
Mm, they put him in the ground.

393
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:25,362
They just threw him in the ground.

394
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:35,474
But he's not angry anymore,
not angry anymore.

395
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:41,011
Now it's the sad. He's sad.

396
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,263
Now that I know a former
owner of Sheila and George's property

397
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,367
was committed to mental institution

398
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,438
and later committed suicide,

399
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,940
I need to see if there's anything else

400
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:03,142
that could help my case.

401
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:07,713
Searching through old records,
I come across the Crapo family

402
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:14,254
and find not one but four deaths
all inside my clients' house.

403
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,559
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

404
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:18,259
who says she's got information

405
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:19,695
that will definitely help my case.

406
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:30,509
So, in my research,
I came across the Crapo family

407
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:31,776
that lived on my clients' property.

408
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,879
What do you know about the family itself?

409
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:36,483
Well, Archie Crapo and his
wife and his four children

410
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:42,456
moved here from Kansas in 1931
during the Great Depression.

411
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,927
I saw that there was four
deaths inside the house.

412
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,429
What do you know about those?

413
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:50,599
By this time, Archie had moved
his ailing parents in with them.

414
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,433
The first death was Archie's mother

415
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,635
in January of 1948,

416
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,970
and she died of heart failure.

417
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,107
And this is her death certificate.

418
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,843
She was 88 years old.

419
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,111
Mm-hmm.

420
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,181
Well, less than a month later,
her husband dies.

421
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:09,054
His official cause of death
was heart failure, as well.

422
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,689
Was he around the same age?

423
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,690
I think he was about 96.

424
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:13,126
Wow.

425
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:14,829
So, what was the third death?

426
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,165
The third death happens in 1962...

427
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,033
Archie's wife, Carola.

428
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,368
After a long struggle with lung cancer,

429
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,271
she passes away in the house.

430
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:28,242
She was 67.

431
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:31,849
But what was the fourth one?

432
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, Archie sold the house to his son,
Joseph,

433
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,555
and his wife, Joyce, and their two kids.

434
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,057
Okay.

435
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,993
And soon after they moved her mother in,
Margaret Penticoff.

436
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:46,232
She passes away on February 1, 1975

437
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:49,300
of congestive heart failure in the house.

438
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:50,301
This is a photo of her?

439
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,772
This is a photo of her.

440
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:54,240
I mean, I know it's natural causes,

441
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,074
but, I mean, this house is like bad luck.

442
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,481
What the hell? There's some lady.

443
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:04,249
And they're flipping the [bleep] out.

444
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:11,924
Feisty, feisty,
and not happy that we're here,

445
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:18,563
and she's like spitting at
us and calling us names.

446
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,768
We'd probably maybe hear her yelling

447
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,804
or maybe see her quickly.

448
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,410
Any idea what time
period she might be from?

449
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,246
'70s or '80s.

450
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:37,086
The little old lady from outside,

451
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:39,619
she likes it in here.

452
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,689
She's vomiting.

453
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,823
I think she died here.

454
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,225
It was fast.

455
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,226
I don't know if it's her heart.

456
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,930
This is making me too sick.

457
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:04,973
It's not healthy for the living

458
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:09,911
to be in that area

459
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:14,047
because they are...

460
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,984
Absorbing that.

461
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,854
And that's very bad for them.

462
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:25,862
Look,
I don't know if this is gonna help my case,

463
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,364
but during my research,
one thing really caught my eye...

464
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,366
the murder of a pregnant girl

465
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,336
less than a mile from my client's house.

466
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,170
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police sergeant

467
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,273
who said this is one of
the most brutal murders

468
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,543
in the county's history.

469
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,982
The reason I called you is
I came across that article

470
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,520
about a 7-month-pregnant
female that was murdered

471
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:52,324
within less than a mile from my clients'
property,

472
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,325
and you were able to look into it for me.

473
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,225
Yeah, that's why I brought you here.

474
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,160
Just a couple hundred
yards up the riverbank is

475
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,494
where the woman's body was found.

476
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,663
Okay, so when did this happen?

477
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,366
It was September 23, 1899.

478
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,469
It was about 8:00 at night.

479
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,671
There was three boys that were
walking along the riverbank,

480
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,138
and they heard a woman screaming.

481
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,975
The three of them went down
to the edge of the riverbank,

482
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,843
and they found the woman facedown,

483
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,045
partially in the water.

484
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:19,151
They turned her over and
immediately noticed

485
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,753
that she was bleeding
severely from her neck.

486
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,391
Before the doctor could come, she had died.

487
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,793
Okay, now,
did they ever wind up identifying her?

488
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:28,762
Yes.

489
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:30,298
They identified her at the morgue

490
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,204
as 26-year-old Emily Adolphson.

491
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,806
She was a Swedish immigrant.

492
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:37,710
Her throat had been slit from
her chin to her spinal column,

493
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:38,445
and she bled to death.

494
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:39,713
Okay.

495
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:42,680
And they also determined that
she was 7 months pregnant.

496
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,021
So, did they have any idea
who might have done this?

497
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:50,325
She had a lover named Frank Vennerholm.

498
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,930
Now, did they go after this guy?

499
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:53,663
They go in the early morning hours,

500
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,034
and they go to his
residence to interview him.

501
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:59,037
They scour the apartment

502
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,103
just trying to look for some evidence.

503
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,838
They go into the closet,

504
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,775
and they find a pair of pants and a vest

505
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:07,409
that are covered in mud and blood.

506
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:10,080
And then, he gets arrested.

507
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:12,283
So, does it go to trial?
Does he get indicted?

508
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:14,720
- Yes.
- And so, how'd the trial go?

509
00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:17,423
They find Vennerholm guilty
for the murder of Emily.

510
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,025
Okay.

511
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:25,134
On July 16, 1901, Vennerholm was
executed in Auburn, New York.

512
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:27,037
Does this guy ever confess to anything?

513
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,438
He never confesses.

514
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,939
- Never?
- Never.

515
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,043
There's a woman.

516
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:34,043
She's crying.

517
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:36,245
There's a river, or, like, a stream.

518
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:39,246
Something about that and
something about her child.

519
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:41,980
Usually, she's down like this,

520
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,617
and she's like rocking, you know,

521
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,452
and she's like, "Aah," crying.

522
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,787
But then, she stands up,

523
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:50,256
and she becomes this big different,

524
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:55,196
totally different kind
of thing, uh, person.

525
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,764
I think that's, like, really,
like, her pain and everything,

526
00:26:58,766 --> 00:26:59,767
like, comes up like that.

527
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,771
And then, she's screaming.

528
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:09,408
If someone sees this happening,
it's not good for them.

529
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:21,051
I saw several dead people during my walk,

530
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,887
but the religious man
smothering a female in the house

531
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,955
has me the most concerned.

532
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:29,892
There was a female on the bed.

533
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:35,799
And there was a male there.

534
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:41,143
He would kind of make himself into a black,
thick mass.

535
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,449
Amy, is this what you saw?

536
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,718
Yes.

537
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,628
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

538
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,064
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

539
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,866
and our clients for the first time.

540
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,432
Amy, I'd like you to
meet George and Sheila.

541
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,400
This is their home.

542
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,435
They've owned it about two years.

543
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:24,704
Now, the activity's really bad here.

544
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:26,340
They actually live here

545
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:29,778
with Sheila's son, Nathan, who's 15.

546
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,679
This is Evan, who's 18,

547
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:33,014
who moved out about 10 days ago?

548
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,149
Mm-hmm.

549
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:35,383
And this is Sara, who's 14,

550
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,884
and she's the main reason we're here.

551
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,685
And she's a sweet kid,

552
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,151
and she's getting physically attacked.

553
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,921
They're desperate for help,
and that's why they called us.

554
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,326
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

555
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,995
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

556
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,601
When I first arrived,

557
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:55,202
I noticed this little old lady there,

558
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:59,071
and she was yelling at me from the garage.

559
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:02,176
Later on, in the house,

560
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:03,742
I encountered her in the kitchen,

561
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:08,143
and I saw her and felt
her become extremely ill,

562
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:10,413
like violently ill.

563
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,252
She was vomiting, extreme stomach pain.

564
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,921
It's like... I'm like,
"Maybe this is a heart attack."

565
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:20,787
She projects it out so intensely

566
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,789
that the living would absorb this,

567
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,491
and it would physically affect you.

568
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:32,968
So, I don't think it's good
for you to be in that area.

569
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,940
I do think that she died
possibly in the kitchen,

570
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,078
and fairly recently... '70s, '80s.

571
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,748
You know,
the one thing that really struck me odd

572
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,449
during the research for your property...

573
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,785
actually, the home itself...

574
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,856
was that four people actually
died right inside the house.

575
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,491
Oh, my.

576
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:54,394
- Three of them were women.
- Oh.

577
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:55,796
And all from the same family.

578
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,701
Now, who I think you may be
talking about is this woman.

579
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:02,135
This is Margaret Penticoff.

580
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:04,474
She died of congestive heart failure

581
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:08,311
in 1975 in the home.

582
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,711
Okay. How old was she when she died?

583
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,578
She was pretty young... 62.

584
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,515
Yeah, that looks like her.

585
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:17,251
The lips and the nose.

586
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,522
- It's a little disconcerting.
- Yeah.

587
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:25,556
Yeah,
that definitely might have put a difference

588
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,192
onto whether or not I would
have bought the house, honestly,

589
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,929
had I known.

590
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:39,439
The other thing was when
I got to the porch area,

591
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:43,077
I felt a lot of anger,

592
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,484
and this anger is actually
from a living person.

593
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:52,124
I felt that someone
who's living in the house

594
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:53,424
is actually very sick.

595
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:58,864
I felt extreme physical pain,
especially in the back.

596
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:03,335
Yeah, it was really bad.

597
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:05,001
That would be me.

598
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,705
And pretty
much every single thing

599
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,107
that I go through every day.

600
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:15,743
And I'm angry because I hurt so bad.

601
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:18,615
It sucks.

602
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:28,723
And I get anxiety, and I can't breathe.

603
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:32,130
So, every single thing you
said just nailed it up.

604
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:36,838
And it's just kind of nice
to know that somebody knows

605
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,473
that I'm making it up.

606
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:40,140
Mm-hmm.

607
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:41,741
I can see it upsets you
seeing your wife like that.

608
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,109
It does.

609
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,545
You know,
and I really can't do anything to help her.

610
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:49,279
Well, I didn't even realize I was angry

611
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:52,216
until you said it, and I want my life back.

612
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,153
I couldn't believe

613
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:57,523
that people could even get
out of bed in the morning

614
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:00,862
or do anything because it's so severe.

615
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:03,133
I was just overwhelmed.

616
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:07,941
I felt that there were possibly
other people in the house

617
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:10,878
that might be having health issues, too.

618
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,614
Well, Sara... You've been taking her

619
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:14,536
to the doctors for how
long for her stomach?

620
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:15,517
A year and a half.

621
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,755
And they can't find anything wrong.

622
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,462
What else did you get?

623
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:32,497
So, there's one male that's
causing a lot of problems here.

624
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,465
Right off the bat, it was...

625
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,367
You know, he was telling me, you know,

626
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:42,371
that he's extremely religious, that you...

627
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:44,472
the family that's there now...

628
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:48,608
needs to accept Jesus Christ
into your hearts as your savior.

629
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,678
He despises everybody in the house,

630
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,612
and he wants you all out

631
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:55,916
because he believes you
are not clean or pure,

632
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:59,782
and he is taking on the role of a ghost.

633
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:03,955
He was showing himself
becoming massive and dark,

634
00:33:03,957 --> 00:33:05,557
and he was showing me

635
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:09,428
how he would stomp down the hallway

636
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,300
between the rooms and
be in the hall like...

637
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:15,437
The footstep stuff
is something they all hear.

638
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:18,076
Oh, yeah.

639
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:20,446
Yep, on a daily basis.

640
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,053
Now, you see a shadow figure

641
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:26,090
- coming up the porch all the time.
- Yeah.

642
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:28,692
Like somebody's coming up the stairs

643
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:32,297
and then passing the windows
and going to the door,

644
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:33,797
but when I go to answer the door,

645
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,366
- there's nobody there.
- Mm-hmm.

646
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:37,502
You got a real interesting story.

647
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:39,370
It was about 2:30 in the morning.

648
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:42,504
The shadow was on the porch, and I said,

649
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,439
"I'm gonna do something,"

650
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,540
so I grabbed the flashlight,

651
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,241
I opened the door, and this thing took off.

652
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:48,943
- And I gave chase.
- Mm-hmm.

653
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:52,380
And we get to the garage,
and I stopped immediately

654
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:58,288
because whatever it was just
cleared a path for itself.

655
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,258
The bikes were thrown to
the left and to the right.

656
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,394
I didn't know what to do.

657
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:04,595
Now,
does the stuff they're describing

658
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,297
sound like it's him?

659
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,532
I think so because those are all things

660
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:12,673
that I think he believes would bother you.

661
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,976
But the other thing that he would do is

662
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,982
become physical towards people.

663
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:21,486
He touched my head.

664
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:28,464
He also showed me him kind
of trying to smother people.

665
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,135
He likes to get close to certain
people while they're in bed.

666
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,305
He likes to take his fingers

667
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,006
and try to push them down people's throats

668
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:39,173
to make you choke.

669
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:43,945
This man kind of has his sights set

670
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:47,479
on one female in particular
in the household,

671
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,845
and the one thing that I did see
was that she had longer hair.

672
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,720
What he would do is, like,
go to the end of the bed

673
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,387
and, like, become this dark,

674
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,752
you know, this darkness

675
00:34:57,754 --> 00:34:59,754
and would then show me him,

676
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:03,324
like, laying on top of this person.

677
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:06,899
Yeah, that is quite disturbing.

678
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:10,530
The main reason we're here
is for your daughter, Sara.

679
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:11,437
Right.

680
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,108
- And she just kind of described her.
- Yeah.

681
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,578
But she's also been getting scratched.

682
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,912
Okay.

683
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,516
And at one point, it had looked

684
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,488
like somebody had taken her by the wrist

685
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,258
and held her wrist tight,
and she was bruised.

686
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:30,867
I explained the situation to an artist,
and she drew it.

687
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,601
Of what he's doing?

688
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:33,769
Yes.

689
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:39,177
Oh, geez.

690
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:45,083
Wow.

691
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:53,689
Wow.

692
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:56,793
Yeah, that's very disturbing.

693
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,135
You can't even protect her from him.

694
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:04,534
That's the infuriating part.

695
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:07,135
I can't... That's my job.

696
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,671
I can't do it.

697
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:13,976
But it at least explains
some things of why maybe

698
00:36:13,978 --> 00:36:15,812
nobody could find out
what's going on with her.

699
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,280
They're not gonna find it.

700
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,115
It's not anything that
any doctors can find.

701
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:23,155
Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.

702
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,062
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

703
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,966
Well, the first thing is, obviously,

704
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:36,106
he was<i> extremely</i> religious.

705
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,775
I know that at some point he
was living with his mother,

706
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:43,412
also that he was, at some point, detained.

707
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:45,281
When I first met him,

708
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:49,819
he was kind of giving me
the details about his death.

709
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:53,325
And there was extreme head and chest pain,

710
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:56,995
and then everything just stopped for him.

711
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:01,765
He was, I mean, severely injured and hurt.

712
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,833
Well, a lot of who you're describing

713
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:05,134
reminds me of a guy

714
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,169
that actually lived on
your property at one time.

715
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,204
Now, a guy named Martin Southland

716
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:12,442
moved onto your property
with this parents in 1869.

717
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:14,142
You said the guy was detained.

718
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,911
Well, he was institutionalized three times.

719
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:16,979
Oh.

720
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:21,282
1871, 1878, and then again in 1883.

721
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:23,318
And you said the guy was a religious freak,
right?

722
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,086
- Uh, yes.
- Okay.

723
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,556
So, the article I came across for him...

724
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:30,725
According to this, he's "mentally disturbed

725
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,261
by religious excitement."

726
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:36,001
And the other thing you said...
He was a painful death?

727
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,636
Mm-hmm.

728
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,839
He didn't do it on the property,
but he was living in Buffalo.

729
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,875
At the age of 60, he committed suicide,

730
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:42,878
and he cut his throat.

731
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,014
Oh.

732
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:46,051
Makes sense, it does.

733
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,125
Okay, you've got a lot going on.

734
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:55,927
I mean, did you encounter anything else?

735
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,362
Yes, I did.

736
00:37:57,364 --> 00:37:59,231
Geez.

737
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:04,708
The upstairs is a very, very bad area.

738
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,276
Okay.

739
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:08,944
I figured out that there was someone

740
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:11,247
or something there that could jump you.

741
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,416
So, this means that they can
enter your body and take over.

742
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:20,752
So, initially, I was assuming
that it was the religious male,

743
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:25,022
but later,
I figured out that it's actually a female.

744
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,022
She's really good.

745
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:29,690
Like, she can hide.

746
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:33,794
That scares me.

747
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:37,165
I think that she is very dangerous,

748
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:41,369
and I think she has an
extreme effect on the living.

749
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:44,039
One of things that she's doing
to draw out her energy needs

750
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,675
is to actually tap into
the electrical impulses

751
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:51,213
of the human brain and feed off of that,
as well.

752
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:56,487
And this could possibly cause
brain damage in the long term.

753
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:00,793
We feel lost. I don't know what to do.

754
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,794
There's no words that can even describe

755
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:03,829
how I feel about it.

756
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:06,231
Totally helpless.

757
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:24,700
Well, all I can say is

758
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,203
I'm glad you guys called us when you did

759
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:29,208
because, obviously,
you've got a serious problem in your house.

760
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,408
The big question is do you stay and fight,

761
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,776
or do you pack up your bags

762
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:36,611
and take Nathan and Sara, especially,

763
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:38,812
and move the hell out of here?

764
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:41,712
For the answer to that question,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

765
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:46,380
I have some good news and some bad news.

766
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:52,385
Unfortunately,
there's nothing that can really be done

767
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,888
in the case of the elderly woman.

768
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,861
If someone was to approach her

769
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:02,166
and try to tell her that she's deceased,

770
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:05,835
it would make matters worse.

771
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,337
As far as the religious man,

772
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,877
I think the best thing
to do is to reach out

773
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:16,818
to an Evangelical or Pentecostal church.

774
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,587
And you need to find a holy person,

775
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:23,927
and this person needs to deliver
a sermon a perform a blessing.

776
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:27,063
And then, once that's done,
he'll move right on.

777
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,000
So, what do they do about
this woman that jumps people?

778
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:33,233
There needs to be three sensitives.

779
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:37,402
It needs to be two females and one male.

780
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:39,168
One of them has to be a physical medium.

781
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,969
The other two, I want to be different,

782
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:45,810
whatever,
like a psychic knower or a psychic empath.

783
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:48,445
And what they need to do is
actually have séance upstairs.

784
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:54,085
That's how they're going
to basically trap her...

785
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,355
amongst the three of them.

786
00:40:56,357 --> 00:41:00,026
And then,
each one is going to do what they do

787
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:02,396
to move a deceased person on.

788
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:06,234
And then, once that's completed,
she'll be gone.

789
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:09,671
In the meantime,

790
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:15,341
because your daughter is so sensitive,

791
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:18,645
I do think that she
should not be in the house

792
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:19,746
until this is completed.

793
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,545
And things could get a lot more intense.

794
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,550
Now, the question is will
there be a change in Sara

795
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,518
when all this is done?

796
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,754
I mean, she should be fine.

797
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,623
I'm glad to hear that.

798
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,424
And, you know, I don't even have to ask you

799
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,891
if you're gonna take Amy's advice.

800
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,291
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yes.

801
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:39,890
Without question.

802
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:42,234
No, I just really want to
get started with these tasks

803
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,999
that we have that Amy has given us

804
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,668
so that we can help Sara,

805
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,870
help the family, and get our house back.

806
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,241
It's like taking that big sigh

807
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,207
that you've wanted to take forever.

808
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,509
I really hope Sheila
and George follow my advice

809
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:56,843
and deal with the dangerous entities

810
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:58,544
terrorizing their family.

811
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:01,547
With the help of priest and mediums,

812
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,416
they should be able to
free their home of evil

813
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:05,085
and lead a peaceful life.
