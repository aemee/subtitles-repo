1
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:51,125
PEACE AND PROSPERITY

2
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,379
RETURN OUR HOMELAND

3
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:57,673
- Protect His Majesty!
- Yes!

4
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,727
Qianlong,
the brothers of the Red Flower Society...

5
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,061
will take your worthless life tonight!

6
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,317
- Set sail!
- Aye!

7
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,185
Chan Ga-Lok?

8
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:04,783
You dare assassinate the emperor?!

9
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,952
You're obviously a Han Chinese,
yet want to be Emperor of Manchuria.

10
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,871
Tonight, I'll take your worthless life,
for the sake of millions of Han people.

11
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,127
Take care, Your Majesty!

12
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:23,426
Why...
aren't I allowed to sleep well?

13
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,553
- Your slaves deserve death!
- Listen!

14
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,222
Send for the Governor
of Nine Gates, Ordo.

15
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,451
May I ask if this gentleman
is here to buy a sword?

16
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:49,660
No.

17
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:52,872
If you're not here to buy a sword,
then what can I do for you?

18
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:01,380
My master has nightmares every night
and suffers from severe insomnia.

19
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:03,216
If he's sick,
he should see a doctor.

20
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,593
We're just blacksmiths here.

21
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:08,304
It's no use seeing a doctor.

22
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,430
My master said,
"just kill the demon in my dreams".

23
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,813
Only then can he sleep soundly.

24
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,898
Who is your master?

25
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,152
My master is Qianlong.

26
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:27,823
Five days ago, I killed a member of the
Red Flower Society known as Thunderhand.

27
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:29,200
What?!

28
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,536
You killed Fourth Brother Man?

29
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:34,705
I found a letter on his body.

30
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:39,373
I know the Red Flower Society has left
a register in the hands of a swordsmith.

31
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,047
That's right!
I've already sent the register away.

32
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:45,216
Don't expect to get hold of it!

33
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,762
- That so?
- Let's avenge Fourth Brother!

34
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,659
- Let's go.
- Yes!

35
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,647
<i>Tiger Lei's so rich.
What business does he do in Shandong?</i>

36
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,900
<i>He used to be a bandit.</i>

37
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:47,111
I heard that he used his money
to organise this sports meeting.

38
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,530
So what if he has money?
What's so great about being rich?

39
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,782
Those who have dirty money
ride roughshod over the people.

40
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,534
After buying up all the fields,

41
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,869
in just three months the land in
Guangdong became too expensive.

42
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,205
Nothing can be done!

43
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:59,791
The Lord Prefect and Tiger Lei
are in collusion with each other.

44
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,584
How can he not be arrogant?!

45
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,044
(Mandarin)
<i>Miss, let's go.</i>

46
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,839
<i>It seems they all think
really badly of my father.</i>

47
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:09,133
<i>Miss,
you're only realising this now?</i>

48
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:11,719
<i>Does anyone here know us?</i>

49
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:14,096
<i>Don't be afraid...
Let's go quickly, though!</i>

50
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,725
That girl is beautiful.
Let's go have some fun!

51
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,310
- Great...
- Let's go!

52
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,439
<i>Look there,
should we stay and take a look?</i>

53
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,608
<i>Stop looking!
Let's go back quickly!</i>

54
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,527
- Little girl, you out all alone?
- <i>What're you doing?</i>

55
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,822
- Come on...
- <i>Go away!</i>

56
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,406
Let's talk...

57
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,326
- Turns out she's a northern girl!
- She's real pretty!

58
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,786
Don't bully me!
We can speak Cantonese!

59
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:41,874
Ooh! That's even better!
There won't be any misunderstanding!

60
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,586
Hey, don't bother my sister!

61
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,632
- She's your sister?
- I know him!

62
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,176
He's that guy!
How can he have a sister?

63
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:53,552
I know you better!

64
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:56,347
You're the bastard who specialises
in pimping for his boss!

65
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,140
- You talk to us like that?!
- Go on!

66
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,352
Come on!

67
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,230
Fight with our boss?
You want to die?!

68
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:06,399
- Beat him!
- Beat me up?!

69
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:10,486
Fighting here?
Want to go to the Ministry of Justice?

70
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,780
It's nothing to do with him!

71
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:16,075
Hey,
today's my first day on duty.

72
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:17,409
Can you give me face?

73
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,036
Ask him to give you face.

74
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,374
Outrageous!
Fighting here?

75
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,001
Want to go to the Ministry of Justice?

76
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:27,295
Sorry...

77
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:29,881
- No fighting!
- Yeah-yeah...

78
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:31,382
Sorry!

79
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,011
Hey, kid!

80
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,180
We didn't get to finish our fight.

81
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:40,725
If you have the guts,
go and join the competition.

82
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,768
Want to compete with me?

83
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:47,686
Our Master Sing is a gold medal athlete
from St. Joseph's College in Shanghai.

84
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,611
Master Yuk, you don't know how
to play the foreign devils' games.

85
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:52,779
Are you stupid?

86
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,948
How could Master Yuk not know?
He's so good at martial arts.

87
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,992
Hey, Northern girl!
Your "big brother" doesn't dare!

88
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,619
Hey, don't talk nonsense!
He's not my...

89
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:03,247
Then make your move!

90
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,624
One foot eight.

91
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,836
<i>One foot eight:
the exact length of a snake spear.</i>

92
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:10,170
<i>The next one up is awesome.</i>

93
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,049
<i>Three consecutive gold medals from
St. Joseph's College in Shanghai.</i>

94
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,342
<i>Terrific!</i>

95
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,261
- Two feet two, next up.
- <i>A record breaker...</i>

96
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,179
<i>and a reputation well-deserved.</i>

97
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:21,974
<i>Look at this next one,
he's wearing a long jacket!</i>

98
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,934
<i>No information.</i>

99
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:33,653
<i>Let's see how he jumps...</i>

100
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,822
- <i>He stuttered!</i>
- Are your feet weak?

101
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,117
<i>Hey, hurry up and jump!</i>

102
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,286
Walking this slowly,
how long will it take you to cross?

103
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:44,204
- I'll give you a ride!
- <i>Still haven't jumped?</i>

104
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,041
<i>He's jumping!</i>

105
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,961
<i>What force!</i>

106
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:54,798
He jumped over the sandbox!

107
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,302
How stylish!

108
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,597
Although you're just an ant,
I won't bully you.

109
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,559
Kid, the next event is
a four-man relay race.

110
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:06,936
I won't lose to you.

111
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:08,229
Let's go!

112
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:10,773
The relay race needs four.

113
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,858
- How can we three run?
- What do we do?

114
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,953
Young lady, the next race is a relay
that takes four people to run.

115
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,038
There are only three of us,
can you help?

116
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:27,623
- Me?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,625
I'm such a slow runner.

118
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,835
Would you be slower than an ant?

119
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,798
- About the same.
- That's good enough! Come on!

120
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,262
You, first leg.

121
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,848
- What leg do I run?
- You? First leg!

122
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,933
Get ready!

123
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,351
Start!

124
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,939
Hurry up...

125
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,861
Faster...

126
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:15,754
- I can't do it!
- You <i>can</i> do it!

127
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,137
Hey, get up!

128
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:35,149
Run faster!
She's so slow, we're gonna lose--

129
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:50,831
Look at me.

130
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,128
Run faster!

131
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:02,843
- Whoa! The pigtail's standing up!
- Yeah, the pigtail's vertical!

132
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,561
Hurry up...
Faster...

133
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,703
Hurry up!
Faster!

134
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,628
Wow! He's flying over grass!

135
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:45,511
<i>The double event champion-youth with
the long-jacket must participate next year.</i>

136
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:48,764
<i>The three-time consecutive champions
can go back to Shanghai and eat shit!</i>

137
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,355
Miss, thanks for your help.

138
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,857
You have a share in this medal.
I give it to you.

139
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,985
- How about you?
- Pfft! It belongs to Tiger Lei.

140
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,320
I don't want it!

141
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,282
- What's your surname?
- My surname's Chan.

142
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,658
Go to hell!

143
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:10,077
Hey, why are you hitting people...?

144
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,663
How dare you ruin my face?
Teach him a lesson!

145
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:49,074
I like nothing more than fighting.
Bring it on!

146
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,341
Come on!

147
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,727
Well?
Still want to fight?

148
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:21,398
Thank you...
so much for supporting my fight.

149
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,524
Thanks!

150
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,527
What's this fight about?
Who's fighting?

151
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,987
They were fighting.
I've arrested them for you.

152
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,405
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.

153
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:29,656
- Take them all back!
- Go!

154
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:30,950
Take them back!

155
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:33,452
- What is it?
- You're going, too!

156
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,703
- I'm going, too?
- Right!

157
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,663
- I was only helping! Are you serious?
- Get moving...

158
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:38,123
Hey, wait a minute!

159
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,711
- Hey, let's go!
- What's your hurry?

160
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,378
LEI RESIDENCE

161
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:47,257
Fucking hell!
Motherfucker! Fuck!

162
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,886
How dare he refuse to sell the
Central Primary School to me?!

163
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:54,098
Isn't he hitting a louse
on a tiger's head?

164
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,600
Go on!
Tell the Lord Prefect...

165
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,935
to frame him for being a pirate...

166
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,188
and chop off Principal Wong's head!

167
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,481
Yes, Master!

168
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:07,278
Master, the past few days I've heard many
people outside are dissatisfied with us.

169
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:10,406
So what if they're dissatisfied?
Am I afraid of them?

170
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,408
Master,
of course, you're not afraid.

171
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:16,954
However, as the old saying goes:
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

172
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:21,621
If we want to develop in Guangdong,
we must integrate with them, right?

173
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:25,129
- How do we do that?
- Master, I have an idea.

174
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:29,300
If Master wishes to settle down
here and make a name for himself,

175
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,803
why not hold a martial arts contest
here for the young miss' hand?

176
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,723
This is very unfair to
Tingting in my opinion.

177
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,935
- Master, you must act decisively.
- Fuck!

178
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,145
As the old saying goes:
"a woman's heart is with her husband."

179
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:46,400
When a daughter gets married
she won't remember her own parents.

180
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,820
Master, do you think your in-laws
have received any benefits...

181
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:52,280
from you and your wife?

182
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,199
Fucking hell!

183
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:56,451
You said what I was thinking!

184
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,703
That's what I'm going to do!

185
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,204
Brilliant, Master!

186
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:00,498
Brilliant!

187
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,332
Then it's decided.

188
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,667
A martial arts contest for a groom!

189
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,752
JIANGNING YAMEN (COURT)

190
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:07,338
Master Yuk, we're screwed!

191
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:08,756
Our names are held in
the Ministry of Justice.

192
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:09,924
If word gets out, we're screwed!

193
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,801
Right! If my dad finds out,
he'll scold me to death!

194
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,677
Don't worry.
I just scribbled some names.

195
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,762
Your name's Yuen Kwai,
your name's Lau Chun-Wai.

196
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,056
What about you...?

197
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,184
I'm the impressive Wong...

198
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,645
Jing.

199
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:24,354
Hey,
I'm going back to the store.

200
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,315
My mum'll scold me if I don't show.

201
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,900
- That's all for now.
- Master Yuk...

202
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,658
<i>That white girl's hair is rather
interesting, so curly...</i>

203
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,537
<i>Her glasses are even more interesting,
so dark...</i>

204
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,581
<i>I guess in that case,
I can just paint these black.</i>

205
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:50,547
<i>Jeez, I can't see anything!
The aim is to look stylish.</i>

206
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,300
<i>Oh, so she's blind!</i>

207
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,136
Proprietress!

208
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,221
Trying to scare me to death?!

209
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,057
You look very stylish
wearing those glasses.

210
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,310
Your voice is very sexy.

211
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:05,353
Are you here to sell
fabrics or make jokes?

212
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,730
Aren't I taking care of you?

213
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:10,483
The cloth inside is more expensive.
The cloth outside is much cheaper.

214
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,527
- Which would you like to buy?
- I'll buy one from outside.

215
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:14,988
- You want one from the outside?
- Yes.

216
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:16,906
<i>I won't give you credit!</i>

217
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,410
That's right, this one...

218
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,246
- This one?
- Yes, thanks.

219
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,247
How much?

220
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,333
I want to buy...

221
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,585
This much...
Right here, thanks.

222
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,336
- There?
- No, here...

223
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,546
- There?
- Just here...

224
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,424
- There?
- Yeah...

225
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,801
Buying it to wipe your nose?

226
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,431
Robbery?!

227
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:43,350
Hey!

228
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,436
- Hey, this white--
- Your head's white!

229
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,855
- No, Mum! This white--
- Don't be rude!

230
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,982
It really hurts when you hit me!

231
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,484
- Mum, you're so stylish.
- Hurry, go get the scales.

232
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,610
OK!

233
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,446
- Scales?
- My cloth is calculated by the pound.

234
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,324
Why else would you take so much?

235
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:00,075
You can see it?

236
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,245
I guessed, though I couldn't see.
Would a blind person hit you twice?

237
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,330
In that case,
I paid with those two hits!

238
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:07,124
Trying to leave?

239
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,922
Eat this!

240
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,846
Shit!
You killed someone, now we're in trouble!

241
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:23,098
Relax, it's two inches short.
Measure if you don't believe me.

242
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:24,349
Really?

243
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:27,436
Measure carefully.
Mustn't let him bleed.

244
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:31,148
Don't bleed...

245
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,776
Whoa!
Still a long way to go.

246
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:35,735
A full six inches difference!

247
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,237
The white guy has a deep throat!

248
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,366
He deserves bad luck!

249
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,909
I'm in a good mood today,
we're closing.

250
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,536
Mum, yesterday you closed in a bad mood,
today you're closing in a good mood.

251
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,995
Of course,
your father's coming back today.

252
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:48,498
How can I be in the mood
to do anything but close?

253
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:53,003
Mum... I met a girl today
who's very charming...

254
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,171
- and very beautiful.
- Really?

255
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:55,547
Then take tomorrow off.

256
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,966
Close the store again?!

257
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,346
Master Yuk!
Hey, Master Yuk!

258
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,557
- It's bad...
- What's the matter?

259
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:08,643
The Lord Prefect's here and he's
talking to the master in the hall.

260
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:09,978
Shit!

261
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,730
What do you know about it?

262
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,606
I got into a fight today.

263
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,109
Don't worry,
Mum'll stand up for you.

264
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:19,696
Lord Prefect, fellow citizens...

265
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,739
I must give you an explanation.

266
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,743
Brother Fong,
you truly are a man of principle.

267
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,496
I truly am ashamed.

268
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:33,126
- When the two of them return, I will--
- So many people here?

269
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:36,421
Oh, Lord Prefect, fellow citizens...

270
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,214
Give face to this little woman.

271
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,217
Whatever's happened,
I, Miu Chui-Fa will take care of it.

272
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,927
Of course, it's your responsibility!

273
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,972
You... beat the white guy
to look like a pig's head!

274
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,807
- Huh?
- Furthermore...

275
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:50,811
That cloth you sold me, turns out
it'd been used for wiping the floor!

276
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,479
She thinks my wife looks like a radish!

277
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,522
No matter what,
she refuses to sell cloth to my wife.

278
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,900
Not only that, the other day
she laughed at me for being stupid.

279
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,985
- This is outrageous!
- Speak!

280
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,863
What else do you have to say?

281
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,781
If I'd known about this,
I wouldn't have come home!

282
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,950
"Mushroom", serve the punishment!

283
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:06,493
Beat me again?

284
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,376
Master, give me face.

285
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:16,628
Give <i>you</i> face?

286
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:19,422
You beat the young mistress,
no need to give me face.

287
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:29,265
Dad, don't hit Mum!

288
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,975
If you want, hit me!

289
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:35,397
See how your son respects you.

290
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:37,482
May I ask,
is this the Fong household?

291
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,361
- This is the Fong household?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,823
Hmph! Turns out your name's Fong Sai-Yuk,
not Wong Jing!

293
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,074
Why do you call him Wong Jing?

294
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,408
This morning he got into a fight.

295
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,662
When I took him to the Ministry of
Justice, he said his name was Wong Jing.

296
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:52,622
You bastard!

297
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:58,920
- Does it hurt?
- Ow, that hurts!

298
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:02,508
I withstood most of it for you,
it hurts me more.

299
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:05,135
Mum,
Dad doesn't know martial arts.

300
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,137
Why can't you avoid him each time?

301
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:09,723
Of course, I have to give him face
in front of others, silly boy!

302
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,684
A man's status within
the family is very noble.

303
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,979
Whoa!
Very noble, indeed!

304
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:17,689
Not going to bed yet?

305
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:29,576
I don't know how you teach your son.

306
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,788
Even though he's older,
you still protect him.

307
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,874
He's a grown-up now and
needs to be independent.

308
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:43,131
You're often at work all
day and don't come home.

309
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,508
If my son doesn't keep me company,
who will?

310
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:49,138
And when you do come home,
you listen to the villagers' nonsense...

311
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,141
and beat me like this.

312
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:55,310
You don't think of me as your wife,
at all!

313
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,688
Listen to me.

314
00:20:58,856 --> 00:20:59,982
I won't listen.

315
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:01,358
Listen to me.

316
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,443
I won't listen...

317
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,867
"The beauty rolls up the beaded curtain."

318
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:11,618
<i>He's reciting poetry again.</i>

319
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:14,370
"She sits,
her eyebrows knitted deep."

320
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:18,751
"But visible are traces of tears."

321
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,045
"Not knowing who her heart hates."

322
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:43,650
I can't resist him, I really can't.
He's so stylish.

323
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:47,445
Why do I get excited for no reason
every time he recites poetry?

324
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,656
Giddy, dizzy, dead...

325
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,909
Was I right about you?

326
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,578
Right.

327
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,829
Then why don't you go to sleep?

328
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:15,724
"PUNCH THE GUANGDONG PROVINCE"

329
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,227
"KICK THE SUZHOU AND HANGZHOU STATES"

330
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:21,688
They're clearly treading on us
Cantonese by hanging these out!

331
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:26,234
Master,
how well written are these couplets?

332
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:29,821
As soon as they were suspended, you
could see how it stoked the fire in them.

333
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:34,701
Tingting...

334
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,537
Dad, I don't want to be the
bride in a martial arts contest!

335
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,330
You're not fit to talk to me!

336
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:41,082
If you keep pushing me,
I'll just leave!

337
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,210
If you keep talking,
I'll beat you to death!

338
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,296
- Fucking hell!
- My Lord!

339
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:49,549
You're pushing Tingting too hard.
Don't I get a say in the matter?

340
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:52,051
When I'm talking,
why don't you shut up?

341
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:54,387
I'm doing all this to win people's hearts.

342
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,974
If I don't,
how will I be able to stand here?

343
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,725
- Don't you get it?
- Understand! I do understand!

344
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,396
- Get one over on that bastard!
- What are you laughing at?

345
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:04,147
I'm not putting a show for you!

346
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:05,648
Fucking hell!

347
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,783
Hey, Mum!
You sure you can stand this?

348
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,159
Yes, I'm sure!

349
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,702
- You really can stand it!
- I can!

350
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,413
- So are you ready?
- I am.

351
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,957
Hey, are you sure
you're doing it right?

352
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:25,418
Is this how white people curl their hair?
It's more like a barbecue!

353
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:27,629
Yes, all white people
curl their hair like this.

354
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:29,380
Hey,
curl my eyelashes later, too.

355
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:31,508
Sure,
I can curl your armpit hair, as well!

356
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,551
How disgusting, you naughty boy!

357
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,262
If your father could see me now...

358
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:38,557
I wonder if he'd recite poetry to me?

359
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:41,309
Of course,
he'd even recite English poetry.

360
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,064
English poetry?
I'd get even more excited hearing that!

361
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:49,275
- Son, how do you recite English poetry?
- I know.

362
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:52,028
"Wonderful!"
It's wonderful to recite.

363
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,905
- How come you know foreign speak?
- Siu Fong-Fong taught me--

364
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:55,073
<i>Sai-Yuk!</i>

365
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,116
Hey, your father's here!
Hurry up!

366
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,702
Quickly now!
Hurry and it'll be fine.

367
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,330
- Hubby!
- <i>What're you doing in there?</i>

368
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:04,415
Hubby, you mustn't come in.
I'll be pretty in a bit!

369
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,544
- Faster now...
- Mum, don't move until it's finished.

370
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:09,629
- <i>Sai-Yuk?</i>
- Hubby, you mustn't come in yet!

371
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:11,923
I'll be pretty real soon!

372
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:13,800
Oh, bugger...

373
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,803
- What's the matter?
- It's on fire...

374
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:24,977
Why do you look like that?

375
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:26,479
I can't recite poetry in this mess.

376
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:27,689
I'm off to study.

377
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,942
I'm going into the city.
Want me to buy anything for you?

378
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,908
I was pretty a moment ago!

379
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,746
Dear fellow countrymen...

380
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:45,206
I, Tiger Lei,
have just arrived in your noble realm.

381
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:48,627
It's important that
we all live in harmony.

382
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:51,254
I arranged this martial arts
contest to find a groom.

383
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:53,631
Whoever grabs the
embroidered ball will win.

384
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,134
During the contest,
only one foot can touch the ground.

385
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,720
If both feet touch the ground,
you lose.

386
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:02,682
Whoever can defeat my wife,
Li Xiaohuan...

387
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:06,269
can marry my daughter,
Lei Tingting.

388
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:09,981
If anyone during the contest
is injured or killed by my wife,

389
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:12,692
I, Tiger Lei,
will not be held responsible.

390
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,279
Let me now introduce my wife,
Li Xiaohuan.

391
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:29,750
Whoa, she's stunningly beautiful!

392
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:32,921
If she marries me, I'll make sure
she doesn't get a good night's sleep!

393
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:35,298
- You sure you're capable?
- If not, I'll ask for your help!

394
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:36,674
Great...
Let's sign up first!

395
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:38,051
Go sign up!

396
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:41,888
Those three are of the same mind.

397
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:43,514
Hey, "Bronze Hammer Six"!
Go tell Master Yuk!

398
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:47,018
- OK...
- Excuse me, please...

399
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:51,398
- Where's Sai-Yuk?
- Hitting the books inside.

400
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:54,109
- I'm going to the dye mill.
- Come back soon.

401
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:58,029
"Comes in the night - one, two, three;
fallen flowers - four, five, six."

402
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,198
"One, two, three, four, five..."

403
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:02,325
Six!
Whoa! So many?

404
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:03,618
Who is it?

405
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,205
Master Yuk, it's just us!
Come outside...

406
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:08,456
Sai-Yuk.

407
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,920
"Spring sleeps, unaware of dawn."

408
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:17,715
"Everywhere,
the birds are heard singing."

409
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:21,178
"The sound of wind and rain
comes in the night."

410
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,137
"How many fallen flowers..."

411
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,224
- Dad, you're here?!
- Sai-Yuk, sit down.

412
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:28,809
Dad's going to the city now.

413
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:31,854
How long will you be gone?
I'll really miss you.

414
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:34,023
Try your best to study well.

415
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,108
OK!

416
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:40,112
Today's not for studying!

417
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,660
Hey!
What do you want?

418
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,411
Tiger Lei's holding a martial arts
contest to find a groom.

419
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,621
His daughter's very pretty.

420
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:50,165
- Really?
- Yeah, he actually said...

421
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:52,334
"Punch the Guangdong province,
kick the Suzhou and Hangzhou states."

422
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,836
Ridiculous!
What a big mouth!

423
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,046
Hey,
what do you think about this?

424
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,673
What do I think?

425
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:01,259
I should keep studying!

426
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:02,552
Are you kidding me?!

427
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:06,013
My dad's inside.
If he found out, he'd beat me to death!

428
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,891
Hey, Master Yuk,
what are you doing up there?

429
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,935
Master Yuk, are you really going to
let an outsider tread on us like that?

430
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,896
Master Yuk,
you'll only be out for a bit.

431
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,189
Two or three gestures will knock him down!

432
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:16,274
Master Yuk, that's no good!
The Master's here!

433
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,483
OK!

434
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:19,361
Mushroom!

435
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:21,488
- Stand in for me for a while.
- I can't!

436
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:22,989
I won't be long!

437
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:27,202
Hey...
I have to go to the city with Master!

438
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:39,297
GUANGZHOU: FRIENDSHIP GAMES

439
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,056
- Master, this time it's bad!
- What is it?

440
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:50,350
The young miss faked a
toilet break and escaped.

441
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,769
She's gone?!

442
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:57,774
Fucking hell!
Fuck!

443
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,782
- Come on...
- No! It's no good, Master!

444
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,784
Don't...
I'm not married!

445
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,786
- It's no good!
- What're you looking at?!

446
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:12,914
How can this be right?

447
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,707
There's no problem, My Lord!

448
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:25,760
Fok, aren't you a Master (monk)?

449
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,219
You're competing in a groom contest?

450
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:29,847
Yeah, my secular heart is astir!

451
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:32,642
If your secular heart is astir,
you must protect your six indriyas!

452
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:36,896
Dear fellow countrymen...

453
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:40,650
I had hoped to find a real
hero among you Cantonese,

454
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:43,862
but I fear it's too difficult.

455
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,030
You're ignorant!

456
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:46,489
<i>Hooray...</i>

457
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:49,408
- Who the hell is that?
- You don't recognise me?

458
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,203
One of the Top Ten Outstanding
Youths in Guangdong...

459
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,832
the Invincible Spiritual Boxer,
Fong Sai-Yuk, that's me!

460
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,002
You're just a damn punk kid
who thinks he's stylish.

461
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:00,628
But is your kung fu good enough?

462
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:03,130
Test it against my wife
and then we'll know!

463
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,259
Alright!

464
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:10,931
Xiaohuan, test him!

465
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:18,730
- Is it you?
- Not me, it's my daughter!

466
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:21,358
- Let me check the goods first!
- You must get past me first!

467
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:57,852
Let me borrow your head!

468
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:08,279
My God!
You tricked me?!

469
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,419
My feet haven't touched the ground!

470
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:28,591
Don't worry,
I want to play until you drop!

471
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:37,100
Still waiting for you to try
our Cantonese head pillars.

472
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:41,396
Ouch, my head!

473
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:42,855
It hurts!
My neck!

474
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,694
When a woman steps on you,
you get three years bad luck!

475
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:51,990
Terrific...
Master Yuk, beat her...

476
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:54,909
- Hey, how many of you can stand it?
- We can stand it!

477
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:57,661
But I <i>can't</i> stand it!
Strike her down!

478
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,747
Shandong Mama,
better stabilise your horse stance!

479
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:23,771
Ow, you're standing on my neck!

480
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:30,445
My head is spinning!

481
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,700
Darling, be careful!

482
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,326
Oh, I will!

483
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,913
Let me borrow your pigtail!

484
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:44,875
Ouch, let go of my pigtail!
Let it go!

485
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:02,935
Master Yuk, throw her down!

486
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:04,521
I'm giving the crowd what they want!

487
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,607
Quick, catch my wife!

488
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,028
They found some helpers!

489
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,241
- Well?
- Don't worry! I can beat them, too!

490
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:26,959
Be careful, everyone...
Hold tight!

491
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:42,058
I'll scatter your head pillars!

492
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,271
Six, hold up Master Yuk!

493
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:56,364
Master Yuk,
you have our moral support...

494
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,409
See, you Cantonese fall
apart when you're beaten!

495
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,578
You fall apart...

496
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:04,664
- Hey, can you stand it?
- I can stand it!

497
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:06,582
- We can stand it!
- No worries!

498
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:10,086
Well?
You only have those two to hold you up?

499
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,214
If not for the six pillars supporting you,
how could you sustain this long?

500
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,507
Fight!

501
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:16,676
If you win,
you'll be my son-in-law.

502
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:26,352
Beat her...

503
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,565
Hey, your support reinforcements
are going limp with exhaustion.

504
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:32,859
Let's fight!

505
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,992
My God, trying to pull my pigtail?!
I'll jab you in the eye!

506
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,785
You asked for it!
I'll kick your shin's weak spot!

507
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,954
- I'll poke your belly button!
- I'll blow up your balls!

508
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:47,414
- My eye is hurt!
- Six, are you OK?

509
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,750
- I'm fine...
- Come on, Cantonese!

510
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:52,128
- Six!
- Beat them...

511
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,633
I'll bite your ear off!

512
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:03,222
Hey... hold on!

513
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,724
Six is getting beaten!

514
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:07,727
Wait for me!

515
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:18,070
Grab your pillar!

516
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,531
I just can't stand it!

517
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,249
Master Yuk, don't disappoint me!

518
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,334
When have I, Fong Sai-Yuk
ever disappointed you?

519
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,714
Hammer head!

520
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:43,929
Propel me up!

521
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:53,022
Madam!

522
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:54,648
Don't fall down!

523
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:57,193
Fortunately,
you grabbed hold and kicked me!

524
00:34:58,403 --> 00:34:59,946
I lost...

525
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,406
Master Yuk,
I'm so disappointed in you!

526
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,783
If you weren't disappointed,
I'd be in despair!

527
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,493
What led you to lose?

528
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,580
You're too good!
I'm not capable of beating you.

529
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:11,415
Miss, I'm sorry!
I can't marry you.

530
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,752
Kid, can we discuss it...?

531
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,128
Fucking hell!

532
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:19,131
Guangdong's Top Ten Outstanding Youths
spilling blood on the martial arts stage.

533
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,341
Anyone placing a bet?

534
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:21,800
Another loss.

535
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:24,595
There are ten outstanding
youths in Guangdong?!

536
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,221
Is it that serious?

537
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:27,932
No one would listen to
me unless I exaggerate!

538
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,225
Bet one more dollar for me.

539
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,976
Bet until someone wins.

540
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:33,229
Then you must look for my son,
Fong Sai-Yuk to show up.

541
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,981
He already did show up,
and got knocked down by someone!

542
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:38,401
And he calls himself one of
Guangdong's Top Ten Outstanding Youths?!

543
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:40,778
Seems now, the Fong family will
find it difficult to show up anywhere!

544
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:44,032
That brat's a real disappointment!

545
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:47,827
Dear heroes...

546
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:51,789
Is there anyone else coming up to compete?

547
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,709
If not, that's it for today.

548
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,755
Wait a minute!

549
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:02,633
There's money to pick up!

550
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,468
Go pick up the money!

551
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:07,096
Let me borrow your backs!

552
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,184
I'm here now.

553
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:14,103
Terrific...

554
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,730
May I ask the name of this hero?

555
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,858
And what should I call you,
pretty lady?

556
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,651
Are you bashful?

557
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:26,658
I'm Madam Lei,
the mother of Lei Tingting.

558
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:29,576
If you can defeat me today,
I'll be your mother-in-law.

559
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:31,287
Marry the mother-in-law, too!

560
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:32,538
Big mouth!

561
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:39,253
Did you hear that, huh?
Are you interested, huh?

562
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,380
Don't retreat any further,
or you'll fall down.

563
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:44,300
Who the hell are you?
Are you here to cause trouble?

564
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,759
Mothersucker!

565
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:51,431
Watch my mouth, its...
Mo-ther-fuck-er!

566
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,934
I'm the mysterious Invincible Boxer
of China, whereabouts unknown...

567
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:55,686
Fong Sai-Yuk's elder brother...

568
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,147
Fong Dai-Yuk!

569
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:02,359
Fucking hell!
You brothers have such long nicknames.

570
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:05,780
You use them to intimidate people,
but is your kung fu real or not?

571
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,157
Why don't you ask Madam
to test if it's real?

572
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,785
What's the big deal about
picking up a bouquet of flowers?

573
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:12,161
I'll take it!

574
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,711
Good leg skills, Madam.

575
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:22,671
No better than yours.

576
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:35,100
Why are you holding my big foot?

577
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:55,120
Your face is very smooth.

578
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,457
Madam, why are you so nervous?

579
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,836
Thanks a lot!

580
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:06,381
You weigh quite a bit!
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

581
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:09,260
Now, if you use a little force,
I'll pull you up.

582
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:10,553
Come up!

583
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:12,263
Bouquet!

584
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,097
Be careful!

585
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:17,435
Sneak attack on me?
Too heavy!

586
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,437
Madam!

587
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,907
Madam, we've come down now.

588
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:35,244
Are you alright?

589
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:37,288
I'm OK.

590
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:38,789
I'm <i>not</i> OK!

591
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,959
She's my wife, do you know that?

592
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:44,003
Please remember, everyone.

593
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,380
The Fong family is the
real deal in Guangdong.

594
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,674
What about my Lei family?

595
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,177
Don't touch my body!

596
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:53,845
We're all one family now, right?

597
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:55,431
I only came to compete.

598
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:57,057
Find another for your daughter.

599
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,561
You won't marry my daughter?

600
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,062
I don't want to!

601
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,650
Damn it, Kid!
Say that one more time!

602
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:09,278
Watch my mouth...
Don't-want-to!

603
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,661
Since you won the fight,
you must marry my daughter!

604
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,372
If you don't,
I'll ask the prefect to seize your home!

605
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:22,750
- Go to hell!
- Hell? Who's going to hell?

606
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,293
Don't touch my face!

607
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:26,879
Touching my face will leave a--

608
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:36,597
Give me your finger print.

609
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,726
Then you can't deny your
debt even if you want to!

610
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,437
Stamp it for me!

611
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:56,575
- Who's grabbing my stick?
- Your mum!

612
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:02,748
- Wow, Mum! You're so stylish!
- I did this for you!

613
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,334
I had to pretend to be your big
brother to redeem your reputation.

614
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,002
Go get me the chest.

615
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:08,837
What do you need the chest for?

616
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:11,256
I defeated Tiger Lei's wife,
so he wants me to marry his daughter!

617
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:13,050
Now I have to pack and run!

618
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:15,136
Whoa, Mum!
You're so powerful!

619
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:17,722
- You gay?
- What?

620
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,557
- Shit, the onslaught is coming!
- So what now?

621
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:22,101
- Give them a fight!
- OK!

622
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,229
Hang, sweep, split...

623
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:33,738
Fong Dai-Yuk, here I come!

624
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:39,702
Fong Dai-Yuk...

625
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,206
Fong Dai-Yuk!

626
00:40:44,665 --> 00:40:46,667
- Search inside!
- Yes...

627
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,795
Go inside, search in there!

628
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:53,924
I told you to look for them,
not take a peek!

629
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:55,133
- Find them now!
- Yeah...

630
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:56,385
Hurry up!

631
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,095
Fucking hell!

632
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,139
Fong Dai-Yuk!

633
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:07,020
Why're you crying?

634
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:12,150
- Where's Fong Dai-Yuk?
- My eldest boy's dead!

635
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:14,611
Dead?
How can he be dead?

636
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:17,072
The poor bastard died in the street!

637
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,576
Died in the street?
So, where's his corpse?

638
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,370
Cremated into a pile of ash!

639
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:25,121
Even turned to ash,
I could recognise him.

640
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,748
Let me see.

641
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,834
Really?
You're interested in the ashes?

642
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,836
Mum... here...

643
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:33,672
OK, then!
Look at the ashes...

644
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:37,884
Mum, let's go!
Hurry!

645
00:41:38,678 --> 00:41:39,804
Don't go!

646
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,807
- You're a man!
- No shit!

647
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,143
Aren't you a man?

648
00:41:47,728 --> 00:41:49,730
Come any closer and I'll kill him!

649
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:51,982
Son, what can you do
to him holding a banana?

650
00:41:52,149 --> 00:41:53,275
- Really?!
- It's not a knife?

651
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:54,568
Eat the banana!

652
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:00,198
Catch him...

653
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:08,623
Come down!

654
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:13,796
Mum!

655
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,881
Go quickly!
Forget me, go quickly!

656
00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:18,092
Won't I be struck by
lightning if I forget you?

657
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,385
I'm coming!

658
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,347
How accurate!

659
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:27,435
I can't find your elder son, so I'll
take your younger son in his place.

660
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:30,020
Master, we found Young Miss.

661
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:34,024
It's God's will...

662
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,233
Buddy, hey, buddy!

663
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,486
Wait for his father to return
from the city for the wedding.

664
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:41,240
Fine! I'll postpone the wedding,
but now the bridal chamber!

665
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,657
Let's go!

666
00:42:45,077 --> 00:42:47,079
Go away...
Don't get in the way.

667
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:48,205
Go away now!

668
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:50,832
Are you kidding us?
Let him go now!

669
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,711
Listen, you lot!
Disappear at once!

670
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:56,338
If you lot keep making a noise,
I'll arrest you!

671
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:58,673
Let him go!

672
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:01,427
- My Lord.
- Master Lei.

673
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:03,804
- What's happening outside?
- There's a groundswell out there.

674
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:04,930
I received word...

675
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:07,682
in two days the Commander of the
Nine Gates is coming to Guangdong.

676
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,476
My Lord, do you have any ideas?

677
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:10,852
That's easy!

678
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,230
Ask your son-in-law to get
married in front of the crowd.

679
00:43:13,397 --> 00:43:16,066
He can tell them it's voluntary.

680
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:20,320
That way, everything will be fine when
the Commander of the Nine Gates arrives.

681
00:43:20,488 --> 00:43:23,657
Good!
I'll beat him until he volunteers!

682
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:27,536
Absolutely not!
We must convince people by virtue.

683
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:29,830
Then nothing bad will happen.

684
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:34,084
Right...
Convince people by virtue...

685
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,840
<i>I'm one of the Top Ten
Outstanding Youths in Guangdong.</i>

686
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:43,093
<i>No reason to lose your virginity to her!</i>

687
00:43:44,428 --> 00:43:47,305
<i>If he touches me,
I'll stab him to death!</i>

688
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:49,850
<i>Look at her stupid face,
making out she's demure.</i>

689
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:51,727
<i>I'd rather kick her to the wall!</i>

690
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:55,856
<i>Hmm...
I'll play a scary prank on her!</i>

691
00:43:58,484 --> 00:43:59,818
<i>He can no longer resist!</i>

692
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,529
<i>I'll scare you to death!</i>

693
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:05,950
<i>Just try it!
Try and come near!</i>

694
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,621
Whoa, are you kidding me?!
I threw a cockroach, you threw a knife?!

695
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:13,040
That's going too far!

696
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:18,754
- What do you want?
- Let me tell you...

697
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:21,924
You can have me, but not my heart.
I have a sweetheart.

698
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:23,801
I have one, too!
I won't marry you.

699
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:25,177
I won't marry you either!

700
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:27,971
Alright, swear it!
What'll happen if you marry me?

701
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:29,890
My whole family will die.

702
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:33,435
- What's this?
- Give it back to me!

703
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:36,104
It's neither gold nor silver,
just some crappy iron you hold on to.

704
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,022
Are you daft?

705
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:41,735
Listen to me,
sleep by yourself tonight!

706
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,216
Don't try to persuade me,
I won't go back.

707
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:08,137
I'm not asking you to go back.

708
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,305
Then what are you doing?

709
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:13,641
Actually,
our situations are the same.

710
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:17,604
I was 12 years old when Master Lei
took me to be his servant.

711
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:19,981
At age 16, I became his concubine.

712
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:22,234
I'm just the same as you...

713
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:24,445
Getting married without falling in love.

714
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:27,530
What's the same?
You were happy enough to volunteer.

715
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:29,449
I'm being forced!

716
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:34,621
For the past 20 years,
I thought I was happy.

717
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:39,288
I married a rich husband,
gave birth to a wonderful daughter.

718
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:44,381
But since I saw your elder
brother on that stage...

719
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:48,052
I realised I was cheating myself.

720
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,473
Actually, what I need...

721
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:55,266
What do you need?

722
00:45:57,853 --> 00:45:59,187
Love.

723
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,690
You can't be serious?!
You like my big brother?

724
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:04,818
Actually, I know that your
big brother faked his death.

725
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:09,527
If you see him, could I trouble
you to deliver this letter to him.

726
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,785
Hey,
aren't you afraid of Tiger Lei?

727
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,629
For love,
I'll die without regret.

728
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:31,553
Madam Fong, I really admire you!

729
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,305
Never expected you could woo a woman!

730
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:39,228
Actually, my big brother is...

731
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:45,859
I know you're much better
than your big brother.

732
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,861
It's you?!

733
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:50,447
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything!

734
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:54,367
I just want you to know that, I,
Tiger Lei, convince people by virtue.

735
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:57,746
I don't want you to think I'm
forcing you to be my son-in-law.

736
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:01,750
We should be honest with each
other and bring out our strengths.

737
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:05,754
Perhaps we have many common interests?

738
00:47:05,963 --> 00:47:07,005
Us have common interests?

739
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,548
- Right!
- Really?

740
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,510
- I'm not angry.
- Really?

741
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,930
Convince people by virtue...

742
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,561
Convince people by virtue.

743
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:26,608
Fucking hell!
Who's making that racket?!

744
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:32,364
Convince people by virtue.
I must convince people by virtue.

745
00:47:33,157 --> 00:47:35,951
<i>When the sky is bright,
I practise singing!</i>

746
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:37,661
<i>Beat the gong!</i>

747
00:47:37,828 --> 00:47:40,539
<i>Singing a good folk song
to sell off my wife!</i>

748
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,207
<i>That's great!</i>

749
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:44,793
<i>Where's your mum...?</i>

750
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,130
<i>It's your mum's fault
for giving birth to you!</i>

751
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:55,720
<i>Beat the gong,
be strong and healthy!</i>

752
00:47:55,888 --> 00:47:59,433
<i>You're ready to tear this family apart!</i>

753
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:07,482
<i>Your mother isn't my mum!</i>

754
00:48:07,649 --> 00:48:09,150
<i>Beat the gong!</i>

755
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:12,112
<i>Singing a folk song sells off your wife!</i>

756
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:13,780
<i>That's great!</i>

757
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:18,447
<i>Your mum would've been better
giving birth to a barbecued pork!</i>

758
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,960
<i>When you beat the gong,
you'll be strong and healthy!</i>

759
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:31,256
<i>I'm ready to tear this family apart!</i>

760
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,815
Your mother isn't my mum!

761
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,028
My mother isn't my mum!

762
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,159
- You've gained weight.
- Really?

763
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,286
I can't help it.
Good food, comfy life.

764
00:49:01,745 --> 00:49:03,538
Have you lost your virginity?

765
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:06,833
No!

766
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,501
That's good, then.

767
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,421
Why didn't you run away?

768
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:14,883
I didn't know what your
circumstances were, OK?

769
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:18,345
If by some chance I did run,
what good is it implicating you?

770
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:20,096
Besides,
there are so many people here.

771
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:22,849
They follow me wherever I go.

772
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,394
A truly filial boy.

773
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:27,646
I've had a thorough look at the place.

774
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:29,773
I'll come to save you tonight!

775
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,026
After that, we take a torch
and burn down our ancestral home.

776
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,403
The two of us will be "burnt to death",
you get it?

777
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:37,406
Then we'll go to the city
and find your father.

778
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:39,032
It cheats them of a generation.

779
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:40,533
We'll never come back again!

780
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:42,661
It's all very hush-hush!

781
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,086
- What's wrong?
- Mum, you're so cunning!

782
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:55,048
Oh, yeah!
Someone asked me to give you this letter.

783
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:57,383
- Who?
- Your girlfriend!

784
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,261
MR. FONG DAI-YUK

785
00:50:04,224 --> 00:50:08,269
Xiaohuan, tonight, I'm meeting an
important guest with the Lord Prefect.

786
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:10,647
I may be back late,
you go to bed first.

787
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:31,877
Mum, I'm being chased by dogs!

788
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:34,087
Why are you scared of dogs,
stupid boy?!

789
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,800
Whoa!
Did you offend the bitch?

790
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:42,595
Don't chase me!

791
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:45,015
My God! It's truly terrible
being chased by dogs like this!

792
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:46,099
Run faster, Mum!

793
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:47,809
Did you have to piss off the dogs?

794
00:50:47,976 --> 00:50:49,519
You really are a stupid boy!

795
00:50:49,686 --> 00:50:50,770
This way!

796
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:04,326
Who are you?
You dare break into Lei Mansion?!

797
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,702
Bite him!

798
00:51:06,537 --> 00:51:07,788
Madam!

799
00:51:07,955 --> 00:51:09,206
Don't bite him!

800
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:12,375
Dai-Yuk, it's really you?!

801
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,335
That's right, it's me!

802
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,254
Please ask your monkey gang to leave.

803
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,172
We don't want them eavesdropping on us.

804
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:20,509
Oh, alright...

805
00:51:20,842 --> 00:51:22,844
One, Two, Three, Four
- back inside.

806
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:25,889
Hurry up...

807
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:28,683
- Dai-Yuk!
- Don't come any closer!

808
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:31,561
I'm afraid I cannot bear
the burden of your feelings.

809
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:37,025
Since I received your letter that day,

810
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:41,571
I've been suffering the pain
of yearning every night.

811
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:46,326
I really can't bear it.

812
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:49,538
I had to come see you tonight.

813
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:52,498
"The beauty rolls up the beaded curtain."

814
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:56,294
"She sits,
her eyebrows knitted deep."

815
00:51:56,503 --> 00:51:59,756
"But visible are traces of tears."

816
00:51:59,923 --> 00:52:04,052
"Not knowing who her heart hates."

817
00:52:04,886 --> 00:52:09,386
Madam, this poem was
written especially for you.

818
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,812
He knows how to write poetry.
How stylish!

819
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:15,647
<i>Hey, there are voices over there!</i>

820
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:17,607
Madam, I must take my leave.

821
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:20,234
We will meet again some day.
If you please...

822
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:25,740
Dai-Yuk...

823
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:27,450
Madam, are you alright...?

824
00:52:27,618 --> 00:52:30,162
I'm fine!
What are you doing here?

825
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:32,247
Who asked you to come?

826
00:52:34,249 --> 00:52:35,875
Only fools walk slowly!

827
00:52:53,226 --> 00:52:55,436
It's you?
It's me!

828
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:56,813
You?

829
00:52:59,191 --> 00:53:00,275
It's you!

830
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:03,362
Miss Chen, has Tiger Lei captured
you to be his servant again?

831
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:05,614
Yeah, and you?

832
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:07,407
Me, too!

833
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,662
I went back to the sports field to find you.

834
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:15,456
That day I waited patiently
for you at the sports field.

835
00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:18,460
I didn't see you, so I left!

836
00:53:19,836 --> 00:53:22,880
Waited for me?
You really waited for me?

837
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:27,093
She waited for me!

838
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:31,181
Do you still want this medal?

839
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:33,016
You kept it all this time?

840
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:36,602
<i>There are voices over there!</i>

841
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,854
- <i>Did you find anyone?</i>
- <i>No!</i>

842
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:39,939
I'm afraid they'll discover us!
I'm going now.

843
00:53:43,068 --> 00:53:44,819
Hey, be careful!
There are many dogs that way!

844
00:53:48,323 --> 00:53:50,325
Will I see Miss Chen again if I leave?

845
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:54,120
Hey, Fong Sai-Yuk is here!
Hurry up and catch him!

846
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:56,581
Hey, Fong Sai-Yuk is here!

847
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,500
I came to Guangdong this time,

848
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:01,628
to eliminate the treacherous
rebels of the Red Flower Society.

849
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:05,465
I received word,
I know they'll show up here.

850
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:10,591
Therefore, I hope...
you'll notify me as soon as you have news.

851
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:13,598
Yes, My Lord!

852
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:17,185
My Lord needn't worry.
Your humble servant will try his best.

853
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:19,979
My heart has already been
given to the Imperial Court.

854
00:54:21,106 --> 00:54:25,606
My Lord, here's a small gift.
Please, My Lord, accept it.

855
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:31,324
My son's father-in-law,
there's been an injustice!

856
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:34,077
There's been an injustice?

857
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:36,204
My husband returned yesterday
from a visit to the city.

858
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:38,081
When he didn't see his son,
he took his anger out on me.

859
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:42,085
Look! He hit me till my forehead split,
and used charcoal to burn my hands!

860
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:44,170
You see how miserable I am?!

861
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:45,963
How's that my fucking business?

862
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:50,631
I fucking beg you, my son's father-in-law...
let Sai-Yuk go home and see him for one day.

863
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:53,096
That's all, one day!
Just one... day!

864
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,930
If Brother Fong really is missing his son,
he can come here to see him.

865
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,979
Or, move in here with me.

866
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,022
That way he can see him every day!

867
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,567
Huh?
Are you so unreasonable?

868
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:07,778
Fine! I'll slam myself into a wall,
then you'll get it!

869
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:09,528
You can watch me die!
Got a wall with a hard edge?

870
00:55:09,696 --> 00:55:12,115
Hurry up and tell me!
Got a wall with a hard edge...?

871
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:15,910
- I'll slam myself into a wall...
- Co-Mother-in-Law, don't do that...

872
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:20,123
Master, just let Sai-Yuk
go back with her for one day.

873
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:23,668
I don't really believe she'll
slam herself into a wall and die.

874
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,461
Let her try it!

875
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:28,423
Just look at her,
would she really slam into a wall?!

876
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:30,216
Fine, you can watch me die!

877
00:55:30,383 --> 00:55:31,342
- Dai-Yuk!
- Dai-Yuk?

878
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,262
- Dai-Yuk, Mum's about to die!
- Don't! Master...

879
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:37,306
- Dai-Yuk, Mum's slamming into a wall!
- You want to convince people by virtue?!

880
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,976
Huh? Convince people by virtue?
That's right...

881
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:42,228
Take him home today,
bring him back tomorrow.

882
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:43,604
Thank you, Master!

883
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:49,402
She's up there!

884
00:55:53,198 --> 00:55:54,782
Mum, is Dad really back?

885
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,243
I lied to spare us!
We'll clear the house, then...

886
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,161
- go to the city and find your father.
- Oh, alright!

887
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:02,582
He's back!

888
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,584
His expression isn't good!

889
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:11,716
Stop there!

890
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:15,553
Were you going to tell me
you're getting married?!

891
00:56:16,054 --> 00:56:17,305
What kind of mother are you?

892
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:20,141
I'm in the city a few days and you let
our son move in with the bride's family?!

893
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:22,059
How can I face our Fong family ancestors?

894
00:56:22,227 --> 00:56:24,187
Dad, I...

895
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:25,271
You shut up!

896
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:28,149
It's not his fault!
It's... my mistake.

897
00:56:28,483 --> 00:56:32,403
In short, it's all my fault.
I don't know how to teach my son.

898
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:34,781
I... apologise to the
Fong family ancestors!

899
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:36,532
I deserve to die!
I'll slam my head!

900
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,784
- I'll slam myself into the wall!
- Mum...

901
00:56:37,951 --> 00:56:39,661
- This time, I'm serious! Let me go!
- Don't... slam your head into the wall!

902
00:56:39,828 --> 00:56:41,746
- I'll slam my head!
- Mum, it's your second slam today!

903
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:44,749
- Forget it... I have to go out.
- Stop holding me! Let me go!

904
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:47,126
I'll talk about this with you tomorrow.

905
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:49,879
What?!
Hey!

906
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:54,300
I'm... just about to die!
And you're going to leave, huh?

907
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,010
Hey, are you a man or not?

908
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:58,304
You won't try to save me,
not even from death?

909
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,730
This is for you.

910
00:57:19,826 --> 00:57:21,577
It's a razor for shaving!

911
00:57:21,745 --> 00:57:23,371
He bought it for me.

912
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:25,581
It's for shaving my leg hair!

913
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,335
Mum, it's raining.

914
00:57:29,502 --> 00:57:32,046
Your father forgot to take an umbrella.
Hurry and bring him one.

915
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:44,768
Why is it suddenly raining so heavily?

916
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:48,062
- Be careful!
- This umbrella's leaking! Change it!

917
00:58:06,414 --> 00:58:08,207
- Mum, it's stopped raining!
- Right.

918
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,211
- Someone's making noise in there!
- What?

919
00:58:20,428 --> 00:58:21,804
Alright, don't cry.

920
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:23,223
Bastard!

921
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,974
Mum, don't be so impulsive!

922
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:26,725
I don't want to live!

923
00:58:27,352 --> 00:58:29,354
I hope you don't think
it's all meaningless.

924
00:58:30,313 --> 00:58:32,356
There's a child in your belly.

925
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:34,233
The bastard got her pregnant!

926
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:37,779
Don't worry.
There's a child in your belly.

927
00:58:38,029 --> 00:58:40,031
It's my responsibility
to take care of it.

928
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:43,534
- We're all responsible.
- This whore has so many men?!

929
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:46,120
Dad,
they're claiming responsibility.

930
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:47,830
Back out while you can.

931
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:52,584
If Fourth Brother hadn't saved me,
you wouldn't have become a widow.

932
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:55,838
It would've been impossible for
me to smuggle out this register.

933
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:59,050
Pfft!
Turns out, Dad isn't having an affair!

934
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,761
He almost scared me to death!

935
00:59:01,928 --> 00:59:03,679
Mum, don't make so much noise!

936
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:05,265
Who's there?
Come out!

937
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:06,683
Don't go!

938
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:18,862
- What's that sound?
- Firecrackers.

939
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:20,321
- Firecrackers?
- Right!

940
00:59:25,702 --> 00:59:27,537
Look at how your hands shake.

941
00:59:27,704 --> 00:59:29,706
You don't seem to be a
martial arts practitioner.

942
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:31,916
Why aren't you out on serious business...

943
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,251
instead of rebelling against
the Qing to restore the Ming?

944
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:35,962
We each serve our own masters.

945
00:59:36,421 --> 00:59:39,507
In your mind,
Qianlong may be a good emperor.

946
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:42,510
But in the minds of the Han people,
he's not a good emperor.

947
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:47,177
Hand me the register and you
can enjoy wealth and status.

948
00:59:47,515 --> 00:59:50,559
For my own wealth and status,
I'd be sacrificing so many lives.

949
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:52,687
Even if I was willing,
my brothers wouldn't be.

950
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,189
And even if they were willing,
my wife would never forgive me.

951
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:57,316
I'd forgive you!
Boss, I'd definitely forgive you!

952
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,445
So you're selling me out?!

953
01:00:00,904 --> 01:00:02,030
Go on!

954
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:21,924
Dad!

955
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:32,977
In my mind,
my dad's a good person.

956
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:34,478
So, I'll take care of you!

957
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:42,612
Let's go!

958
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:54,123
Beat my husband?
I'll deal with you!

959
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:08,930
Mum!

960
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,352
Hang, sweep, split...

961
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:16,103
Dad, where's the register?

962
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:17,355
It's here!

963
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:27,615
Shadowless Hands.

964
01:01:41,629 --> 01:01:43,339
I said it's "Shadowless Hands"!

965
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,222
Sai-Yuk, hurry and save Lok Bing.

966
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,808
Your Mum can take it from here.

967
01:01:55,393 --> 01:01:56,644
Be careful!

968
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:11,325
Well, are you alright?

969
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,912
This hero...
help your father protect the register.

970
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,497
Don't worry,
I won't disappoint you.

971
01:02:16,664 --> 01:02:18,123
Then we'll meet again someday.

972
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,458
Take care.

973
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:23,921
Son, you hold on!
We're leaving!

974
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,382
Don't worry!

975
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:28,509
Joining a triad society?
I'll interrogate you at home!

976
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:14,680
That hurt!

977
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:30,571
Come on!

978
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:33,574
That didn't hurt!

979
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:34,908
Didn't hurt?!

980
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:39,831
Doesn't that hurt...?

981
01:03:41,082 --> 01:03:42,958
That's how my dad beats me!

982
01:03:57,807 --> 01:04:01,060
Let me tell you,
that's how I beat my family dog.

983
01:04:57,784 --> 01:05:01,454
Kid, this is called:
"one inch long, one inch strong".

984
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:04,332
You're ridiculous!
Mine's called: "concise and forceful!"

985
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:20,491
Run, then!
Let's see where you can run?!

986
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:32,294
<i>We'll meet again someday!</i>

987
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:44,557
Dad!

988
01:06:44,724 --> 01:06:46,308
Sai-Yuk,
is anyone following you?

989
01:06:46,476 --> 01:06:49,228
Don't worry, my ten years of kung
fu practise hasn't been in vain.

990
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,647
Where's Mum?

991
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:54,775
Another petty argument?

992
01:06:58,446 --> 01:07:00,823
Mum, are you alright?

993
01:07:02,116 --> 01:07:05,494
He's never treated me like this before.

994
01:07:06,412 --> 01:07:10,416
He recited ten poems in a single breath.

995
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:13,794
Ten poems?
How awesome!

996
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:16,380
Stop bothering me,
I'm still enjoying the excitement!

997
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:20,384
- He's just too stylish!
- That's so romantic!

998
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:21,635
Sai-Yuk!

999
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:24,179
Dad has now chosen his path.

1000
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:26,849
From now on, both mother and
son won't have a good life.

1001
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:33,101
If I can live a good life alone,
then what about the others?

1002
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:36,525
Even if I were willing,
what good can good times do?

1003
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:39,486
Even if I didn't care,
might others be willing?

1004
01:07:39,695 --> 01:07:44,195
And if by some chance the good times
and the others didn't know, then...

1005
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:45,951
Basically, I don't know anything!

1006
01:07:46,118 --> 01:07:49,329
Dad's chosen path must be the right one.
I'll definitely accompany you to the end.

1007
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:51,499
Son, I've no idea what
you're babbling about!

1008
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,584
But I'll accompany you both to the end.

1009
01:07:59,048 --> 01:08:00,883
Since you've made your decision,

1010
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,968
we'll move into Tiger Lei's
home immediately.

1011
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:04,719
That's dangerous!

1012
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:06,931
The more dangerous the place,
the safer it is.

1013
01:08:07,098 --> 01:08:08,015
Understood.

1014
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:14,104
What? Your whole family
is moving into my place?!

1015
01:08:14,272 --> 01:08:16,732
Right.
I didn't want to come at first,

1016
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:19,192
but as my wife says:
Brother Lei is a hero among men.

1017
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,654
You've even managed to turn
this little monkey obedient.

1018
01:08:22,947 --> 01:08:24,114
I didn't know what to believe,

1019
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:27,159
so I decided to bring him here,
to stay for about a month.

1020
01:08:27,326 --> 01:08:30,454
Brother Lei is well-known for
convincing people by virtue.

1021
01:08:32,248 --> 01:08:34,458
I do convince people by virtue!

1022
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,794
Make yourselves at home.

1023
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:39,379
Stay here until you're convinced.

1024
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,177
Miss.

1025
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:47,721
Quickly,
greet your father and mother-in-law.

1026
01:08:49,223 --> 01:08:50,933
Hey, go ahead.

1027
01:08:55,688 --> 01:08:59,274
Wife, I miss you so much!

1028
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:02,861
I'm not your wife!
She's your wife!

1029
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,368
- It's you?!
- It's you?!

1030
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:18,169
You're getting thin!

1031
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:19,669
You, too!

1032
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:37,313
That rascal's such a romantic!

1033
01:09:37,688 --> 01:09:39,189
He inherited that from me.

1034
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:41,484
Come...

1035
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:44,486
What are you doing?
Hey...

1036
01:09:45,821 --> 01:09:48,406
This breastplate is our
Fong family heirloom.

1037
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:51,493
- It's a greeting gift from your in-laws.
- Aren't you going to thank Mum?

1038
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:52,994
Thank you, Mother-in-Law.

1039
01:09:53,412 --> 01:09:56,081
Brother, seeing as most of us
are gathered here today,

1040
01:09:56,290 --> 01:10:00,627
wouldn't it be best to set a date
for them to get married tomorrow?

1041
01:10:01,796 --> 01:10:03,631
Sorry...

1042
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,633
No problem...

1043
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:08,427
I convince people by virtue.

1044
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:11,722
Spray by all means,
spray until you're satisfied.

1045
01:10:12,807 --> 01:10:15,601
Brother, I don't have any
close friends in Guangdong.

1046
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,480
How about asking your relatives and
friends to come join the festivities?

1047
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,857
Co-Mother-in-Law,
tomorrow, ask Dai-Yuk--

1048
01:10:25,152 --> 01:10:27,696
No problem...
I convince people by virtue.

1049
01:10:27,905 --> 01:10:30,532
I don't mind if you
spray my wife with tea.

1050
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:32,951
Admirable...

1051
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:34,745
Alright.

1052
01:10:34,995 --> 01:10:37,497
We convince people by virtue.
Everyone, take an early rest.

1053
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:39,500
Many guests are coming here tomorrow.

1054
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,210
We must rest well.

1055
01:10:41,377 --> 01:10:44,713
Convince people by virtue...

1056
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:06,026
Are you kidding me?
None of your relatives or friends came?

1057
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:11,281
It's just that our Fong family
has a prosperous population.

1058
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:14,493
But as we do business across the country,
more and more branches open.

1059
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,954
I wasn't able to notify all my relatives
and friends in time.

1060
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:21,791
You buy groceries at the wet market.
Don't you have friends there?

1061
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:25,504
Dear Father-in-Law, it's just...

1062
01:11:25,713 --> 01:11:28,966
Our family grows its own vegetables
and doesn't need to buy them.

1063
01:11:30,468 --> 01:11:32,011
Rice, then...?

1064
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:34,305
Rice, too!
We grow our own rice.

1065
01:11:35,264 --> 01:11:37,307
Well, then,
the people who shop from you...

1066
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:38,809
aren't they your friends?

1067
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,478
Right,
they most definitely aren't our friends!

1068
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:44,939
If they were, would I sell them shrunken
fabrics and charge random prices?

1069
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:47,609
Actually, running our cloth store
is much like running a brothel.

1070
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:49,069
If you're willing to buy,
we're willing to sell.

1071
01:11:49,236 --> 01:11:51,655
Everyone has flings,
no need to invest true feeling.

1072
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:53,698
So how could they be our friends?
Am I right...?

1073
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:55,242
Good answer...

1074
01:11:58,954 --> 01:12:00,956
Master, the Lord Prefect's here.

1075
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:03,709
Finally a guest has come.
Please hurry...

1076
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:07,379
Don't worry, it's only the Prefect.

1077
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,922
It's only the Prefect!

1078
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:10,507
- Brother Lei!
- Lord Prefect!

1079
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:12,008
The Commander of the Nine Gates has come.

1080
01:12:12,259 --> 01:12:13,551
My Lord...

1081
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:15,971
- Please...
- Welcome, My Lord.

1082
01:12:17,473 --> 01:12:20,517
Hey, in-laws...
let's greet our guests together.

1083
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:22,686
Come... let's go together.
Come on!

1084
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:25,772
My Lord, please...

1085
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:29,860
Welcome, My Lord.
Your presence honours us.

1086
01:12:30,027 --> 01:12:31,778
- Welcome...
- This is my son-in-law...

1087
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:33,530
- these two are my in-laws.
- My Lord!

1088
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,407
- My Lord!
- My Lord, please take a seat.

1089
01:12:35,574 --> 01:12:38,493
- Please...
- Goodbye... and good riddance...

1090
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,501
Sit as you please.

1091
01:12:45,668 --> 01:12:47,294
- My Lord, please sit.
- Please sit.

1092
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:51,548
Why are you three sitting over there?
Come and sit together!

1093
01:12:51,715 --> 01:12:55,385
No, I see it's crowded with people.
So the three of us are sitting here.

1094
01:12:55,928 --> 01:12:58,430
You're talking rubbish!
Half the table here is unoccupied.

1095
01:12:58,597 --> 01:12:59,556
Come over...

1096
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,224
Oh, dear!
I dropped money!

1097
01:13:01,392 --> 01:13:03,352
- I'll help you find it. Where is it, huh?
- Shit!

1098
01:13:03,561 --> 01:13:05,563
Brother Fong,
why are you sitting alone?

1099
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:07,147
Come sit over here...

1100
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,776
Where's the money?

1101
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:14,404
I can't find it!

1102
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,620
- How long have you been there?
- I-just-got-here!

1103
01:13:21,954 --> 01:13:23,205
- Brother Lei...
- Yes?

1104
01:13:23,372 --> 01:13:25,082
What's your son-in-law
doing under the table?

1105
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,501
What are you doing there?
Come out...

1106
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:31,797
Your favourite meal of
braised pork is here.

1107
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:37,761
Son, you eat up!

1108
01:13:41,056 --> 01:13:42,640
Mum,
it's no good for him to see me.

1109
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,476
To the right...

1110
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:53,151
<i>He's</i> your son-in-law?

1111
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:56,488
Family Head Lei,
tell My Lord who Sai-Yuk is to you!

1112
01:13:56,906 --> 01:13:58,282
He's my son-in-law!

1113
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,075
Are you head of the family?

1114
01:14:00,242 --> 01:14:02,953
Yes, I'm in charge here.

1115
01:14:03,245 --> 01:14:05,622
- Hand over the register!
- Master, watch out!

1116
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:08,208
Xiaohuan!

1117
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:09,877
Mum!

1118
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:11,127
Tingting!

1119
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:12,670
Where's the register?

1120
01:14:26,226 --> 01:14:27,602
I'll fight you to the death!

1121
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:29,854
Mum!

1122
01:14:30,522 --> 01:14:31,981
Flip over the table as cover!

1123
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:34,526
Quick, let's go!

1124
01:14:34,985 --> 01:14:36,611
Xiaohuan...

1125
01:14:38,364 --> 01:14:40,366
Master, be careful!

1126
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:53,419
- Go on!
- Yes!

1127
01:15:04,431 --> 01:15:05,849
Take him back.

1128
01:15:06,016 --> 01:15:08,184
Set fire to their house
and burn it down.

1129
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:16,652
Fucking hell!
Fucking little bastard!

1130
01:15:17,069 --> 01:15:18,695
I was letting you marry my daughter,

1131
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:21,072
but you've brought misery
to my entire family.

1132
01:15:22,658 --> 01:15:25,577
Master Lei,
our young master didn't want this.

1133
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:27,704
You shut up!
Speak again and I'll kill you!

1134
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,582
Let him go,
or I won't be polite to you.

1135
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:32,709
Fucking hell!
You want to fight?

1136
01:15:33,836 --> 01:15:36,046
- What do you want?
- Master Yuk, forget it.

1137
01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:38,674
Dad, Mum's in real trouble!

1138
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:39,841
Fuck!

1139
01:15:41,427 --> 01:15:42,636
Xiaohuan!

1140
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:45,889
- Tingting!
- Mum!

1141
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:47,390
Where's your father?

1142
01:15:48,267 --> 01:15:51,353
Xiaohuan... how do you feel?

1143
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:54,231
- Hurry up...
- Go see a doctor!

1144
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:56,984
No need for you to worry!
Don't I know what to do?

1145
01:15:59,028 --> 01:16:01,488
Piss off, you!
Don't touch her!

1146
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:05,075
- Don't do this, she's hurt so badly.
- Xiaohuan, let's go!

1147
01:16:05,242 --> 01:16:07,035
- Be careful!
- Brother, Guangdong is unfamiliar to you.

1148
01:16:07,202 --> 01:16:08,119
We'll take you there.

1149
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:09,746
No need, you couldn't care less!

1150
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:11,039
From now on,
we go our separate ways.

1151
01:16:11,206 --> 01:16:12,624
Dad, that's no good.

1152
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,584
We're not familiar with
the roads in Guangdong.

1153
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:15,836
Are you coming or not?

1154
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:17,921
Don't come,
and you're no longer my daughter!

1155
01:16:18,088 --> 01:16:18,922
Tingting!

1156
01:16:19,214 --> 01:16:20,298
Let's go!

1157
01:16:22,885 --> 01:16:24,553
Let's go!
Let's go now!

1158
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:27,722
Mum doesn't have any ideas yet.

1159
01:16:29,308 --> 01:16:30,892
Don't worry about it.

1160
01:16:31,351 --> 01:16:34,854
As long as the register's in our hands,
they won't do anything to Dad.

1161
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:36,481
I'll check out the city tonight.

1162
01:16:36,648 --> 01:16:37,732
You be careful!

1163
01:16:52,498 --> 01:16:54,500
- Bamboo Pole!
- Who's there?

1164
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:55,834
Sai-Yuk.

1165
01:16:57,461 --> 01:16:58,628
Open the door.

1166
01:17:02,007 --> 01:17:03,133
Come in!

1167
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:06,386
I've seen notices all around.

1168
01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:08,471
They say my Dad's going
to be beheaded tomorrow.

1169
01:17:08,806 --> 01:17:10,557
Many people I know were arrested today.

1170
01:17:10,808 --> 01:17:12,559
So I came to check you
two brothers were alright.

1171
01:17:12,768 --> 01:17:17,268
I'm alright...

1172
01:17:20,776 --> 01:17:22,068
What's wrong?

1173
01:17:23,278 --> 01:17:27,282
Master Yuk, I've let you down...

1174
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:31,703
You don't have to cry.
What's happened?

1175
01:17:31,912 --> 01:17:34,915
They took me and Bronze Hammer Six
in for questioning.

1176
01:17:35,457 --> 01:17:39,794
I said, I didn't know you.
So that's why I'm alright.

1177
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:45,133
What about Six?

1178
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:48,929
He blamed me for having
no guts or loyalty.

1179
01:17:49,972 --> 01:17:52,182
He refused to disown you
even if it meant death.

1180
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:56,186
So they beat him until he vomited blood.
He was beaten until they were exhausted.

1181
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:58,855
At first, they told him if he kowtowed
three times they'd let him go.

1182
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,481
He refused to kowtow
even on the verge of death.

1183
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,525
Where is he now?

1184
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:07,777
He was beaten to death...
and hung at the East Gate.

1185
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:13,077
Master Yuk, will you forgive me?

1186
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:15,664
I was so scared!

1187
01:18:15,998 --> 01:18:17,499
I won't blame you.

1188
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:20,585
I've already lost one friend,
I don't want to bury you, too.

1189
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:28,927
Who's there?

1190
01:18:29,428 --> 01:18:31,680
Hey, what are you doing here...?

1191
01:18:31,889 --> 01:18:33,390
I came to collect his corpse.

1192
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:35,601
Who are you to dare collect his corpse?

1193
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:40,772
Fong Sai-Yuk.

1194
01:18:41,023 --> 01:18:42,315
Fong Sai-Yuk...?!

1195
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:44,442
You dare to come here?
Aren't you afraid of death?

1196
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:48,614
My friend wasn't afraid of death,
he dared to recognise me.

1197
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:53,906
How could it be that I, Fong Sai-Yuk... am
too afraid of death to collect his corpse?

1198
01:18:55,037 --> 01:18:56,246
- Go on!
- Yes...

1199
01:19:26,693 --> 01:19:29,696
Six, let's fight side by side!

1200
01:20:13,031 --> 01:20:15,324
Kowtow to my friend three times!

1201
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:22,082
Don't blame us...
It's not our fault...

1202
01:20:35,595 --> 01:20:38,014
Six, let's go!

1203
01:20:42,352 --> 01:20:44,437
You mustn't blame us!

1204
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:15,469
Bronze Hammer Six,
you were a good friend to me in this life.

1205
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:18,430
I hope we can be good
brothers in the next.

1206
01:21:22,684 --> 01:21:25,478
Master Yuk, restrain your grief.

1207
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:30,066
Mushroom, Dad will be beheaded
at the execution ground tomorrow.

1208
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:33,611
You're saying that
Master will be beheaded?

1209
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:35,530
I've decided to save him alone.

1210
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:37,782
Take Mum away early in the morning.

1211
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:41,285
Master Yuk,
it's dangerous for you to go alone.

1212
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:43,496
- Don't!
- Say no more!

1213
01:21:43,663 --> 01:21:45,081
I've already made my decision.

1214
01:21:45,374 --> 01:21:47,834
You mustn't let Mum know about this.

1215
01:21:50,003 --> 01:21:52,380
Mushroom...

1216
01:21:52,839 --> 01:21:54,048
Don't cry.

1217
01:21:54,466 --> 01:21:55,800
Mum's waiting for us inside.

1218
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:58,177
We'll go back in first.
Let's go.

1219
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:04,934
Well?
Any news about your father?

1220
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:07,270
It's alright, don't worry!

1221
01:22:07,854 --> 01:22:11,399
Turns out, Dad was rescued by Chan Ga-Lok,
Chief Helmsman of the Red Flower Society.

1222
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:12,608
Really?

1223
01:22:12,776 --> 01:22:14,986
Why would I lie to you?

1224
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:16,821
So why hasn't he come back?

1225
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:20,575
Oh, Chief Helmsman Chan said, it's best
for everyone not to concentrate together.

1226
01:22:20,784 --> 01:22:23,036
That's why he instructed Mushroom
to take you tomorrow...

1227
01:22:23,203 --> 01:22:25,955
to meet him at the Boshui Beach
branch of the Red Flower Society.

1228
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:31,127
Mushroom, isn't there a branch of the
Red Flower Society at Boshui Beach?

1229
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:33,171
You say it!
Tell Mum, then!

1230
01:22:33,338 --> 01:22:34,464
Say it!

1231
01:22:35,006 --> 01:22:37,800
Right, I went there with Master
year before last.

1232
01:22:38,051 --> 01:22:40,053
What about you?
Are you just by yourself?

1233
01:22:40,846 --> 01:22:45,346
Chief Chan asked me to take the register
to Mount Longhu and join a Master Chiu.

1234
01:22:46,852 --> 01:22:48,728
Isn't there a Master Chiu at Mount Longhu?

1235
01:22:48,895 --> 01:22:49,979
Say it!
Why aren't you saying anything?

1236
01:22:50,147 --> 01:22:51,189
Say it, then!

1237
01:22:51,356 --> 01:22:53,775
Right,
we met the year before last.

1238
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:55,360
We had dinner together.

1239
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:58,321
That Master Chiu,
he's a real nice guy!

1240
01:22:58,613 --> 01:22:59,822
Did I get it right?

1241
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:02,158
Right, not a single mistake!

1242
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:04,327
Then, all's well that ends well.

1243
01:23:04,494 --> 01:23:06,412
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

1244
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:13,378
You Cantonese,
there's not a good one among you!

1245
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:16,047
They said they'd find
a doctor to cure my wife.

1246
01:23:16,214 --> 01:23:18,925
Turns out, they called officers
to come and arrest me.

1247
01:23:19,509 --> 01:23:23,262
You Cantonese... are all motherfuckers!

1248
01:23:24,556 --> 01:23:26,558
Wife, how are you?

1249
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:30,186
Tingting...

1250
01:23:32,022 --> 01:23:33,189
I'm alright.

1251
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:34,482
It's pouring down,
get on board first.

1252
01:23:34,649 --> 01:23:37,610
I don't need your care!
I won't get on your boat!

1253
01:23:37,777 --> 01:23:40,362
I'm warning you,
don't you come near me in future!

1254
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:41,656
Dad!

1255
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:43,407
Don't you talk to me!

1256
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:44,951
Tingting.

1257
01:23:45,118 --> 01:23:48,037
Mother-in-Law's seriously injured.
Why are you so stubborn?

1258
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:51,333
Tingting, get on board with them!

1259
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:56,041
I'll... stay here with your father.

1260
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,591
Damn you, asshole!
Saving face at a time like this?!

1261
01:24:01,218 --> 01:24:03,637
Fucking hell!
Haven't you scolded me enough?

1262
01:24:03,929 --> 01:24:05,639
I only said <i>I</i> wouldn't
get on your boat.

1263
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:09,350
I never said anything about my wife
and daughter not going on board.

1264
01:24:09,559 --> 01:24:11,227
Say no more.
Help her up.

1265
01:24:13,063 --> 01:24:14,272
Be careful!

1266
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,484
- Watch out.
- Be careful...

1267
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,448
Don't let her fall!

1268
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:24,908
Be careful.

1269
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:35,251
God!
What the hell did I do wrong?

1270
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:38,129
Why do you treat me this way?

1271
01:24:41,091 --> 01:24:42,884
A man with a rotten mouth
deserves to be struck by lightning!

1272
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:44,552
I'll ask you once more:
are you boarding or not?

1273
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,053
I'm not...

1274
01:24:46,763 --> 01:24:50,016
- You have to hang in there.
- Mum...

1275
01:24:50,225 --> 01:24:54,229
Sai-Yuk,
take Tingting out for a while.

1276
01:24:54,813 --> 01:24:59,234
I have something important...
to tell co-Mother-in-Law.

1277
01:25:00,986 --> 01:25:03,571
Go on!
Good girl!

1278
01:25:10,495 --> 01:25:14,995
Co-Mother-in-Law,
I have something to ask you...

1279
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:18,043
What is it?

1280
01:25:23,883 --> 01:25:25,885
Where is Dai-Yuk?

1281
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:32,679
Dai... Dai-Yuk is here.

1282
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:45,529
"The beauty rolls up the beaded curtain."

1283
01:25:49,034 --> 01:25:52,954
"She sits,
her eyebrows knitted deep."

1284
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:57,083
"But visible are traces of tears."

1285
01:25:57,542 --> 01:25:59,794
"Not knowing who her heart hates."

1286
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:03,380
Madam, it's me!

1287
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:05,383
Dai-Yuk!

1288
01:26:06,384 --> 01:26:08,386
Are you really Dai-Yuk?

1289
01:26:10,096 --> 01:26:11,514
Yes!

1290
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,940
We can't be together in this life.

1291
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:30,112
I hope we can be together
in the next life, OK?

1292
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:36,873
OK.

1293
01:26:53,556 --> 01:26:54,807
Co-Mother-in-Law!

1294
01:26:54,974 --> 01:26:55,975
Mum!

1295
01:26:56,142 --> 01:26:58,936
Xiaohuan!

1296
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:07,612
Although you always scold me,

1297
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:10,865
in my heart,
I can't be angry with you.

1298
01:27:12,575 --> 01:27:17,075
Once you're my father-in-law,
you're my father-in-law for life.

1299
01:27:18,415 --> 01:27:21,835
Once your boat passes Boshui
Beach tomorrow morning...

1300
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,420
the officers can't catch you.

1301
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:43,857
Xiaohuan!

1302
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:54,158
Xiaohuan!

1303
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:22,979
Sai-Yuk, remember to come and
join us as soon as you're done.

1304
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:26,857
Master Yuk, take care of yourself!

1305
01:28:27,025 --> 01:28:29,527
Damn it, you're crying?
You're crazy!

1306
01:28:29,778 --> 01:28:32,155
He's not going to die, he's going
to deliver the register, that's all.

1307
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:34,783
I caught a cold is all!

1308
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:37,326
Say no more, it's time to go.

1309
01:28:37,786 --> 01:28:39,078
Dad's waiting for you.

1310
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:40,246
Oh!

1311
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:44,918
- Sai-Yuk!
- What's the matter?

1312
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:47,920
Can you swear an oath?

1313
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:49,421
What oath?

1314
01:28:49,798 --> 01:28:54,093
Swear that you won't recognise me as
your wife in future, will you agree?

1315
01:28:54,552 --> 01:28:55,553
Why?

1316
01:28:56,554 --> 01:28:58,055
That night in the bridal chamber,
you said...

1317
01:28:58,223 --> 01:28:59,140
What did I say?

1318
01:28:59,307 --> 01:29:02,143
If you took me as your wife,
then...

1319
01:29:03,478 --> 01:29:04,896
My whole family would die?

1320
01:29:06,648 --> 01:29:07,899
I don't care!

1321
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:12,069
No matter what happens,
you'll always be my wife.

1322
01:29:18,618 --> 01:29:20,703
His father used to kiss me like that.

1323
01:29:20,995 --> 01:29:24,331
Hey,
did you ever kiss your wife like that?

1324
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,376
Forget I said that!

1325
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:28,920
Foul mouth!

1326
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:32,256
Put this on.

1327
01:29:32,423 --> 01:29:33,549
What about you?

1328
01:29:35,677 --> 01:29:36,886
I have this one.

1329
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:39,764
- You're still wearing that?
- <i>Master Yuk, time to set sail.</i>

1330
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:41,682
Take care.

1331
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:54,027
Sai-Yuk, be careful...

1332
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:58,198
You don't want to go walking!
Ride a horse.

1333
01:29:58,366 --> 01:30:00,076
It's faster, you understand?

1334
01:30:00,243 --> 01:30:03,454
Also, wear enough shirts,
so you don't catch a cold.

1335
01:30:03,663 --> 01:30:05,122
Take some rations...

1336
01:30:13,715 --> 01:30:15,216
All of you, take care.

1337
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,094
As long as you hand over the
Red Flower Society rebels...

1338
01:31:00,637 --> 01:31:04,098
and give me the register,
you won't die!

1339
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:06,016
We Han people won't betray our own.

1340
01:31:06,184 --> 01:31:09,187
As long as the Manchus return to
Manchuria... we won't oppose you.

1341
01:31:09,354 --> 01:31:12,982
For many years our great Qing dynasty
has united the whole of China.

1342
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:17,111
It's just that you aren't
willing to face reality.

1343
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:22,199
You see,
haven't we ample food and clothing?

1344
01:31:23,326 --> 01:31:25,202
Don't we have peace and prosperity?

1345
01:31:26,496 --> 01:31:28,831
- You hear that?
- Shut up!

1346
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:31,751
I'll kill anyone who makes a noise.

1347
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:35,629
I'm asking you,
where are the Red Flower Society men?

1348
01:31:35,797 --> 01:31:38,382
Wherever there's a heaven and an earth,
there are Red Flower Society men.

1349
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:39,883
How many can you kill?

1350
01:31:40,051 --> 01:31:43,512
Fine.
I kill one, that's one less.

1351
01:31:43,805 --> 01:31:45,181
Carry out the execution.

1352
01:31:55,984 --> 01:31:58,194
It's really so tragic!

1353
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:07,453
Chop!

1354
01:32:11,457 --> 01:32:12,833
<i>The register's here!</i>

1355
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,043
Terrific!

1356
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:16,545
Today, Fong Sai-Yuk and the Red Flower
Society advance and retreat together.

1357
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:20,090
I live, the register survives.
I die, it dies with me.

1358
01:33:06,345 --> 01:33:07,512
Sai-Yuk!

1359
01:33:22,695 --> 01:33:24,530
Don't come over,
or I'll blow this up!

1360
01:33:24,697 --> 01:33:25,823
Back off!

1361
01:33:26,407 --> 01:33:27,616
Retreat!

1362
01:33:27,909 --> 01:33:30,578
Fong Sai-Yuk,
you're brave enough, indeed!

1363
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,955
Don't tell me you aren't afraid?!

1364
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:36,500
Today, my fate is predetermined!

1365
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:41,167
Hand over the register,
and neither you nor your father will die.

1366
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:45,551
Sai-Yuk...
you mustn't give it to him!

1367
01:33:49,055 --> 01:33:51,640
A wise man submits to circumstances.

1368
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:53,976
As long as you hand
the register over to me,

1369
01:33:54,143 --> 01:33:58,643
I guarantee you a bright future
and promotion to the nobility.

1370
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,817
You stupid dick!
You want to turn me into a traitor?

1371
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,402
My Dad would disown me!
My Mum would cripple me!

1372
01:34:03,569 --> 01:34:05,779
The people would curse me!
History would revile me!

1373
01:34:05,947 --> 01:34:08,908
The country needs someone whose name won't
go down in history as a byword for infamy.

1374
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,911
Terrific!
How ambitious!

1375
01:34:13,788 --> 01:34:16,373
You have guts.
I admire your kind the most.

1376
01:34:16,749 --> 01:34:18,375
If we didn't each serve our own master,

1377
01:34:18,543 --> 01:34:21,337
I could discuss heroes with
you today over a cup of wine.

1378
01:34:21,546 --> 01:34:23,714
Alright, I'll give you a chance.

1379
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:30,508
If you can beat me before the rope breaks,
I'll help you be a filial son.

1380
01:34:31,222 --> 01:34:35,184
If you lose,
you hand over the register to me.

1381
01:35:31,073 --> 01:35:33,283
I only used 30% of my power last time.

1382
01:35:33,492 --> 01:35:35,243
I think you're a martial arts prodigy.

1383
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:37,496
I had wanted to promote you
to serve the imperial court.

1384
01:35:37,705 --> 01:35:40,124
But now it seems,
you won't have the chance.

1385
01:35:52,553 --> 01:35:54,137
I'm proficient in many fists.

1386
01:35:54,972 --> 01:35:56,640
I had wanted to take you as my apprentice.

1387
01:35:57,683 --> 01:36:01,353
But as you bullied my dad...
I can see you won't have the chance.

1388
01:36:17,328 --> 01:36:19,038
Lucky I have a breastplate.

1389
01:37:59,597 --> 01:38:01,473
Go to hell!

1390
01:38:38,844 --> 01:38:40,053
It's yours!

1391
01:39:04,578 --> 01:39:07,289
Sai-Yuk, you must go now!

1392
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:10,166
I won't go...

1393
01:39:10,334 --> 01:39:14,588
Sai-Yuk, Dad is so happy
to have seen you grow up.

1394
01:39:15,005 --> 01:39:16,172
Don't bother about me.

1395
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,467
Besides, there are many
important things for you to do.

1396
01:39:19,051 --> 01:39:21,845
Even if Dad dies,
he'll be without regrets.

1397
01:39:22,304 --> 01:39:23,680
You must go now!

1398
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:26,517
Whatever I have to do,
anyone can do it!

1399
01:39:26,684 --> 01:39:28,560
But I only have one dad!

1400
01:39:33,858 --> 01:39:34,984
You must go!

1401
01:39:35,151 --> 01:39:38,112
Dad,
I want to live and die with you.

1402
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:47,454
- Fong Sai-Yuk, let me help you!
- Mum...

1403
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,999
I'll help you, too!

1404
01:39:55,045 --> 01:39:56,629
Exert yourself!

1405
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:17,359
FUCK YOUR MOTHER!

1406
01:40:18,569 --> 01:40:20,070
Kill them for me!

1407
01:40:23,741 --> 01:40:25,951
Husband!

1408
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:29,079
Sai-Yuk!

1409
01:40:29,246 --> 01:40:31,581
Mum's here to save you!

1410
01:40:45,387 --> 01:40:47,555
Stupid boy!
Trying to get yourself killed?

1411
01:40:47,723 --> 01:40:49,349
Think I'm not ready to die?!

1412
01:40:50,309 --> 01:40:51,560
Mushroom,
why do you bring my mum here?

1413
01:40:51,727 --> 01:40:53,770
I didn't, turns out there <i>is</i> a Red
Flower Society branch at Boshui Beach.

1414
01:40:53,938 --> 01:40:55,147
- What a coincidence!
- Yeah...

1415
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:58,526
Master Yuk, your bullshit was spot on!
Don't talk nonsense any more!

1416
01:40:58,692 --> 01:40:59,734
Quick, go save my Dad!

1417
01:41:00,444 --> 01:41:02,446
I'm ready to die...

1418
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,450
You go to hell!

1419
01:41:07,076 --> 01:41:11,497
I'm ready to die...

1420
01:41:12,498 --> 01:41:13,832
How come I'm not yet dead?

1421
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,084
Chief Helmsman Chan!

1422
01:41:40,526 --> 01:41:41,777
Husband, are you alright?

1423
01:41:41,944 --> 01:41:43,570
I'm fine, let's save Dad!

1424
01:41:44,154 --> 01:41:45,155
Dad!

1425
01:41:45,698 --> 01:41:47,241
Mum, let's save Dad!

1426
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:54,707
Master, let's go now!

1427
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,181
Chief Helmsman Chan,
your reputation is fully justified.

1428
01:42:11,807 --> 01:42:13,016
Admirable.

1429
01:42:15,436 --> 01:42:19,481
However, my master ordered me
to bring back your corpse!

1430
01:42:25,362 --> 01:42:27,364
Flying stinky shoe!

1431
01:42:30,284 --> 01:42:31,827
Guided flying spear!

1432
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:40,502
Mum!

1433
01:42:51,805 --> 01:42:53,473
Brother Fong,
I'll adopt Sai-Yuk as my godson.

1434
01:42:53,641 --> 01:42:54,558
I'll surely teach him well.

1435
01:42:54,725 --> 01:42:57,185
Chief Chan,
I'm handing Sai-Yuk over to you.

1436
01:42:57,561 --> 01:42:58,562
Thief Chan!

1437
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:00,397
Umm, sorry!
Chief Chan!

1438
01:43:00,564 --> 01:43:02,107
Look after my son well, please.

1439
01:43:02,274 --> 01:43:04,025
He hasn't left me since he was a child.

1440
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:07,946
Chief Helmsman Chan,
it's time for us to part company.

1441
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,073
Godfather,
can I take Tingting with me?

1442
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,199
Of course, you can.

1443
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:12,826
Husband,
have you thought it through?

1444
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:14,786
You're really booting
your son into the Triad?

1445
01:43:14,995 --> 01:43:16,496
Have <i>you</i> thought it through?

1446
01:43:16,705 --> 01:43:19,124
Alright, then...
he should go out and see the big picture.

1447
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,500
Tingting, let's go.

1448
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,921
Dad.

1449
01:43:25,798 --> 01:43:29,009
Don't you bully my daughter.
Take care I don't beat you!

1450
01:43:29,176 --> 01:43:31,094
Don't worry,
I haven't the will to bully her.

1451
01:43:31,261 --> 01:43:32,971
Be good like me when
you travel the country.

1452
01:43:33,138 --> 01:43:34,514
Convince people with virtue,
understand?

1453
01:43:34,682 --> 01:43:35,599
Yes!

1454
01:43:38,227 --> 01:43:40,229
Dad,
can I beg you for just one thing?

1455
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:41,605
Say it.

1456
01:43:41,772 --> 01:43:43,482
From when I was little,
I've never seen you smile.

1457
01:43:43,649 --> 01:43:44,900
Let me see you smile.

1458
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:46,401
I'll smile next year!

1459
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:50,280
Sai-Yuk, let's go.

1460
01:43:51,156 --> 01:43:52,866
Dad, take care of yourself.

1461
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:54,159
Let's go!

1462
01:43:55,786 --> 01:43:57,120
Sai-Yuk, sit steady.

1463
01:43:57,955 --> 01:43:59,331
You won't bully me, will you?

1464
01:43:59,498 --> 01:44:00,832
"The beauty rolls up the beaded curtain."

1465
01:44:00,999 --> 01:44:02,542
"She sits,
her eyebrows knitted deep."

1466
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,961
"But visible are traces of tears."

1467
01:44:04,128 --> 01:44:05,754
"Not knowing who her heart hates."

1468
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:11,509
Son, your Dad's smiling!

1469
01:44:12,136 --> 01:44:14,888
It's really romantic!
I'm so happy!

1470
01:44:17,182 --> 01:44:20,643
Sai-Yuk,
haven't you forgotten something?

1471
01:44:21,145 --> 01:44:22,229
Catch!
