1
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:46,553
Kit...

2
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,768
Kit!

3
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:23,257
- Two dollars' worth!
- OK!

4
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:31,849
- Mark!
- Coming!

5
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:40,692
Hey! Don't forget your plate...

6
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,237
Sir!

7
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,868
Taste good?

8
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,823
You feeling alright?

9
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,582
- Take this and go see a doctor...
- Thank you, Brother Mark...

10
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,428
You can read?

11
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:16,931
Huh?

12
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:19,641
If you can't read, don't pretend...

13
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,182
Hi!

14
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,002
Oh, hi Tom. How are you?

15
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:34,927
Hi Russ.

16
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,280
Hi.

17
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:39,216
Tom, good to see you.
How are things?

18
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,102
Ah, thanks.

19
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,593
That's heavy.

20
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,648
That's great.
First class.

21
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,798
Hey, why don't we go out
for a drink sometime?

22
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:26,141
Tom. It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

23
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,010
Very good! Your English
is getting better...

24
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,594
You even know "of course"...

25
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,430
Of course!

26
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,059
Good morning, Brother Mark!
Good morning, Mr. Sung!

27
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,936
Good morning!

28
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,939
- Good morning, Mr. Sung!
- Good morning!

29
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:51,984
Brother Mark, good morning!

30
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,987
"Brother Mark"...
I like the way that sounds!

31
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,367
- Mr. Yiu!
- Ho, you're back!

32
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,411
- Did it go OK?
- I counted it already...

33
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:04,914
- That's great.
- Those foreigners are easygoing...

34
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:07,875
Not every foreigner is
as considerate as them...

35
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,461
Your weakness is that
you are too easily taken in...

36
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,671
You're Shing? Have a seat...

37
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,715
No, thanks.
It's better for me to stand.

38
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,973
Good morning, Linda!

39
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:30,022
Like a rose...

40
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,817
Shing, you can learn a lot
from Brother Ho...

41
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,819
He's extremely loyal!

42
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,406
True, but I could never
be as good as Brother Ho...

43
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:43,327
Mark here is a bit silly,
but he'll always have your back...

44
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:45,371
Yes, Brother Mark
takes good care of me...

45
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,290
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing... Just talking about you...

46
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,959
Really?

47
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:53,629
Your little brother Kit graduates today...

48
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,882
Oh! I forgot...

49
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,341
I've got to get him a gift...

50
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,593
I should get going...

51
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,428
Ho...

52
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:05,016
When you go to Taiwan the day after next,
take Shing with you.

53
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,894
Give the kid a chance!

54
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,981
Taiwan! Don't go thinking
it's "Chai-wan"...

55
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,191
I've spent decades in this <i>jianghu</i> world,
but I still don't dare go there!

56
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,235
You want to know why? The gangsters
there use drills! And cleavers!

57
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,154
Just drinking the beer there can kill you!

58
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:20,114
- Quit playing tricks on him...
- Oh, OK...

59
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,033
You should give Kit a girl
as a graduation present...

60
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,201
I'm a bad guy, but I don't
want him to be like me...

61
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,954
Still better to have a hooker...

62
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,082
I want to see him get a doctorate...

63
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,708
Get married in a church...

64
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,252
Start a life, and have a baby...

65
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,005
You'll be as busy as a buffalo
just keeping up...

66
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:41,052
I've heard that people with dirty mouths
will step in shit getting on an elevator...

67
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,386
Then after you...

68
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:48,017
- You first!
- I won't...

69
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,518
Then we'll step in it together!

70
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,038
Hold it! Police!

71
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,331
- Spread 'em!
- Yes, sir...

72
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,874
- Don't move!
- This isn't funny...

73
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,459
Face the wall!

74
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,211
We both have guns...

75
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,921
If you don't treat me with respect,
I'll treat you the same way...

76
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,631
We'll see who gets less respect!

77
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,638
Too ticklish!

78
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,391
- No, don't! Please...
- You sure?

79
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,392
Brother...

80
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,519
I've got some news
sure to give you a surprise!

81
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,981
I passed the officer's exam!

82
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,441
Surprise!

83
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,402
Then you've got to work hard...

84
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,280
You've got to make
superintendent at least...

85
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,907
Jackie!

86
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,700
This is my girlfriend... When she is free
she comes by to look after Dad...

87
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,036
- Hi!
- My big brother!

88
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,835
So this is how she takes care of Dad...

89
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,508
- Thanks for your help...
- Don't mention it...

90
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,552
I've got to get to an interview...

91
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,848
What are you waiting for?
You should make it official with her...

92
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,809
First I'll see how it goes this afternoon
and let you know later...

93
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,898
You said you'll go with me!
Hurry up!

94
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:18,440
I really want to stay and
look after Dad, but...

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,859
No need to explain, go!

96
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,028
- Then I'll be going...
- Go!

97
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,112
Sorry...

98
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,656
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

99
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,491
Bye bye!

100
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,668
- Ho!
- Dad...

101
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,254
You should quit...

102
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:43,841
Your brother has never known
what line of work you are in...

103
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,427
I remember when you two were little...

104
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:48,470
You would always play
cops and robbers together...

105
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,764
He always lost...

106
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,434
But he wanted to be a cop anyways...

107
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:57,521
Now that you are both grown, I don't
want to see you play that game again...

108
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,650
So do it for your brother...

109
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,529
OK?

110
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,115
OK...

111
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,502
That's the last one...

112
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,296
Excuse me... I'm sorry...
The traffic is terrible!

113
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,339
Yeah, the traffic is completely jammed!

114
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,924
- I'm Jackie...
- Sir... traffic...

115
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,551
- Please give me a chance...
- Give her a chance, OK?

116
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,762
- Are you OK? Aren't you pregnant...
- You alright?

117
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:33,599
Sir, the traffic just now is really bad...
Give her a chance, please...

118
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,766
OK, OK...

119
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:37,769
Great! Let's go!

120
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,069
- To hit a pregnant lady...
- How awful!

121
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:48,322
Hey, judges! Listen up...

122
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,188
Excuse me...

123
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,029
It was all your fault!
You made me look like a fool!

124
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,863
You didn't help me one bit!

125
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,491
When you don't have confidence
in yourself, how can I help you?

126
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,286
Besides, the judge didn't say
you failed, so how can you know?

127
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,538
Give it to me!

128
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,585
How can I have any hope now?

129
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,014
Are you sure?

130
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,935
Once this job is finished... I'm done...

131
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,024
Because of Kit?

132
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,240
Don't go with me to Taiwan
to make the buy...

133
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,868
If anything goes wrong,
you'll be here to look after things...

134
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,122
And you can become the new boss...

135
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,377
That's going too far...

136
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,879
Let Shing here stay...

137
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,256
He looks like Al Pacino...

138
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:31,842
Brother Mark, don't make fun of me...

139
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:34,553
Brother Ho, we can't
do this job without you...

140
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,263
I still have a lot of things
to learn from you...

141
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,557
You think you can learn just by watching?

142
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,020
Don't think you can become the boss just
by reading the gangster novels all day...

143
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,566
You ever had the barrel of
a gun against your head?

144
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,069
No, you haven't...

145
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,488
Twelve years ago...

146
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,033
Twelve years?

147
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,204
Brother Ho and I took some goods
to Indonesia for the first time...

148
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,416
Their boss invited us
to dinner at a nightclub...

149
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,213
I said something wrong,
and offended their boss...

150
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:11,757
Suddenly there were two guns
pressed against my head...

151
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,593
They told me I had to finish
a whole bottle of whiskey...

152
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:20,224
I was so scared I peed in
my pants... I really peed!

153
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,769
Brother Ho here saved me...

154
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,980
He drank all that whiskey for me...

155
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,650
But to not drink was even worse...

156
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,111
Suddenly there were four guns
against my head!

157
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,367
Do you know what they
asked me to drink then?

158
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,869
Piss!

159
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,542
That night in the club I drank piss!

160
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,766
Learning? That's what's called learning!

161
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,113
That was our first job together...

162
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,116
It's all in the past...
don't bring it up again...

163
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,784
I will...

164
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,211
I had never cried before...

165
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,092
But that night I bawled...

166
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,764
After that I swore, no one would ever
put a gun to my head again!

167
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,291
Strong, eh?

168
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,051
Whoa, careful!

169
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,514
You need to hit the sandbag more!

170
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,309
I'm leaving tomorrow...

171
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,149
Time for you to disappear again...

172
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,901
I'll be back soon...

173
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,904
While I am away...

174
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,656
Take care of Dad...

175
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,658
Don't worry about it...

176
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,037
Look after yourself...

177
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,247
I will...

178
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,089
They're coming, get ready!

179
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:44,303
Be careful... I've got a bad feeling...

180
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:48,515
- How do you know?
- Intuition...

181
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,190
Mr. Sung, you've made it! How are you?

182
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,191
Where's Wang?

183
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,901
He fell ill. I'm his nephew and
he asked to come in his place...

184
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,070
How you doing... Hi, hi...

185
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,989
What kind of illness he has got?

186
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,325
Mr. Sung, let's go inside to talk...

187
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,162
Actually he's not ill, he's just lying
low for now, 'til things here clear up...

188
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,873
- You guys have travelled all this way!
- Have some tea!

189
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,791
Mr. Sung, this way please!

190
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,253
As the boss gets older,
he gets more afraid of everything...

191
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,462
Please, sit...

192
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:20,839
We shouldn't waste time!

193
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,302
Calling headquarters, please run a check
on license number 1086379...

194
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:28,305
We feel it warrants suspicion...

195
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:36,563
Mr. Sung, you are really reliable!

196
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:40,109
Even when I was still hustling in
Hsimenting, I always looked up to you...

197
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,152
Now would you believe it?

198
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:44,363
Someone has offered to pay
me double to whack you...

199
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,033
They must be crazy to think
I'm that kind of person!

200
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,326
Let me get you your money...

201
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,431
The police are here!

202
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,366
Hello?

203
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:18,457
Uncle?

204
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:39,311
"The ferry boat has departed...

205
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:46,152
Thousands of miles now separate us..."

206
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:52,158
Sung has killed many of
my brothers in Taiwan...

207
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,326
Now he is wanted by the police...

208
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,870
My boss is worried that
he might rat us out...

209
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,290
He requests that you, sir, come with us...

210
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,917
I don't want to be rude, but...

211
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,007
You son of a bitch! If you hurt my son...

212
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,842
I'll never let you off!

213
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,303
Run! Get out of here!

214
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,514
What are you doing to him? No, no!

215
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,019
Don't try it!

216
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:27,193
Hello? Wrong number...

217
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:35,284
Run, Uncle!

218
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,622
Uncle!

219
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,875
Jackie, what's going on in there?

220
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,427
Kit! Be careful!

221
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,514
Dad, don't come out here!

222
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,841
Dad! Dad, don't!

223
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:37,030
Dad! Dad!

224
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,081
Kit... you have to...
forgive... your brother!

225
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,195
Who sold me out?

226
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,326
You?

227
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:27,123
Brother Ho, if I sold you out,
would I be here with you now?

228
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,214
I don't know if we can
get away this time...

229
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,568
Brother Ho, what are you
doing? Brother Ho...

230
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,404
- I'm going to surrender.
- You can't! Brother Ho!

231
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:02,491
Don't do it! What ever you do, not that!

232
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:08,247
No, Brother Ho! Don't go! Brother Ho...

233
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,081
Run!

234
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:16,338
- Brother Ho...
- Get out of here!

235
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,923
I don't want to involve a friend...

236
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,301
There's gun shots in the cavern!

237
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,219
- Go on!
- No...

238
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:24,638
I'm telling you, go!

239
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,565
Halt! Don't move!

240
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:39,653
Put down the gun! You hear me? Drop it!

241
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,653
<i>Taiwan and Hong Kong Counterfeit
Smuggling Gangs in Shootout</i>

242
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,614
<i>Hong Kong Gang Leader Sung Tse-ho
Surrenders to Police</i>

243
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:38,212
The code of the <i>jianghu</i> world
doesn't exist anymore...

244
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:41,465
There's no one left that you can trust...

245
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,050
That piece of trash Wang
is my own nephew...

246
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,136
And he still sold us out...

247
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,681
He joined up with a new Hong Kong gang...

248
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,017
They are planning to take
over my operations...

249
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:56,272
As a result, we've lost Ho to them...

250
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,110
According to the code, we have
absolute respect for a loyal man...

251
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,030
And absolute contempt for betrayal...

252
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:09,117
Hello?

253
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:11,203
OK...

254
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:17,000
He will be in Fung Lim
Restaurant tonight...

255
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,630
What do you think?

256
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,715
Is there anything else I can help with?

257
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,134
Do you want to take some of my men?

258
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,600
Take care...

259
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,436
Thanks...

260
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:18,390
- Chief!
- What do we have?

261
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,892
Chief! This way...

262
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:30,837
Hmph! I'm not scared...

263
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:33,674
My boss will get his lawyer
to come and post bail for me!

264
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:36,051
If you're such a hero,
fight me without your gun!

265
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,970
Then we'll see who's stronger...

266
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,891
5703!

267
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,687
- Everything OK, sir?
- Fine...

268
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,113
Sung, what's the charge?

269
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,325
Drug trafficking and attacking the police!

270
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,828
- You've got some balls to attack Sung!
- Take down his confession...

271
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,039
Thank you...

272
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,475
How you doing? Doesn't the air
on the outside feel different?

273
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:25,684
Let me give you a lift...

274
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,354
Thanks, but we're not
going the same way...

275
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:30,647
I admire you...

276
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:34,443
For your friends, you kept
your mouth shut for three years...

277
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,487
The funny thing is, all the time
you were on the inside...

278
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:39,698
The counterfeiting racket
just got stronger...

279
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,992
Thanks...

280
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,330
I haven't asked about the
<i>jianghu</i> world for a long time...

281
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,878
Tell your friend...

282
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,005
That case from three years ago
hasn't been resolved yet...

283
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:57,215
I won't let him off...

284
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,552
Even a criminal for a single day...

285
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,054
Finds it hard to live the
straight life again...

286
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,476
Goodbye...

287
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,020
I won't be back here again...

288
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,359
Stop the car!

289
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,475
Kit, cool down...

290
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,859
Stop fighting!

291
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,496
Kit, stop hitting him!

292
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,083
Don't let me see you again!

293
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:53,517
Manager!

294
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,648
There's no manager here...

295
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:02,358
I'm Uncle Kin, are you looking for me?

296
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:06,905
Uncle Chung in Taiwan asked
me to come see you...

297
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,073
When I was in Taiwan doing business...

298
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,618
Sitting in jail, you mean!
What's this about business?

299
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:17,374
Uncle Chung asked me
to give you this letter...

300
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:22,212
That Chung is really shameless!

301
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:25,173
It's a wonder we are still friends...

302
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:28,677
It's difficult for an
ex-con to get a job...

303
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,597
Who wants to hire a jailbird?

304
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:37,561
Don't act so glum...

305
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:41,690
All of the brothers here have
done time in prison!

306
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,903
Some people like to adopt orphans...

307
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:49,823
I like to take in jailbirds!

308
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:54,244
Because I, too, have done time in prison...

309
00:35:57,664 --> 00:36:01,167
Everybody, this new brother
is reporting for duty...

310
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,669
Everyone should look after him...

311
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,755
He is... You are...?

312
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,339
Sung Tse-Ho...

313
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:08,008
Brother Ho!

314
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,470
No need for all that, just call me Ho...

315
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,181
What is this, a social gathering?

316
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,183
Isn't there work to be done?

317
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,436
I'm not paying you for doing nothing...

318
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,981
- Do you have a driver's license?
- No...

319
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,442
Whether you pass the exam or not...

320
00:36:25,442 --> 00:36:27,653
You are welcome to stay here...

321
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,154
Uncle Kin, you are too kind...

322
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,364
No need to say anymore...

323
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:33,492
There's no boss here...

324
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:46,690
- Take it for lunch...
- Thank you!

325
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:36,281
Mark!

326
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:50,546
This isn't what you told me
in the letter you wrote!

327
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:23,829
Mark... even if I break both of my legs...

328
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:26,164
I can never pay you back!

329
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:32,629
You idiot... it was my own bad luck
nothing to do with you...

330
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,512
I'm so glad to see you again!

331
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,264
It's been such a long time...

332
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,350
You're still just as handsome...

333
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:53,108
Mark... this isn't our world anymore...

334
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,443
What are you still doing here?

335
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:07,163
I've waited for you for three years...

336
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,541
Three years!

337
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:15,506
Let's start all over again...

338
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:36,485
Don't bother with me...

339
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:40,196
Look after your little brother...

340
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:46,537
Everyday he's been tailing Shing. It's
getting more and more dangerous...

341
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,126
You are both my brothers...

342
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:02,511
Kit, the whole department knows
how capable you are...

343
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:04,470
I recommended your promotion...

344
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,848
But the upper levels wouldn't approve it...

345
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,850
Why?

346
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:18,944
You should be very
familiar with this guy...

347
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:24,741
Three years ago he disappeared...

348
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:27,327
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan...

349
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,287
And he's back at it with
his old partners...

350
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,081
What does that have to do with me?

351
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:34,209
Right now we're investigating
underworld contacts in the police force!

352
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:38,213
The worst would be that a policeman's
blood relation turned out to be a gangster!

353
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,674
Understand?

354
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,304
When I carry out my duty as a cop...

355
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,057
I never even consider
that I have a brother...

356
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:51,852
Kit!

357
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:54,938
I'm taking you off Boss Shing's case...

358
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:57,190
I'm afraid you will spoil
the whole thing...

359
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,323
Officer Sung, tonight Boss Shing
will meet up with those Thais...

360
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,283
Nam!

361
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,503
All my brothers, drain your glasses!

362
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,756
- Brother Mark, let us hear about some of your heroic feats!
- Brother Ho should tell them!

363
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:24,342
My boss says the highest we
will go is 18 million, no more...

364
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:27,428
- OK, OK...
- Boss, Sung Tse-Ho is outside...

365
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,350
Draught beer, please...

366
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:41,693
Boss, he's over there...

367
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:50,577
Brother Ho! How come you didn't let
me know that you're back?

368
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:52,788
Not too friendly of you...

369
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:59,711
I thought we were once all
good brothers, right, Brother Mark?

370
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,677
Brother Ho, without you
looking after me then...

371
00:43:06,677 --> 00:43:08,762
I would never have what I have now!

372
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:11,264
Don't be ridiculous...

373
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,934
Your greatness today is
due to your own hard work...

374
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:15,310
I don't have any ability myself...

375
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,353
It was Mark who gave me the chance!

376
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:20,273
Mark, if you need any
help from me in the future...

377
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:21,482
Just say the word...

378
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,985
Don't talk shit... Let's drink...

379
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:26,697
You can really take care of your brothers!

380
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,658
- Raise your glass, cheers!
- Cheers!

381
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:36,957
This glass... is for my leg to drink...

382
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,877
Happy!

383
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,097
Brother Ho, come see me
when you have time...

384
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,389
We have a lot of things to discuss...

385
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:55,225
I'm not interested...

386
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:57,603
You will be...

387
00:43:57,603 --> 00:43:59,771
Well, I'll be going...

388
00:44:07,362 --> 00:44:09,072
Sung Tse-Ho!

389
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,784
Come with me...

390
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:26,882
- What are you doing?
- Don't move!

391
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:30,886
What did Boss Shing talk to you about?

392
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:32,220
Bullshit!

393
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:33,972
Don't try and fool me!

394
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:36,224
Which was it, business or bullshit?

395
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:37,558
Really, it was just bullshit...

396
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:39,019
Are the goods coming in
the day after tomorrow?

397
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:42,563
- I don't know...
- Where and when is the drop off?

398
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,315
I don't know...

399
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:48,111
How can you know nothing
and call yourself a "big brother"?

400
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,364
Kit!

401
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,993
Don't call me Kit ever again!
Address me as sir!

402
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,128
Sir...

403
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:09,758
I haven't been a "big brother"
for a long time...

404
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,184
Where do you work?

405
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:22,062
United Taxi Company...

406
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:25,315
Is that a decent business?

407
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:30,195
Driving a taxi to pull jobs?

408
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:33,865
Where do you live?

409
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:36,284
United Taxi Company...

410
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:40,163
So somebody was still
willing to take in a thief...

411
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:44,042
You brat! Why call him a thief
when you know his name?

412
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,168
Don't think that having a gun
makes you so great!

413
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:48,171
If you don't mind your business,
I'll shoot you down, you cripple...

414
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:54,845
Listen boy, don't point
your gun at my head...

415
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:57,138
If you've got the guts...

416
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:59,933
Then go ahead and shoot... Shoot!

417
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,893
Kit!

418
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:05,563
Sir, I know I owe you so much...

419
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,983
Give me a chance!

420
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:09,567
Give you a chance?

421
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,362
I beg of you to give me a chance!

422
00:46:13,113 --> 00:46:14,615
Do you know that because of you...

423
00:46:14,615 --> 00:46:17,242
I lost my chance at a promotion!

424
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,745
Because you're a gangster!

425
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,417
Neither of you are to leave Hong Kong...

426
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:32,966
I'll be back to look for you!

427
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,603
Come, come, have a cup of tea...

428
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:29,439
Thanks, Uncle Kin!

429
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:31,607
I will deduct it from your salary...

430
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:33,109
Wow, you're so cheap!

431
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:34,319
Otherwise, how can I support my family?

432
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,780
Oh, you're right...

433
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:41,952
There's a girl over there
staring at you... she's pretty!

434
00:47:41,952 --> 00:47:43,787
Your girlfriend?

435
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:52,253
Please come in!

436
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:54,130
No...

437
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:57,592
I want to ask you for your help...

438
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,763
Can you leave Hong Kong for a while?

439
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,558
I don't want to see Kit have a breakdown...

440
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:07,894
He can't take this pressure...

441
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:10,271
...neither can I...

442
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,194
I think if you left for a while...
he can get a bit better...

443
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,154
I won't leave!

444
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:24,327
I want Kit to see...
I've turned over a new leaf...

445
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:28,123
Can you give me the chance
to prove it to him?

446
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:36,089
Don't you think I want go out
and have fun with him, too?

447
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:39,425
Ice-skating... riding bicycles...

448
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,220
I don't want to lose my little brother...

449
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,562
Brother Ho!

450
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:55,400
Don't stay here, get inside...

451
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,903
There's no use in staying out here...

452
00:48:57,903 --> 00:49:00,906
Brother Ho can handle
this himself, get inside!

453
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:05,869
What kind of men are they?

454
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,580
- They're not good, for sure...
- Brother Ho, the boss wants to see you...

455
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,957
I'm busy...

456
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:14,377
Give me a little face...
just have a word with the boss...

457
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:19,424
Hello?

458
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,928
Brother Ho, Mark is with us now...
Drop by to do some business...

459
00:49:22,928 --> 00:49:25,764
Sorry, I'm not interested...

460
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,515
You may not interested
in doing business...

461
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:28,558
What if I told you it has to
do with your little brother...

462
00:49:28,558 --> 00:49:31,770
Are you interested now?
I'm waiting for you...

463
00:49:32,395 --> 00:49:34,064
OK...

464
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,942
Uncle Kin, I have to go out for a while...

465
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:40,737
When you have principles,
there's nothing to be afraid of...

466
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,198
Stand your ground!

467
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,787
Brother Ho... this way please...

468
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:53,249
Once you have been involved
with these gangsters...

469
00:49:53,499 --> 00:49:56,002
It's so hard to start over again...

470
00:50:23,238 --> 00:50:25,782
- Ho!
- Brother Ho...

471
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:29,160
Ho, I'm so glad you're back!

472
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,121
How are you, Mr. Yiu?

473
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:33,498
Fine... thanks for asking...

474
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:36,042
Come, talk to Shing!

475
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:39,212
You mean I'm not here to talk with you?

476
00:50:39,963 --> 00:50:41,923
It's the same as talking to Shing...

477
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:46,302
I've become old, and he has
taken over some of the operation...

478
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,596
Brother Ho, have a seat...

479
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:52,225
We are making big money now...

480
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:55,103
I really hope to work with you again...

481
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:57,230
How can we work together?

482
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,774
You're still our "big brother"...

483
00:50:58,774 --> 00:51:00,984
Mark will handle the
counterfeit money trafficking...

484
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:03,194
And I'll manage the flow of drugs...

485
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,571
Together we can reap huge
profits for the company!

486
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:09,159
There are a lot of old clients we
can win back with you aboard again...

487
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,703
You haven't got to the point yet...

488
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:16,207
If your brother could become our
inside man on the police force...

489
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,459
Everything else would be settled!

490
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,255
What could be better than to have
someone working for us inside the police?

491
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,218
Come here... There's
something I want to tell you...

492
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,814
How about if I don't accept?

493
00:51:40,732 --> 00:51:44,110
Brother Ho, it's only out of respect for you
I've kept that dead weight Mark around!

494
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,656
And your brother is acting recklessly,
trailing me clay in and day out...

495
00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:52,368
If I didn't care about respecting you,
he would have been dead long ago!

496
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,997
Shing...

497
00:51:56,998 --> 00:52:00,043
One is my friend...
the other is my brother...

498
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:03,713
What face would I have
left if I agreed to this?

499
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:06,507
Insulting me isn't a big deal...

500
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,885
But you absolutely cannot
insult my friends!

501
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:18,895
If you dare hurt a hair on my brother...

502
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:21,397
I guarantee your days will be numbered!

503
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:53,638
We've been searching for
this murderer Mark Lee...

504
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,306
...for more than three years now...

505
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:58,601
It's too bad there is no extradition
treaty between Hong Kong and Taiwan...

506
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:02,730
Otherwise, we could take
down their entire operation...

507
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:05,078
The ROC police department
want to give information

508
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,850
through Interpol to
the Hong Kong police.

509
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,225
The US police department
has also taken action.

510
00:53:09,377 --> 00:53:09,950
I see.

511
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,448
Recently we received some
very important information...

512
00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:16,494
In two days there will be a shipment
of counterfeit bills to Taiwan...

513
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,955
...along with five hundred kilos of heroin!

514
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:21,749
Though I can't break
the case this time...

515
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:25,879
I hope to see Mark and
his men brought to justice...

516
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,264
Boss, Sung Tse-Ho is too
shameless... Let's take him out!

517
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:39,935
It's no good to just kill him...
Why not have some fun with him?

518
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,737
Act according to the plan...

519
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:03,083
I've already paid you, so where
is the drop-off point?

520
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,794
I'll give you the address...

521
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,547
Be careful...

522
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,929
Let's go back inside...

523
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:22,894
You're back!

524
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:29,650
Did you have dinner yet?

525
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,992
What are you doing?

526
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:12,735
Mr. Mok, it's Kit... I've got something...

527
00:55:12,735 --> 00:55:14,946
The Thais are preparing to make
the deal with Boss Shing tomorrow...

528
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:17,240
The time and location will be...

529
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,409
OK, turn over your clues
tomorrow when you come in...

530
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:21,452
- After that it is of no concern to you!
- Why?

531
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:25,248
This case is not your concern anymore!
I'm afraid you spoil the whole thing...

532
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:26,416
Just give me a chance, OK?

533
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,377
I've already explained to you, no one
person is a hero in our department...

534
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,254
And you continue to act like this...

535
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,158
Do you know that today is my birthday?

536
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:28,228
Can you look at me?

537
00:56:28,228 --> 00:56:29,562
I may as well be a flowerpot...

538
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:34,192
But you'd still rather look
at that instead of me!

539
00:56:35,443 --> 00:56:39,614
This is your home... not
the police station!

540
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,626
Jackie...

541
00:56:57,173 --> 00:56:58,884
Happy birthday...

542
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,889
I didn't forget...

543
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:19,570
You'd better blow out the candles
before they start a fire...

544
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,336
- What was your wish?
- You really want to know?

545
00:57:35,336 --> 00:57:36,587
Hmm, a mystery...

546
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:38,589
Promise you won't get angry...

547
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,383
So tell me...

548
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:45,555
I wished that you two brothers
could be reunited...

549
00:57:52,103 --> 00:57:54,230
You can't get mad...

550
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,941
It's nothing...

551
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:59,360
You can't get mad on my birthday...

552
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,489
I won't let you get angry,
or else I'll get angry, too...

553
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:05,450
Smile...

554
00:58:08,244 --> 00:58:10,121
I'll get it...

555
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:18,713
What is it?

556
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,134
I want to speak to Kit...

557
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:29,599
Who is it?

558
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,017
You're can't get angry...

559
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:33,979
You promised me, you won't get mad...

560
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:49,035
- Have a seat...
- OK...

561
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:51,787
- Is today your birthday?
- Yes...

562
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:52,914
Have some cake...

563
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,749
Why treat him so nicely?

564
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:57,543
Kit, don't be like that...

565
00:58:59,254 --> 00:59:03,174
Kit... I don't care how you treat me...

566
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:05,510
I came here to speak frankly with you...

567
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,595
Boss Shing is preparing to set you up...

568
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:09,639
Watch yourself...

569
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,224
Thanks for your concern...

570
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:13,684
Don't believe what you heard
from those hoodlums...

571
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:18,940
Clues that come that easily...
are usually fake...

572
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:21,817
You think I'm still the same Kit as before?

573
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:24,112
I only want to help you,
whether you believe me or not...

574
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:26,281
You want to help me or trick me?

575
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:32,703
Since you got out of prison...
you've done nothing but get in my way!

576
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:35,081
Can you believe me just this once?

577
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:36,832
Trust you?

578
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:38,376
I don't even have a father anymore...

579
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:40,003
Kit!

580
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:46,634
Jackie!

581
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:50,055
Brother Ho!

582
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:54,684
His feelings toward me
haven't changed at all...

583
00:59:54,684 --> 00:59:57,812
Don't give up... He will come around...

584
00:59:57,812 --> 01:00:00,023
Don't let anyone look down on you...

585
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,322
Why aren't you willing to forgive him?

586
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:08,698
Let him choose a new path...

587
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:11,534
He's responsible for Dad's death!

588
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:14,329
Why are you forcing me to forgive him?

589
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:22,462
He's the one who chose
the wrong path, not me...

590
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:34,140
I'm the cop... and he's the robber...

591
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:40,563
In terms of the law, we're
going in opposite directions...

592
01:01:23,064 --> 01:01:25,066
Police!

593
01:01:34,784 --> 01:01:36,202
What is it, Uncle Kin?

594
01:01:36,202 --> 01:01:39,247
Your brother has been hurt
and he's in surgery now...

595
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:42,458
He's at Princess Margaret Hospital,
get over there, quick!

596
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,085
OK!

597
01:01:49,757 --> 01:01:51,342
What happened to my brother?

598
01:01:51,342 --> 01:01:55,221
It appears Shing was trying
to set him up on purpose...

599
01:01:55,555 --> 01:01:56,681
Is he hurt?

600
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:59,100
Hey, you can't go in there...

601
01:02:38,848 --> 01:02:42,268
I tried to stop him from going
it alone, but he insisted...

602
01:02:42,268 --> 01:02:46,647
I hope you can cooperate with the police
and let's know your location

603
01:03:36,864 --> 01:03:41,202
It's easy to become a hero... Jump!

604
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:46,041
Circumstances have changed,
and if you don't want to cooperate...

605
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,543
Well, there is no other choice...

606
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:50,420
Don't even think about telling the cops...

607
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,089
You should know that deep
down, everyone is for sale...

608
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:28,416
Hey! What are you doing?

609
01:04:33,129 --> 01:04:36,091
From now on, Sung Tse-Ho
doesn't work here!

610
01:04:41,637 --> 01:04:43,848
Stop that!

611
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:57,403
Fight!

612
01:05:12,752 --> 01:05:14,170
Stop it!

613
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:18,299
We can talk this out!
Everyone stop fighting!

614
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:22,220
It's not worth it to go back to jail!

615
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:36,359
Stop fighting!

616
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:39,070
Let him go!

617
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,240
Brother Ho...

618
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:44,742
You idiot, get out of here!

619
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:48,538
Bastard! Don't go!

620
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:51,874
You bastards!

621
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:54,085
You fuckin' bastards!

622
01:05:56,296 --> 01:05:58,048
Uncle Kin, this is my fault!

623
01:05:58,048 --> 01:06:00,508
I didn't want you to be involved!

624
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:03,469
If you act like this
you've got no principle!

625
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:05,846
Their guilt is what makes them fight!

626
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:09,392
If you fight back you're right back
on the old path!

627
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:18,526
Why did you work so hard to
start again? What was all that for?

628
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:22,363
Uncle Kin! Brother Ho!

629
01:06:22,363 --> 01:06:24,532
Get over here and look at this!

630
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:26,451
Mark!

631
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:34,250
Stop talking and get the first aid box!

632
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,711
Hurry with the first aid!

633
01:06:41,257 --> 01:06:43,259
Uncle Kin, what do we do?

634
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,637
You guys get out of here!

635
01:07:07,783 --> 01:07:10,578
Police! Submit to our search!

636
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:16,501
Is that necessary, officer?
Can't you see I'm injured?

637
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,628
I'll send my statement to the station...

638
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:21,297
Smartass, get out of here!

639
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:47,365
I've never noticed how beautiful
Hong Kong is at night...

640
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,995
But such a beautiful thing...
disappears in an instant...

641
01:07:52,995 --> 01:07:55,039
It's really worthless...

642
01:08:01,462 --> 01:08:03,214
Brother Ho...

643
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:05,216
Let's start all over...

644
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:06,759
Let's finish this last job...

645
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:09,304
And leave beautiful Hong Kong...

646
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:13,141
- Mark...
- We were never scared of death before...

647
01:08:13,141 --> 01:08:14,809
Why are we so scared of Shing now?

648
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:19,063
Don't push me...
I'll never again go down that road...

649
01:08:23,526 --> 01:08:26,487
What happened before...
it is all in the past...

650
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:30,366
It not the past yet! I'm not dead yet!

651
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:33,453
Say I let you do ten
more jobs, a hundred...

652
01:08:33,453 --> 01:08:37,165
Then what? Say I let you
kill Shing, then what?

653
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:45,423
I've already lost my brother...

654
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:48,218
I don't want to lose my friend, too...

655
01:08:48,218 --> 01:08:50,220
Mark, snap out of it, OK?

656
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,762
Don't say any more!

657
01:08:51,762 --> 01:08:53,848
I don't want your sympathy!

658
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:58,186
You didn't owe me anything!

659
01:08:58,186 --> 01:09:01,189
I never make my friends do
something they don't want...

660
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:03,191
I have my principles...

661
01:09:03,191 --> 01:09:06,026
I've never bowed before anyone!

662
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:09,405
You think I like begging?

663
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,369
I've had bad luck for three years,
just waiting for this one chance!

664
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:16,996
I only want to prove myself, not to
prove I'm more powerful than others!

665
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:20,583
I want everyone to know, those things I
have lost I will most definitely get back!

666
01:09:29,842 --> 01:09:33,554
What do you see in yourself?
Look at yourself and tell me what you see!

667
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:36,349
We were punished when
we were bad people...

668
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:40,395
But when we become good people...
they still follow us around!

669
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:42,772
Did you fight for your chance?

670
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:45,150
You didn't!

671
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,110
You never did!

672
01:09:50,863 --> 01:09:52,865
I don't want to be like you...

673
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:58,037
Mark!

674
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:29,402
What happened to you?

675
01:10:29,402 --> 01:10:31,612
I need to take something back...

676
01:10:47,837 --> 01:10:49,380
Stay where you are!

677
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,756
Go get me the tape...

678
01:10:50,756 --> 01:10:53,843
You haven't thought this through...
You'll be in deep trouble!

679
01:10:54,135 --> 01:10:56,471
Don't think about it!

680
01:11:02,435 --> 01:11:04,312
Shut it down!

681
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:17,825
- You better get out of here!
- Open the door!

682
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:20,745
Thanks, Uncle Chan!

683
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:22,955
Go after him!

684
01:13:11,564 --> 01:13:13,316
This all your fault, you idiot!

685
01:13:13,316 --> 01:13:15,651
I told you long ago, don't play with fire!

686
01:13:15,651 --> 01:13:17,237
Idiot...

687
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:21,449
If Ho hands that tape to the police,
not only will you fall to your death...

688
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:23,368
...the whole organization will collapse!
Idiot...

689
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:25,870
Are you finished?
Calling me idiot left and right...

690
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:28,289
What did you call me when
I made you money?

691
01:13:28,289 --> 01:13:30,124
I regret ever using you!

692
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:33,127
If you don't get back that plate,
I'll kill you myself!

693
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:34,504
So kill me then...

694
01:13:34,504 --> 01:13:36,672
Three years ago I sold Sung Tse-Ho out...

695
01:13:36,672 --> 01:13:39,217
Why should I be scared of him now?

696
01:13:42,512 --> 01:13:44,222
You have to pay for that!

697
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:48,017
You and I together will sit here
together and figure it out...

698
01:13:54,023 --> 01:13:55,650
Hello?

699
01:13:56,526 --> 01:13:59,529
Hey, Ho! Why would you
act so cruelly to me?

700
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:01,739
Mr. Yiu, I want to speak to Shing...

701
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:05,075
Shing? Wait a moment...

702
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:10,080
Without a doubt, you've got to ask
him to give back the tape...

703
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:14,210
Brother Ho, don't try to fool me...

704
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:15,795
We can work this out...

705
01:14:15,795 --> 01:14:17,547
Ten o'clock tonight

706
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:20,174
Bring two million US dollars to
the temple in exchange for the tape...

707
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:22,843
...and have a boat ready for me
at West Sandy Bay...

708
01:14:22,843 --> 01:14:24,053
Is it that simple?

709
01:14:24,053 --> 01:14:25,888
I want cash...

710
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:27,139
Bring it yourself!

711
01:14:27,139 --> 01:14:28,891
I'll be there...

712
01:14:36,816 --> 01:14:39,360
What did Ho say, idiot?

713
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,029
Well, what did he say?

714
01:14:43,614 --> 01:14:44,782
Well?

715
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:46,326
He said he wants to have
dinner with you tonight...

716
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:49,036
OK, I'll wait for him...

717
01:14:55,668 --> 01:14:57,462
Come in...

718
01:14:57,462 --> 01:14:58,838
Mr. Mok, I have new information...

719
01:14:58,838 --> 01:15:00,965
Sung Tse-Ho and Mark the cripple
got into a fight with Boss Shing...

720
01:15:00,965 --> 01:15:04,844
They are extorting money from Shing,
and the deal is going down tonight!

721
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,347
Do you know the time and place?

722
01:15:07,347 --> 01:15:09,640
We'll have it later...

723
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,893
Hello? This is...

724
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:15,896
Thanks...

725
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:20,610
Two minutes ago Boss Shing
withdrew two million US dollars...

726
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:23,070
Put the entire department
on notice to receive orders!

727
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,614
Yes, sir!

728
01:15:24,614 --> 01:15:27,074
Mr. Mok, let me take part
in the operation...

729
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:30,035
The doctors haven't released you yet,
what are you doing out of the hospital?

730
01:15:31,579 --> 01:15:34,123
I'm fine... its just a flesh wound...

731
01:15:34,123 --> 01:15:36,542
You're off duty for several days...
Now go home and rest!

732
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:40,170
Look, I can lift this chair no problem!

733
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:42,382
You're not a part of this operation!

734
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,676
My brother is the robber, not me!

735
01:15:46,386 --> 01:15:48,596
I've always done things according
to code, why are you punishing me?

736
01:15:48,596 --> 01:15:50,390
If you still remember the code,
then you know why!

737
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,224
Since my dad died three years ago,
I've trailed Shing all the time!

738
01:15:52,224 --> 01:15:54,810
- You and Ho are brothers!
- I know this case better than anyone!

739
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:58,814
- Why are you still punishing me?
- Will you lock him up?

740
01:15:59,357 --> 01:16:02,735
I'll lock him up myself! I will...

741
01:16:04,445 --> 01:16:07,114
I'll lock him up for certain...

742
01:16:09,867 --> 01:16:13,371
Kit, get real...

743
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:22,255
<i>Who would neglect their own home?</i>

744
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:25,675
<i>Or throw away their memories of youth? I</i>

745
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:29,512
<i>Who could bear to look
at the despair of yesterday?</i>

746
01:16:29,512 --> 01:16:32,848
<i>And take away our smiles?</i>

747
01:16:32,848 --> 01:16:36,226
<i>Youth does not understand
the cruel world</i>

748
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:39,314
<i>Ruddy cheeks are soon tainted with dust</i>

749
01:16:39,314 --> 01:16:47,863
<i>Tears long forgotten
will dampen your face</i>

750
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:51,701
<i>So sing your enthusiasm,
and reach out your hands</i>

751
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:55,204
<i>Let me embrace your dreams</i>

752
01:16:55,204 --> 01:17:01,085
<i>Let me see your true face</i>

753
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:06,090
Jackie...

754
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:14,181
I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight...

755
01:17:14,724 --> 01:17:16,851
You're giving up just like that?

756
01:17:17,477 --> 01:17:21,689
Can you give this package to Kit
before nine o'clock tonight?

757
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:24,442
The contents are very valuable to him...

758
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:30,114
Will you come back?

759
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:36,078
<i>The rising sun awakens the morning</i>

760
01:17:36,078 --> 01:17:39,039
<i>The luster of the land is revived</i>

761
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,377
<i>Let the breeze carry the sound</i>

762
01:17:42,377 --> 01:17:46,297
<i>Set your life to the music</i>

763
01:17:48,549 --> 01:17:50,885
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight...

764
01:17:50,885 --> 01:17:53,429
He asked me to give this
valuable package to you...

765
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:56,641
Kit, the tape I am giving you now...

766
01:17:56,641 --> 01:17:59,394
...is the proof to charge
Shing for counterfeiting...

767
01:17:59,394 --> 01:18:02,313
We've arranged to make a deal
tonight at West Sandy Bay...

768
01:18:02,313 --> 01:18:05,107
You can put me in prison if you'd like...

769
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:08,027
Anyway, I've decided not
to stay in Hong Kong...

770
01:18:09,153 --> 01:18:11,406
Kit, what are you doing?

771
01:18:11,406 --> 01:18:12,532
I have to arrest him!

772
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:15,285
- No! You can't arrest him!
- Let go!

773
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:17,370
Let go!

774
01:18:17,995 --> 01:18:22,792
Kit! Kit!

775
01:18:32,552 --> 01:18:35,888
Where's Ho? The food is already cold...

776
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:42,186
You know what to say, right?

777
01:19:08,796 --> 01:19:10,923
Do you believe in God?

778
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:15,219
Yes... I'm God...

779
01:19:16,804 --> 01:19:18,889
God is a man...

780
01:19:20,308 --> 01:19:23,353
Anyone who can control
his own destiny is God!

781
01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:28,691
But there are times and
situations that one can't control...

782
01:19:31,486 --> 01:19:33,654
You'll either win or lose...

783
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:45,082
Hold it!

784
01:19:47,377 --> 01:19:49,128
Where's the money?

785
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:53,048
Where's the tape?

786
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:55,134
I gave it to the police...

787
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,808
Not so fast...

788
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,727
There's a bomb inside!

789
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:07,271
You shouldn't fuck with me...

790
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:13,486
You scared now?

791
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:16,071
Then how can we go on with the game?

792
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,107
Motherfucker!

793
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:54,985
Motherfucker!

794
01:20:54,985 --> 01:20:57,655
After Sung Tse-Ho arrived,
he and Master began to argue...

795
01:20:57,655 --> 01:20:59,615
He told Master to give him
two million US dollars...

796
01:20:59,615 --> 01:21:01,283
He said he'll be setting out to sea
from West Sandy Bay tonight...

797
01:21:01,283 --> 01:21:03,202
Then I heard gunshots...

798
01:21:03,202 --> 01:21:05,413
That's him!

799
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:07,832
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

800
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:11,335
- Are you willing to be a witness?
- Yes!

801
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:49,206
I knew that a jerk like you
would try to set me up!

802
01:21:49,206 --> 01:21:50,332
You will lose...

803
01:21:50,332 --> 01:21:52,084
Get out!

804
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:54,294
Get out! Get out!

805
01:21:56,296 --> 01:21:58,674
If you guys are smart, you'll let him go!

806
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:03,596
Come on! Over here!

807
01:22:03,929 --> 01:22:05,556
Go!

808
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,620
Brother Ho, get in the boat!

809
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:29,371
You go ahead...

810
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:33,418
Didn't you say we would go together?

811
01:22:34,669 --> 01:22:37,004
There's still something I have to do...

812
01:22:40,425 --> 01:22:42,593
I'll meet you again...

813
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:48,098
Mark, start the boat!

814
01:22:52,603 --> 01:22:54,480
I'll be waiting for you...

815
01:23:41,235 --> 01:23:42,903
Walk!

816
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,841
Let him go, or we'll kill your brother!

817
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:06,093
Don't move!

818
01:24:07,553 --> 01:24:09,680
Trade one for one...

819
01:24:16,395 --> 01:24:18,105
Go!

820
01:24:19,023 --> 01:24:21,484
Go! Walk!

821
01:24:39,418 --> 01:24:41,253
I won't let you off...

822
01:24:42,505 --> 01:24:44,298
I know...

823
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:58,270
Kit!

824
01:27:07,274 --> 01:27:09,359
Come over here!

825
01:28:54,298 --> 01:28:56,258
Come over here!

826
01:28:57,885 --> 01:29:01,556
This is your older brother!
Look into his eyes!

827
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,518
Take a good look!

828
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:13,150
No matter mistakes he made in the
past, he has paid it all back to you!

829
01:29:17,863 --> 01:29:20,157
He's brave enough to change...

830
01:29:20,157 --> 01:29:22,034
What can't you be brave
enough to forgive him?

831
01:29:22,034 --> 01:29:23,911
Why?

832
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:30,793
Be a brother...

833
01:30:17,548 --> 01:30:19,759
Shing!

834
01:30:49,664 --> 01:30:52,166
Miss, you can't go over there!

835
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:55,294
Shing!

836
01:31:00,675 --> 01:31:03,719
Sung Tse-Ho, the police
have you surrounded!

837
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:08,182
You have three minutes to put
down your weapons and come out!

838
01:31:20,945 --> 01:31:23,072
No more bullets?

839
01:31:24,281 --> 01:31:26,200
I'm going to give myself up...

840
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,660
I won't have any problems...

841
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,829
But you will...

842
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:32,456
I have money...

843
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:35,585
In three days, I'll walk out of
the courtroom a free man...

844
01:31:35,585 --> 01:31:39,213
With money, you can change
black into white!

845
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:42,341
These things... I have learned from you...

846
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:44,176
Too bad about your brother...

847
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:47,179
Because of you he's changed
from white to black...

848
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:49,306
You've condemned him to death!

849
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:00,294
Kit...

850
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:02,838
You haven't done anything wrong...

851
01:33:02,838 --> 01:33:04,924
Our paths go in different directions...

852
01:33:05,382 --> 01:33:08,385
Your path... is the right one...

853
01:33:15,225 --> 01:33:17,394
I took the the wrong one before...

854
01:33:18,603 --> 01:33:20,105
But now I've returned to the right one...

855
01:33:20,105 --> 01:33:23,108
I only hope its not too late!

856
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,157
<i>The sound of light laughter</i>

857
01:33:28,157 --> 01:33:31,280
<i>Gives me a warm feeling</i>

858
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:37,830
<i>You send a strong current
of happiness into me</i>

859
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:40,606
<i>The sound of soft whispers</i>

860
01:33:40,606 --> 01:33:43,729
<i>As we reach the end of a long road</i>

861
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:49,108
<i>We finally step into the
beautiful sunshine!</i>

862
01:33:49,108 --> 01:33:51,494
<i>Thunderous cheers erupt</i>

863
01:33:51,494 --> 01:33:56,135
<i>Like the setting sun
radiating golden arrows</i>

864
01:33:56,135 --> 01:34:02,816
<i>The smile from my days
with you has reappeared!</i>

865
01:34:02,816 --> 01:34:05,505
<i>The sound of light calling</i>

866
01:34:05,505 --> 01:34:08,672
<i>Together we raise our heads
to look at the sky</i>

867
01:34:08,672 --> 01:34:15,309
<i>At last the brilliant blue sky
has appeared for you!</i>

868
01:34:15,309 --> 01:34:18,041
<i>Holding you</i>

869
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:21,598
<i>The soft warmth of those earlier
times comes surging back</i>

870
01:34:21,598 --> 01:34:24,288
<i>In my heart</i>

871
01:34:24,288 --> 01:34:27,844
<i>The innocent dreams of my
youth have not been ruined</i>

872
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:30,577
<i>Today, I am</i>

873
01:34:30,577 --> 01:34:34,048
<i>Standing shoulder to shoulder
with you once more</i>

874
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:37,474
<i>The feelings of the past</i>

875
01:34:37,474 --> 01:34:42,289
<i>At this moment have new freshness</i>

876
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:49,274
<i>Once I see you</i>

877
01:34:49,274 --> 01:34:52,787
<i>The sweetness in your eyes strikes me</i>

01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:55,476
<i>My heart</i>

879
01:34:55,476 --> 01:34:59,076
<i>Remains completely unchanged</i>

880
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:01,766
<i>Today, I am</i>

881
01:35:01,766 --> 01:35:05,280
<i>Standing shoulder to shoulder
with you once more</i>

882
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,184
<i>The feelings of the past</i>
