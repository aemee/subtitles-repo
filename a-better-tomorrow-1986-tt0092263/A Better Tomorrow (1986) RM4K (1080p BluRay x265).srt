1
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Kit!

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,100
Kit!

3
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
- Two dollars.
- Okay.

4
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,800
- Mark.
- Coming.

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Hey, the plate!

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,400
Sir.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,900
Tastes good?

8
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Are you alright?

9
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
- Here, go see a doctor.
- Thanks, Mark.

10
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,900
Can you read that?

11
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
What?

12
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
It's all in English.

13
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,507
Hi Tom, how are you?

14
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:16,507
Hi, Russ.

15
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,899
Hi!

16
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,215
- Tom, good to see you
- Long time no see

17
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:22,415
Thanks

18
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,008
That's heavy.

19
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,382
That's great. First class!

20
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:35,968
Here.

21
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,881
Hey! Why don't we go out
for a drink sometime, all right?

22
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:57,255
Why don't you find us some women?
We can all go out.

23
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,291
Tom, it was a pleasure doing
business with you.

24
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,400
You're good at bullshitting.
Your English has improved.

25
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,200
- You can even say "Of course"!
- Of course!

26
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Good morning.

28
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,100
- Good morning, Mark.
- That's "Brother Mark".

29
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Mr. Yiu.

30
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Ho, you're back.

31
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,100
Everything okay?

32
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
- I already checked it.
- Great.

33
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,300
It's easy dealing with the foreigners.

34
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,300
They are not all trustworthy.

35
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,700
You trust people too easily.

36
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,700
Thanks.

37
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
You must be Sing?
Take a seat.

38
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,300
No, thanks.
I'll stand.

39
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
Good morning,
Linda.

40
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,900
Rose!

41
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,200
Sing, you can learn a lot from Ho.

42
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
He is the most loyal.

43
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Yes, he can teach me a lot.

44
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Mark is a bit frivolous,
but he is loyal too.

45
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,700
Yes, he takes good care of me.

46
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
What's that?

47
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Nothing, we're just talking about you.

48
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Really?

49
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Ho. Doesn't your brother, Kit,
graduate today?

50
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,900
Oh, yeah!

51
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,500
I forgot to get him a present.

52
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,900
I gotta go.

53
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,000
Ho, take Sing with you to Taiwan
day after tomorrow.

54
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,800
Give the youngster a change.
Show him the ropes.

55
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Taiwan! It's not Chaiwan.
Have you got the guts?

56
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,500
I've been at this for years,
and I'm still afraid. Know why?

57
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
The drills, choppers, Taiwan gangs!
Even the beer drinking can kill you!

58
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,400
- Don't make fun of him.
- Okay.

59
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
So, Kit graduated...
get him a woman for a gift!

60
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
No, I won't let him go astray like us.

61
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,200
Hey, it's better than getting a hooker.

62
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I want to see him get
his PhD...

63
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,200
...and see him get married.

64
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
See him consummate his marriage,
have a baby...

65
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,100
...then his life will be even harder!

66
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,500
They say, "One with a dirty mouth
steps on shit entering an elevator! "

67
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
You first.

68
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,000
I won't! Let's step in together!

69
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't move. Police!

70
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
- Search!
- Yes, sir.

71
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Don't move!

72
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
- Don't joke with me.
- Turn around.

73
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
We both have guns.

74
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,400
If you don't respect me,
I won't respect you.

75
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,800
Let's see who is not
respecting the other.

76
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
That tickles! Don't...

77
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Enough!

78
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Enough.

79
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Brother, I have some good news.

80
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,500
I've been accepted to become
a Police Inspector. Surprised?

81
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,700
It'll be hard work.

82
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
You'll be the Police Commissioner
one day.

83
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Jackie!

84
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,800
She's my girlfriend.
She helps take care of dad.

85
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,000
My big brother.

86
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Hi.

87
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Don't worry, dad's in good hands.

88
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,800
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

89
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,000
It's time for my audition!

90
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,100
A new girlfriend...
I hope this time it'll last.

91
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,800
That all depends on how she behaves.

92
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
You said you would go with me.

93
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
Hurry up!

94
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,100
I'd love to stay, but...

95
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
No need to explain,
get out of here!

96
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Excuse me.

97
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,300
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

98
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Bye.

99
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
- Ho...
- Dad.

100
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,200
You should get out of the business.

101
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Your brother has no idea
what you are doing.

102
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,700
I remember when you kids played
"Cops & Robbers" together.

103
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,800
Even when he lost...

104
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,600
...he still wanted to be the cop.

105
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,700
I don't want to see you two brothers
play this game for real.

106
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,600
Give it up for the sake of
your brother.

107
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,700
- Okay?
- Alright.

108
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
It's about time.

109
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,800
- Sorry, the traffic was horrible.
- A real traffic jam.

110
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm Jackie.

111
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
- Give me a chance, please!
- Give her a chance!

112
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
- Careful, she's pregnant!
- Are you alright?

113
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir, the traffic was awful!

114
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
- Please give her a chance?
- Okay.

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,900
Alright, go, go ahead!

116
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,600
Pregnant and getting
pushed like that...

117
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, panel judges.
Please listen.

118
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,900
Sorry.

119
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,600
It's all your fault! You embarrassed
me before I went on stage!

120
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,200
You can't help in any way!

121
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't even have confidence
in yourself. How can I help?

122
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,700
They didn't say you failed.
You don't know it's hopeless.

123
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,300
Give that back to me!

124
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Now it's really hopeless!

125
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,900
Have you decided?

126
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,300
One last job, then I'll quit.

127
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
Because of Kit?

128
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
That deal in Taiwan tomorrow,
you better not go.

129
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,700
If anything happens to me there,
you can take care of things here.

130
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,600
You will lead the Brothers
in the future.

131
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,500
I cannot do that.

132
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,900
Let Godfather Sing do it.
He looks just like Al Pacino.

133
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,700
Mark, stop fooling around!

134
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Ho, we can't do it without you.
I still have much to learn from you.

135
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
You really think you can learn this?

136
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,700
Don't think reading gangster books
will help make you the boss.

137
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Have you ever had a gun
pointed at your head?

138
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
No.

139
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Twelve years ago...

140
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
Twelve years already.

141
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
For the first time, I went with Ho
to bring goods to Indonesia.

142
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,100
The Boss there treated us to
dinner in the night club.

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
I said something wrong,
displeasing the Boss...

144
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,200
...and there were two
guns pointing at my head.

145
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
I was forced to drink
a bottle of whiskey.

146
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,700
I was so scared, I pissed my pants!

147
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Fortunately, Ho drank the whole
bottle of whiskey for me.

148
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,100
But, it got even worse after that.
Four guns were pointed at my head.

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,300
You know what they made me drink?

150
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Piss!

151
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Drank piss in a night club!

152
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,100
You want to learn?
That's real learning!

153
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,300
That's how we got through
our first job.

154
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,900
That's all in the past,
forget about it.

155
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
No.

156
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,900
I had never cried before.

157
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,000
That was the first time I cried.

158
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,600
I swore I'd never let anyone
point a gun at my head again!

159
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,900
How's that?

160
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,700
Careful!

161
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,500
Practice more with your sand bag.

162
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

163
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
Disappearing as usual.

164
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
I'll be back soon.

165
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,900
While I'm away,
take good care of dad.

166
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Sure.

167
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Take care.

168
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I will.

169
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,300
They're coming, move!
Hurry!

170
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,200
Careful, something's wrong.

171
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,500
- How do you know?
- Intuition.

172
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,700
- Mr. Sung, how are you?
- Where is Mr. Wang?

173
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,500
Sick. I'm his nephew.
He asked me to meet with you.

174
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,700
How are you?

175
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
What's wrong with him?

176
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,500
Mr. Sung, let's go in first.

177
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,500
It's nothing serious. The police
are quite alert these days...

178
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,300
...and it's better for him to lay low.

179
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,400
- Have a cup of tea.
- Thanks.

180
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,400
Mr. Sung, this way please.

181
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,400
Come in, please, have a seat.

182
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,600
Let's not waste any more time.

183
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,800
Head quarters, please run a check
on a car numbered 1086379.

184
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,300
Mr. Sung, you really keep your word.
When I was a kid, I admired you.

185
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,600
Can you believe that someone is
paying me triple to kill you?

186
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,500
He's crazy, who does he think I am?

187
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Let me get your money.

188
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
The police are coming!

189
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Hello?

190
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,300
Uncle...

191
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Sung Tse Ho has killed some
of our Brothers in Taiwan.

192
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
Now, the police are after him...

193
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
...and our boss is afraid he'll talk.

194
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,600
You're coming with me.

195
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
I don't want to use force.

196
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,500
You bastard!

197
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,700
If you hurt my son, I'll hunt
you down till the day I die!

198
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,600
Run, quickly run!

199
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,600
What are you doing?
Don't! Don't!

200
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,900
No, don't!

201
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,700
Hello, hello?
Wrong number!

202
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
Uncle, let's go!

203
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,500
Uncle!

204
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,700
Jackie, what's happening?

205
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Kit, watch out!

206
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,300
Dad, don't come out!

207
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,800
Dad! Dad, don't!

208
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Dad!

209
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,300
Dad!

210
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,700
Kit, you have to... forgive...
your brother...

211
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Who betrayed me?

212
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
You?

213
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,500
Brother Ho, if I had betrayed you,
I wouldn't be here with you.

214
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,500
I don't know if I'll escape this time.

215
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000
Brother Ho, what are you doing?

216
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,400
- Brother Ho...
- Surrendering.

217
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,300
You can't go, Ho! Don't go.
You shouldn't go out there.

218
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
Brother Ho, don't.
Don't go out there!

219
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
Go! Run!

220
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,300
- Brother Ho...
- Go!

221
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,600
I won't let you get caught.

222
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,500
Gun shots are coming from inside!

223
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,800
- Go!
- I don't want to!

224
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm telling you to go!

225
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,700
Stand up and don't move!
Don't move!

226
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,600
Put down the gun!

227
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,600
Put down the gun!

228
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Brotherhood and ethics do not seem
to exist in our world anymore.

229
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,500
No one is trustworthy anymore.

230
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,100
Little Wang really is my nephew...

231
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
...but he has betrayed me as well.

232
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,900
He hooked up with
a new force in Hong Kong...

233
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,200
...and is trying to take over
my business.

234
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,300
Sung Tse Ho went down
because of him.

235
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
On principle, we strictly
respect loyal friends.

236
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,000
And we won't forgive those
who betray us.

237
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Hello?

238
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,700
Yes.

239
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Tonight he will be at
Fung Lim Kok Restaurant.

240
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,000
Is there anything else
I could do to help?

241
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,800
Do you need some extra men?

242
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Take care.

243
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,300
Thanks.

244
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,100
Captain!

245
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,100
Captain, this way.

246
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,600
I'm not scared.

247
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,500
My boss will bail me out.

248
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
Come on, drop your gun
and let's fight as equals.

249
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Then we'll see who is stronger.

250
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
5703!

251
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,300
- Yes, sir, what is it?
- Nothing.

252
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,100
Mr. Sung, what's up?

253
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,900
Drug trafficking, resisting arrest,
assault.

254
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
- Not very smart.
- Take his statement.

255
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Thanks!

256
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,400
How's it going? It's a lot different
on the outside, isn't it?

257
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Need a lift?

258
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,700
No, thanks.
We're going different directions.

259
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
I admire you.

260
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,800
Your loyalty. Three years in jail
and you haven't said a word.

261
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What's crazy is while
you were inside...

262
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,000
...the counterfeit money was
still being printed.

263
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Thanks!

264
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,100
I've retired.

265
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Tell your friends...

266
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,300
...that case three years ago isn't
closed yet. I'm not giving up.

267
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,000
Once a thief, it's not easy
to turn your life around.

268
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Bye.

269
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,500
I won't be back.

270
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Stop!

271
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,100
Kit, calm down!

272
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Stop fighting!

273
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,100
Kit, stop it!

274
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
Don't let me see you again!

275
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,900
Are you the manager?

276
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
There's no manager here.

277
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm Ken. What do you want?

278
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,100
Ken, Uncle Chung from Taiwan
told me to come to you.

279
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,000
I was doing business in Taiwan...

280
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,600
You were in jail,
not doing business.

281
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,800
Uncle Chung asked me to
give you this letter in person.

282
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Uncle Chung never has
anything good for me.

283
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,000
But we are good old friends.

284
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,600
It's very difficult for an
ex-con to find a job.

285
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,800
Who wants to employ an ex-con?

286
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,700
No need to get depressed.

287
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,900
Everyone here has been a jailbird.

288
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,200
Some people like to adopt orphans...

289
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,800
...I like to take care of ex-convicts!

290
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,000
You see, I also have been
in prison before.

291
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
Colleagues...

292
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,300
...this brother has just been
released.
Take good care of him.

293
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,600
- He is... you are...
- Sung Tse Ho.

294
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
Brother Ho!

295
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,400
Oh no, just call me Ho.

296
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,646
What are you doing?
Trying to win favors?

297
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:57,942
Get back to work!

298
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm not paying you to stand around!

299
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,100
- You got a driver's license?
- No.

300
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't care if you get one or not.

301
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Just stick around here for now.

302
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
- Ken, you're very kind.
- Don't worry about it.

303
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,400
There is no boss here.

304
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:27,885
- For your lunch.
- Thank you.

305
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,800
Mark.

306
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Why did you lie to me in your letters?

307
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,800
Mark, even if both my 
legs were broken...

308
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,500
...I could never make it up to you.

309
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,800
Idiot, I just had some bad luck,
don't worry about it.

310
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,900
I'm so happy to see you again!

311
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,600
It's been so long!

312
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,600
You still look good.

313
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,200
Mark, this is not our world anymore.

314
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,500
Why are you still staying here?

315
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,500
I've waited for you for three years.
Three years, already!

316
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,500
We can start over again!

317
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,100
Don't worry about me.
Look after your brother.

318
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,800
He's been following Sing everyday.
It's getting dangerous.

319
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,500
Anyhow, you two are real brothers.

320
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,800
Kit, we all know you are very
capable.

321
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,800
In fact, I'd like you to be promoted,
but the higher-ups don't approve.

322
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Why?

323
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,200
This guy. You know him well.

324
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,100
We thought he had
disappeared for good.

325
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,800
But he was just released from jail
and is back in town.

326
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,300
- He's with his old brothers again.
- How does that affect me?

327
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,700
This is an investigation of 
corruption in the police force.

328
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,100
And we can't have officers
with relatives in the underworld.

329
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,600
Now do you understand?

330
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,400
When I'm on duty...

331
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,200
...I never think of him as my brother.

332
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Kit...

333
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,300
...you're off the Sing case.

334
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,300
I can't allow anything to ruin it.

335
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,400
Mr. Sung, Sing is meeting
the Thai men tonight.

336
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,600
Brothers, cheers!

337
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,300
- Mark, tell us some of your stories!
- Ho, you tell.

338
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,500
My Boss says the maximum price
is 18 million, no more.

339
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Okay, okay.

340
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,700
Sung Tse Ho's group is outside.

341
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
Draught beer, please.

342
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,100
Bye.

343
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,800
Our Boss is over there.

344
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,200
Ho!

345
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,800
You didn't let us know you're back!
What kind of a friend are you?

346
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,500
We were once good brothers.
Right, Mark?

347
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Ho, if you hadn't taken care of me,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

348
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,400
Don't be silly, you've worked hard.
I don't have that kind of power.

349
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,700
It's thanks to Mark, that the 
position opened up for me.

350
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,800
Mark, should you ever need my help,
feel free to call me.

351
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,400
No more bullshit,
come on, let's drink!

352
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,900
You really take good care
of your brothers!

353
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,700
Come on, cheers!

354
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,000
This glass is for my leg!

355
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,700
Happy?

356
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,800
Ho, call me when you have time.
We have lots to discuss.

357
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,100
I'm not interested.

358
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,200
You will be.

359
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,600
I have to go now.

360
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,900
Sung Tse Ho!

361
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,800
Step outside with me.

362
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,700
What are you doing?

363
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,800
What did Sing tell you?

364
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,600
Just bullshit.

365
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,500
Don't lie to me!

366
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,700
Is it business or bullshit?

367
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,900
Really bullshit!

368
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
- Are the goods arriving soon?
- I don't know.

369
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,700
Where is it unloading? And when?

370
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,400
I don't know.

371
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,300
You don't know anything!
How can you be the boss?

372
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,200
Kit...

373
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,000
Don't ever call me Kit again,
call me 'Sir'!

374
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,000
Sir...

375
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,800
...I haven't been the Boss
for a long time.

376
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,900
Where do you work?

377
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,100
United Taxi Company.

378
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,300
A regular job?

379
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,200
Robbing with a taxi?

380
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,200
- Where do you live?
- United Taxi Company.

381
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,300
Someone's willing to take 
in a thief like you!

382
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,500
You bastard! "Thief"?!
He has a name!

383
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,000
Just because you have a gun...

384
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,300
Touch me again and I'll kill you,
you cripple!

385
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,200
Kid, do not point a gun at my head.

386
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,200
If you've got the guts, kill me!

387
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,600
Shoot me... shoot me!

388
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Kit...

389
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,600
...No...
Sir, I know I owe you a lot.

390
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,100
Can you give me another chance?

391
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
Give you another chance?

392
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,300
I'm the one who needs
another chance!

393
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,000
Because of you, I've lost
any chance of promotion!

394
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,600
Because you're a gangster!

395
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
You'd better not leave Hong Kong.

396
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,000
I'll be watching you!

397
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,400
Break time!

398
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,700
Thank you, Ken!

399
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,500
Don't thank me, I'm taking it out
from your salary!

400
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,800
You're so mean!

401
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,700
Hey, I've got a wife to support.

402
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,391
There's a beautiful girl staring at you.
Your girlfriend?

403
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,100
- Please come in!
- No, thanks!

404
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,200
I need your help.

405
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Can you leave Hong Kong
for a while?

406
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,700
Kit is about to have
a mental breakdown.

407
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,800
He can't stand this pressure,
and neither can I .

408
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,600
I think it's best if you
go away for awhile.

409
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,400
I can't leave.

410
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,800
I need Kit to see that
I've started a new life.

411
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,600
Can you give me the
chance to show him?

412
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,000
Do you think that I don't want to...

413
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,900
...go skating and cycling
with him again?

414
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,100
I want my little brother back.

415
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Brother Ho!

416
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,000
Don't stay here, go inside.

417
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,700
You standing here won't help.

418
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,800
Ho will handle his own business,
go inside!

419
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,000
- Who are they?
- They're not good guys.

420
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,500
Our boss wants to
invite you to a meeting.

421
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm busy.

422
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,000
Show some respect,
have a little chat with the boss.

423
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,000
- Hello?
- Ho, Mark is here now.

424
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,900
Come join us and discuss business.

425
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,900
Sorry, I'm not interested.

426
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,400
Don't want to talk about business?
Let's talk about your brother then.

427
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,300
- Still not interested? I'm waiting.
- Okay.

428
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Ken, I have to go out for awhile.

429
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
If you live by your principles,
you have nothing to fear.

430
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,100
Be strong.

431
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,200
Ho, this way.

432
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,800
It's easy to become a gangster,
but it's hard to get out.

433
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,400
- Ho.
- Brother Ho!

434
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,100
Ho, I'm so glad you're back.

435
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,300
- Mr. Yiu, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

436
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Come on... come over
and talk with Sing.

437
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Not with you?

438
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,000
Talking with Sing is the same.
I'm old...

439
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,900
...he can make the decisions.

440
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,700
Sit down.

441
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,400
Business is good right now.

442
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,900
I was hoping you'd like to cooperate.

443
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,500
How's that?

444
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,100
You're still our Boss.

445
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,000
Mark will handle trafficking
the money.

446
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,100
I traffic drugs.

447
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Earn some money for the company.

448
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,000
There's too many old debts,
we need you to get our money back.

449
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,600
Get to the point.

450
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,300
We need an insider at the police
department. Maybe your brother.

451
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,400
There's nothing better than having
one of your own on the force.

452
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,100
Come here, I have
something to tell you.

453
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
What if I don't accept?

454
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,600
Ho, I respect you, so I'm keeping
that dead fish Mark here.

455
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,500
Your brother knows no limits,
he follows me everyday!

456
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,500
If I didn't respect you,
he'd be dead already!

457
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,100
Sing, one is my friend,
one is my brother.

458
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,500
If I can promise you this,
how can I walk out this door?

459
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,400
I don't care if you insult me,
but don't insult my friend!

460
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,600
If you dare hurt my brother...

461
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,100
...you will live to regret it!

462
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,600
Mark Lee is a serious killer.
We've been after him for three years.

463
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,100
But there's no extradition treaty
between Hong Kong and Taiwan.

464
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,200
However, we may be able
to arrest the whole syndicate.

465
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,209
The ROC Police Dept
wanna give information...

466
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,004
to Interpol and to the
Hong Kong Police.

467
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:50,006
The US Police Dept has also taken action

468
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,582
I see!

469
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,700
We just got some
important information.

470
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,800
In two days, there'll be a whole lot of
counterfeit money brought to Taiwan.

471
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,000
Along with 500 kg. Of morphine.

472
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,200
Even though I can't break
the case myself...

473
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,800
...I still hope to see Mark Lee
and his gang get arrested.

474
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,100
Boss, Sung Tse Ho is too much,
let us finish him off!

475
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,700
We don't need to kill him,
we can still play with him.

476
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,200
Just follow the plan.

477
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,600
We already paid. Where do
we pick up the merchandise?

478
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,000
Okay, I'll write it down.

479
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,000
That's the address.

480
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,800
Let's drink!

481
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,200
You're back!

482
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,400
Have you eaten?

483
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,400
What are you doing?

484
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,800
Mr. Mok, it's Kit.
I have some information.

485
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,100
The Thai are delivering
the goods tomorrow.

486
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,300
The location and time should be...

487
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,900
Kit, bring in the information
tomorrow, then leave it alone.

488
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,900
Why?

489
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,700
You are not on the case!
I can't allow it!

490
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
Just give me a chance.

491
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I've told you, the police force
won't allow it.

492
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,100
You do this now and...

493
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,300
Do you know that
today is my birthday?

494
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,500
Why won't you look at me?

495
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,400
You'll look at a vase, but not me!

496
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,000
This is your home,
not the Police Station!

497
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,300
You even forgot my birthday!

498
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,300
Jackie.

499
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
Happy Birthday.

500
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,500
I didn't forget.

501
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,000
Blow out your candles,
they're almost out.

502
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,800
- What did you wish for?
- You really want to know?

503
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,100
Sure.

504
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,600
- Promise you won't get mad?
- Just say it.

505
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,800
I just wished you two brothers
would reunite.

506
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,400
Don't be mad.

507
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,700
I'm not.

508
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,300
Don't be mad, it's my birthday.
I won't let you lose your temper.

509
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,600
Otherwise, I will get mad.

510
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,000
Smile!

511
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,000
I'll get the door.

512
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,400
What is it?

513
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,100
I need to speak to Kit.

514
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Who is it?

515
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,500
Don't get angry!

516
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,800
Keep your promise, okay?

517
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,000
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.

518
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,600
- Today is your birthday?
- Yes.

519
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,100
- Have some cake.
- Who told you to be nice to him?!

520
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,000
Kit, stop it.

521
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,300
Kit, I don't care how you treat me...

522
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,700
...I'm just here to warn you.

523
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,700
Sing is going to trap you at any
minute. Please, be careful.

524
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,500
Thanks for your concern.

525
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,900
Don't trust information
that comes too easily.

526
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,900
Usually, those clues are planted ones.

527
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,900
You have to be able to spot them.

528
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,200
Do you think I'm the same old Kit?

529
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,500
I just wanted to help.

530
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,100
- That's all.
- Help me or trick me?

531
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,500
Did you know your release
from jail ruined my career?

532
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,200
Can't you trust me just once?

533
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:18,043
Trust you?

534
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,844
It's because I trusted you
that my father is dead!

535
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,300
Jackie...

536
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,600
Ho.

537
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,400
His feelings about me
still haven't changed.

538
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,400
Don't give up.

539
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,100
Please, keep trying.
Don't let others look down on you.

540
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,600
How come you can't accept him?

541
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,100
- Can't you give him a chance?
- Dad's dead because of him!

542
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,800
Why are you forcing me
to accept him?

543
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,500
He chose the wrong road!
It's his own fault!

544
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,600
I'm the cop, he's the thief.

545
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,200
In the eyes of the law,
we're on different paths.

546
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,100
Police!

547
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,500
- What's up, Ken?
- Your brother had an accident.

548
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,300
- He's at Margaret Hospital. Hurry!
- Got it.

549
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,500
What happened to my brother?

550
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,700
I believe he was set up by Sing.
It was an ambush.

551
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,900
Is he okay?

552
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,600
Hey, you can't go in!

553
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,300
I tried to stop him from
going alone, but he insisted.

554
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,400
I hope you'll cooperate with us. Keep
us informed of your whereabouts.

555
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,900
Come on, being a hero is easy.

556
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,900
Just jump.

557
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,900
Times have changed,
if you don't cooperate with us...

558
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,300
...that'll be your only choice.

559
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,900
You can't go to the police.
You're as dirty as I am.

560
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,100
What's going on?

561
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,700
Everybody stop fighting!

562
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,100
This is to teach Ho a lesson.

563
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,100
Everyone stop fighting!

564
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,400
Kick his ass!

565
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,400
Stop!

566
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,100
Let's talk about it!

567
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,100
We've worked so hard
for a better life!

568
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,900
Don't throw it all away
and end up in jail again!

569
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Stop fighting!

570
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,000
Stop, you bastard!

571
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,100
Come on, run, go!

572
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,400
You stay here, you bastard!

573
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,200
Stay here, if you got the guts!

574
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,800
You bastards!

575
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,700
Ken, it's my fault.

576
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,200
I didn't mean to involve you!

577
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,600
If you do this, you're just like them!

578
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,900
They beat on people
because they are weak.

579
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,000
If you hit them back,
you'll be back where you started.

580
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,000
It's so hard to change paths.
Why'd you bother?

581
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,100
Who is this guy?
Come on, let's pick him up.

582
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,600
Ken! Ho!

583
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,500
Come here, come look!

584
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,900
Mark!

585
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,300
Hurry, go and get the first aid kit.

586
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,800
Hurry!

587
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,300
Ken, what do we do now?

588
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,300
You get out of here.

589
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,400
Police, out of the car!

590
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,400
Oh, come on...

591
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,000
...are the police above the law?
I'll send my insurance claim to you.

592
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,000
Smart ass. Get out of here!

593
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,000
I didn't realize Hong Kong
looked so beautiful at night.

594
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,900
Such beauty can vanish in a blink.

595
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,100
Really it isn't worth it.

596
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,900
Ho...

597
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,500
...let's start all over again.

598
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,200
One last job and we'll leave
Hong Kong and vanish!

599
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,000
Mark...

600
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,400
You've never been afraid
of anything...

601
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,300
...why do you fear Sing?

602
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,100
Don't push me...
I can't get involved again.

603
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,600
What's done is done. It's over.

604
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,500
Not yet. Not as long as I'm alive!

605
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,700
There's no difference between one
more job, or ten more, or a hundred!

606
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,900
I let you kill Sing, then what?

607
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,800
I've already lost a brother...

608
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,100
...I don't want to lose you too.

609
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,500
Mark, don't you see?

610
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,900
I don't need your pity!

611
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,800
You don't owe me a thing!

612
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,900
I would never force a friend
to go against their will.

613
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,300
I have my own principles!

614
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,900
I can't live like this anymore!

615
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,300
Do you think I like to beg?

616
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,300
Three years like this!
This is my chance to get out!

617
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,600
I have to prove myself!
Not because I'm better than them...

618
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
...but to prove I can get back
what I've lost!

619
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,500
Look at yourself. Can you see
what you've become?

620
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,800
Before, people rejected you.

621
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,500
Now, you can't take two steps
without someone following you!

622
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,700
Have you ever fought for a chance?

623
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,900
You haven't.

624
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,700
No!

625
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,000
I don't want to be like you.

626
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,100
Mark!

627
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,200
What happened?

628
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,400
I want to get something back.

629
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,300
Stand back!

630
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,000
Go get the tape.

631
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,400
Think about this.
You won't get away.

632
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,000
Don't move!

633
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,000
Stop! Switch off!

634
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,900
- Go, get out of here.
- Open the door.

635
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,800
Thanks, Uncle Chan.

636
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,700
Don't let him escape!

637
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,500
You bastard!

638
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,500
You bastard! I told you
not to play with fire!

639
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,300
Bastard.

640
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,300
If Ho gives the Police that tape...

641
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,500
...it won't just be your head, bastard!

642
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,400
Our whole organization
will collapse!

643
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,200
Have you finished?
Bastard... bastard?!

644
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,600
When I was making you rich,
was I a bastard?

645
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,500
I'm sorry I ever trusted you!

646
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,400
If you don't get that tape back,
I'll kill you!

647
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,800
Kill me then.

648
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,000
Three years ago I betrayed Ho.

649
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,000
You think I'm scared of you?

650
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,700
You'll suffer the consequences!

651
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,300
You put me in charge.
We'll go down together!

652
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,400
Hello?

653
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,700
Hello, Ho? What the hell happened?

654
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,100
Mr. Yiu, I want to talk to Sing.

655
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,500
Sing? Hold on.

656
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,100
No matter what, get him
to return the tape, okay bastard?

657
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,100
Ho, stop fooling around.

658
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,900
Let's talk about this.

659
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,100
At 10 PM, bring $2 million to the
Temple in exchange for the tape.

660
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,000
Then, have a boat ready 
for us at Surf Bay.

661
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,100
Is that all?

662
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,700
I want cash.

663
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,600
- And come in person.
- I'll be there.

664
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,300
So, what did Ho say, bastard?

665
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,300
What did he say?

666
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,900
What?!

667
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,600
- He'll meet you for dinner tonight.
- Okay, I'll be waiting.

668
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,200
Sung Sir.

669
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,300
Sung Sir.

670
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Come in.

671
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,200
Sir, I've got some news.

672
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,500
Sung Tse Ho and the cripple
had a falling out with Sing.

673
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,200
They're blackmailing him.
The exchange is tonight.

674
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,300
- Do you know where and when?
- I'll find out.

675
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,700
Hello? Yes, I...

676
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,700
Thanks.

677
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,800
Sing just withdrew $2 million dollars
from the bank.

678
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,500
Cancel any leave!
Put everyone on alert!

679
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,600
Yes, sir.

680
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,300
Mr. Mok, let me in on the action.

681
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,800
You're still injured.
Why are you here?

682
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,200
I'm all right, it's not serious.

683
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,800
Go home and rest!

684
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,600
I'm okay. See, I can lift this chair.

685
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,400
You're not wanted this time!

686
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,500
My brother is the thief, not me!

687
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,000
I've always fulfilled my duties!

688
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,200
You know the rules!

689
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,400
- Your brother is involved!
- Ever since my father died...

690
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,800
...I've been after Sing.

691
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,100
I know more about this 
case than anyone!

692
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,800
You'll bring him in yourself?

693
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,400
I'll bring him in myself. 
I will.

694
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,600
You bet I'll bring him in.

695
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Kit, be practical.

696
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,800
Jackie...

697
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,800
...I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight.

698
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,300
You're giving up?

699
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,600
You have to get this package 
to Kit before nine tonight.

700
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,400
The contents are
very important to him.

701
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,800
Will you come back?

702
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight!

703
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,900
He told me to give you this.
It's important.

704
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Kit, the tape I've enclosed...

705
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,700
...has the evidence you need
to nail Sing.

706
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,800
I've arranged a meeting
with Sing tonight at Surf Bay.

707
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,500
You can arrest me as well,
I don't care.

708
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,000
I've decided not to stay
in Hong Kong.

709
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,800
Kit, what are you going to do?

710
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,000
Arrest him.

711
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,800
No, you can't arrest him!
You can't!

712
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,100
Get off!

713
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,400
Kit... !

714
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,400
Where is Ho?
The food is already cold!

715
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,200
You know what to say, right?

716
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,900
Do you believe there's a god?

717
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,900
Sure, I'm a god.

718
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,700
A god can be human.

719
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,400
Anyone who controls
their own destiny is a god.

720
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,300
Sometimes, there's things
you can't control.

721
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,700
You win some, you lose some.

722
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,700
Don't move.

723
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,800
And the money?

724
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,000
You got the tape?

725
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,600
The police have it.

726
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,500
Don't open it!

727
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,000
There's a bomb inside.

728
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,200
Did you think it would be so easy?

729
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,200
Did I scare you?

730
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,900
You're no fun to play with.

731
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,600
Holy shit.

732
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Fuck you!

733
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,100
After Sung Tse Ho arrived,
he and Master quarreled.

734
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,000
He asked Master for $2 million.

735
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,400
Said he's leaving from Surf Bay
tonight. Then, I heard shooting.

736
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,200
That's him.

737
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,800
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

738
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,500
- Are you willing to testify?
- Sure.

739
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,500
- You're going down, you bastard.
- And you're going with me.

740
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,500
Get out!

741
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,300
- Get out!
- Move!

742
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,700
Get out!

743
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,100
Be smart, let him go!

744
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,900
Come out!

745
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,500
Don't hide!

746
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,300
Move!

747
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,500
Ho, come aboard!

748
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,200
You go on ahead.

749
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,100
You said we'd leave together.

750
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
I have some unfinished business.

751
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,700
I'll catch up.

752
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,200
Mark, get out of here!

753
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,200
I'll see you later.

754
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,500
Move!

755
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,600
Release him or your brother is dead!

756
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,600
I don't think so!

757
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,500
One for the other!

758
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,700
Go.

759
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,200
- Go.
- Move!

760
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,100
I won't let you go.

761
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,800
I know.

762
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,300
Over here!

763
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,000
Get over here!

764
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,100
This is your brother!
Take a good look at him!

765
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,100
Take a good look!

766
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,800
Whatever he's done in the past,
he's more than paid you back!

767
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
He's trying to change his life around!

768
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,100
Why can't you accept him?

769
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,500
Why?

770
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,100
To be brothers...

771
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,400
Mark!

772
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,300
Mark!

773
01:30:58,700 --> 01:30:59,900
Sing!

774
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,700
Miss, you can't go in.

775
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,800
Sing!

776
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,800
Sung Tse Ho, you're surrounded
by the police!

777
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,400
You have three minutes to
come out with your hands up!

778
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,600
Out of bullets?

779
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,400
I guess I'll go surrender.

780
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,500
I'll be okay. You on the other hand...

781
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,600
You see, I have money. A few days
in court and I'll be a free man.

782
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,900
If you have money,
you can turn black to white.

783
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,900
This, I learned from you.

784
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,400
I pity your brother.

785
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,400
Because of you,
his white has become black.

786
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,600
And it's your fault.

787
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,200
Kit...

788
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,200
...you've done nothing wrong.
We are on different paths.

789
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,800
Yours is the right one.

790
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,700
I lost my way before...

791
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,900
...but I want to find my way back
if it's not too late.

792
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,900
